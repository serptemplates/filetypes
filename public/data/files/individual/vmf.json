      "Valve Corporation develops Hammer Editor to allow users to design 3D environments by placing objects, applying textures, configuring lighting, and defining interactive elements using an entity-based system. Earlier versions of Valve Hammer Editor saved maps in the .MAP format, which is still used in some cases for interoperability. However, the VMF format is a more structured format that allows modders to easily edit, share, and troubleshoot maps before compiling them into the playable BPS format used by the game engine."
