      "FVT files are supported by the FAST Search & Transfer ASA Java applet player, which was used in select web browsers to download, decompress, and display play FAST video. FVT files are also supported by the Fast Search & Transfer ASA EPOC native code player. The EPOC operating system became Symbian OS in 1998.",
      "NOTE: FAST was eventually purchased by Microsoft in 2008 and used as a high-speed search engine system for enterprise searches. FVT files are no longer used."
