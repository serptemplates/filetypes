      "Developers utilize C# for building applications that run in the .NET ecosystem, which is a software framework that provides a standard method for building and deploying applications (primarily in Windows). The programming language is component-oriented, and some of its features include nullable types, exception handling, garbage collection, lambda expressions, asynchronous operations, and Language Integrated Query (LINQ) syntax. It also is flexible (through versioning) to ensure compatibility as technologies evolve.",
