      "Null is a type of malware utilized by cybercriminals that takes a user's files hostage and forces him to pay the perpetrator to unlock the files. It is most often introduced to a victim's computer through spam emails with malicious file attachments that are downloaded and run by unsuspecting users. These email attachments may be JavaScript .JS files or .DOCX files with macros that appear to be normal attachments, but they actually contain the Null virus.",
      "When the ransomware runs on a user's computer, it encrypts files on their computer and adds the .null extension onto the names of the files. The targeted files are typically documents, images, videos, and backup files, such as .DOCX, .JPG, .MP4, and .DB files. For example, a spreadsheet.xlsx file becomes spreadsheet.xlsx.null.",
      "The virus then generates a pop-up window with several tabs explaining the hostile takeover of the user's files. The tabs include information about what occurred to the computer, the encryption used on the files, the list of encrypted files, how the user can recover his files, and how the user can make the Bitcoin ransom payment."

The best way to recover your files is to retrieve them from a recent backup or perform a System Restore to a point before your computer was infected."
