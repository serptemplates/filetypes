      "Mac users can use DiskCatalogMaker to create catalogs that list the files stored on their hard drive, external drives, CD and DVD discs, and other media. Typically, these catalogs are saved as DCMF files. However, if a user wants to include thumbnail images in their catalog (to help them recognize specific files), they can save the catalog as a DCMD file. DCMD files contain thumbnails for files that can be opened using macOS's Quick Look feature, such as images, movies, audio files, and documents.",
