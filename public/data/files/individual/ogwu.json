      "OGWU files replaced .OGW files, which were used to save workbooks in Origin before the 2018 version. OGWU files are saved in a unicode format which features performance advantages over the older OGW file format.",
      "You can open OGWU files with Origin and Origin Viewer. Origin is only available for Windows and is the primary program used to create, open, and edit OGWU files. Origin Viewer is also commonly used since it is a free alternative to Origin and can be used in Windows and macOS.",
      "To open an OGWU file in Origin, select File → Open..., select the \"Origin Window .ogwu\" file type, navigate to the OGWU file location, and click Open.",
      "You can save Origin Workbooks as templates without data in order to preserve a layout to be used with other workbooks. To do this, select File → Save Template As... and Origin will create an OTWU file to store the template. You can also save the workbook as a template with analysis, by selecting File → Save Workbook As Analysis Template..., which will be stored in an OGWU file."
