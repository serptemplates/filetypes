      "You can create CTEX files the same way in Godot Engine 4 as you created STEX files in Godot Engine 3. For example, you can copy your image (likely a PNG image) to the project folder or drag and drop it into the project folder. Godot automatically imports the image files internally, appends the .ctex file extension onto the files, and then places them in a hidden res:/​/​.godot/​imported/​ folder."
