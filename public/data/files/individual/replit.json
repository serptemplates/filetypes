      "Replit is an online IDE that takes its name from the REPL (read-evaluate-print loop) acronym. Most notably, Replit allows developers to import code packages and projects from GitHub, so they can edit and run those projects in Replit. Replit projects are commonly referred to as repls.",
      "When a developer creates a new repl, Replit automatically creates a REPLIT configuration file for that repl. The REPLIT file is typically hidden, but developers can view the file by selecting Show hidden files from Replit's three-dot file tree menu.",
      "Each REPLIT file is a .TOML file that contains a list of project-related settings. For example, the run command tells Replit how to run the program the REPLIT file is associated with, the language setting tells Replit what programming languages the project uses, and the [packager] setting tells Replit the program's package management configuration."
