      "In Linux operating systems, the FSTAB file is read by the mount command to determine the options that should be applied when mounting a device. The file includes data describing the device name, mount point, file system type, and the partition archiving schedule. It also contains data determining whether the filesystem should be mounted at boot and the order that the file system check (fsck) utility should check the partition for errors during boot time.",
      "NOTE: You can use Android Explorers to access FSTAB files located on your Android device. The file is named vold.fstab and located in the /​system/​core/​rootdir/​etc/​ directory."
