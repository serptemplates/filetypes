      "Oxygen Forensics develops software that aids in the extraction and analysis of data, such as messages from phones, sensitive documents from computers, and customer data from cloud services. Federal agencies, corporate investigators, and law enforcement primarily use Oxygen Forensics software to collect digital evidence for legal cases and other investigatory purposes.",
      "After importing extracted data into Detective, you can analyze and organize it with various reporting tools included in the software. Then, you can save the data as an OFBX file to share with other Detective users. Or, you can send it to non-Detective users with the free and portable Oxygen Forensics Viewer utility."
