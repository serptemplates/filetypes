      "BPMN Editor is a diagram creation and editing tool that allows you to create flowcharts and process diagrams. You can then export these diagrams as .SVG files or use bpmn-js, a BPMN rendering toolkit, to embed the diagrams in a webpage or application.",
      "Primarily, users access BPMN Editor from the website demo.bpmn.io. After using BPMN editor to create a diagram, you can save that diagram as a local BPMN file. This allows you to re-open and continue editing the diagram you've created at a later time, or embed your BPMN file within a webpage or application."

Opening a BPMN file in a source code editor, like Visual Studio Code, is more useful than opening it in a regular text editor, like Microsoft Notepad, because source code editors highlight XML syntax."
