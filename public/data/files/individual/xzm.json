      "The XZM file is used by the Porteus Linux OS to store multiple files that can be installed and uninstalled into the Porteus directory structure by double-clicking the file. It uses the Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain algrotihm (LZMA2) to compress its file contents. One of the main advantages of the XZM file is that you can quickly install and uninstall files, which reduces the clutter of unused files.",
      "NOTE: Porteus is a Linux OS designed to be lightweight and portable. It can be run from bootable storage media, such as a USB flash drive, hard drive, or CD."
