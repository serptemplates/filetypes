      "Apple introduced iMovie in 1999 as part of Mac OS 8. Throughout its different versions, the software has saved projects in various formats. Early versions of iMovie saved files as .IMOVIEPROJECT files, then Apple replaced the format with the IMOVIEPROJ file in versions 5 and 6 (2005 and 2006).",
      "In 2007, iMovie '08 saved projects as RCPROJECT files until iMovie '11 (2010). Then, in 2013, iMovie 10 began storing all project information in .IMOVIELIBRARY bundles with .IMOVIEEVENT files.",
      "NOTE: Because iMovie projects contain the actual video and audio clips used to compose the movie, they are often several gigabytes."
