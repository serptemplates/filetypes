      "Apple Motion uses several extensions for saving different project types. Effects created in Motion are saved as .MOEF files, generators are saved as .MOTN files, and transitions are saved as .MOTR files.",
      "By default, MOTI files are saved in the following directory in macOS:",
      "/​Users/​username/​Movies/​Motion Templates/​Titles/​",
      "MOTI files are typically accompanied by two .PNG thumbnail previews, a .MOV preview of the MOTI title, and a media folder that stores all the media included in the project.",
      "Apple Motion is used for creating titles, effects, transitions, and generators for video projects. It is designed to be a companion program to a video editor for creating an effect, title, transition, which is then imported into the video editor. Motion is most commonly used with Final Cut Pro because of its similar appearance and integration with the video editor."
