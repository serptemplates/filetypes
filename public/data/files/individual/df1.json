      "NOTE: DF1 files used by Omnis Studio are formatted differently than Omnis 7 files. Therefore, old DF1 files cannot be used with Omnis Studio. However, new versions of DF1 files are included with Omnis Studio. For example, the icon data file \"Userpic.df1\" used by Omnis 7 is replaced by \"Omnispic.df1\" in Omnis Studio. Other DF1 files can be converted or upgraded within the program.",
