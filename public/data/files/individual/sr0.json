      "SR0 files are used for sending diagnostics reports to SecuROM support when encountering trouble with a purchased CD/DVD that is protected by SecuROM. After generating an SR0 file, you can send it to SecuROM's support team for help with your application. SR0 files store copy-protection information about the analyzed program. They are compressed and incorporate encryption so that the contents can only be reviewed by SecuROM support.",
      "NOTE: SecuROM technology is commonly used for including anti-piracy and DRM protection for purchased video games. Therefore, SecuROM components are included on installation discs and are required to install and play the game."
