      "High quality and better compression ratioCan easily be utilized in high-resolution movies like 2K or 4K.Having better adaptivity having extra coding modesHEVC contains an in-loop deblocking filter, where the blocking items around the transform edges within the rebuilt picture are smoothed to enhance the picture quality and compression proficiency.HEVC introduces a new filtering stage called the sample-adaptive offset (SAO) filter, which can offer both an impartial and development and enhancement in video quality.Useful in reducing the bandwidth with larger resolutionsPotential to back resolutions of 8192 x 4320 pixelsDesigned mainly for top resolution formatsIntra coding in H265 allows 35 prediction modes",
      "In 2013, the Joint Collaborative Team on Video Coding (JCT-VC) established the H.265 video codec. The H.265 codec offers up to 50 percent better data compression than its predecessor, the H.264 codec. This means the same video, saved at the same level of quality can take up 50 percent less hard drive space when saved using the H.265 codec, instead of the H.264 codec.",
      "The H.265 codec's superior video compression has also allowed video creators to create, save, and transmit higher-quality videos. For example, the H.265 codec made transmitting 8K video more feasible, since those high-resolution videos could now be compressed into manageably-sized files.",
      "Most times, videos saved using the H.265 codec are saved using common video file types, such as .MOV and .MP4. Those files may use H.265 compression, but are not .h265 files. On rare occasions, however, you may encounter an H.265 video saved as an .HEVC or H265 file."
