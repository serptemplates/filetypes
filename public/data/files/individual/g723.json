      "G.723 is one of several ADPCM audio standards created by the ITU, which is a communications technology-oriented division of the United Nations. It is related to both the G.721 standard and the G.726 standard, which also describe codecs used to transmit spoken audio over a network. G.726 is the newest of these standards; it replaced both the G.721 and G.723 standards.",
      "Primarily, the G.723 audio was used to encode audio transmitted over international or wireless phone networks. So, a G723 audio file likely contains audio spoken during a phone conversation."
