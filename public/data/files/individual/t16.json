      "When you begin a tax return in Tax Software you can choose to import data from a previous year whether it be from your H&R Block account or another tax service like TurboTax or TaxAct. If you have no information to import you will be asked to enter your basic information and social security number. The software then guides you as you add other tax information, which includes any 2016 life changes, income, adjustments, deductions, and credits on the federal and state levels.",
      "When you save your tax return the program creates a T16 file to store your information. The file allows you to save your progress and resume at a later time. Once you finish your tax return, you can electronically file it directly from the H&R Block software or print and mail the return to the appropriate tax authorities.",
      "The file extension appended on to H&R Block tax returns indicates the year of the return. T16 files store information for 2016 tax returns, .T15 files store information for 2015 tax returns, .T14 files store information for 2014 tax returns, and so on.",
      "NOTE: The T16 file may also be used to create a backup of a tax return for archival purposes. To create a backup in Tax Software select File → Backup Tax Return..."
