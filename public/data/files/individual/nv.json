      "NV files can be converted to the newer .NV2 format using a NewViews for DOS component called NVEXPORT, a procedure library made available by Q.W. Page. After conversion, the created file can be opened by NewViews 2 the first time NewViews 2 is opened.",
      "NOTE: NewViews for DOS was originally released in 1986. That year it won PC Magazine's award for Technical Excellence. The software is still used by some organizations that have not transitioned to NewViews 2 (NV2) for Windows."
