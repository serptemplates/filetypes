      "JARC files are similar to .ARC (Nintendo Archive) files. Both contain assets used in a Nintendo video game. However, the JARC format is a newer archive format that is used in WiiU and 3DS video games.",
      "Typically, JARC files contain some combination of .JMDL (WiiU or 3DS Model), .JTEX (WiiU or 3DS Texture), and .JMOT (WiiU or 3DS Animation) files. Together, these files are used to show and animate in-game characters, objects, locations, and other items."
