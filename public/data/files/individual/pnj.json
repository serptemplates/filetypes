      "Opening a PNJ file (Portable Network JPEG) can be tricky, as it’s a rare and largely obsolete format. Since PNJ files were later renamed to JNG (JPEG Network Graphic), support for them is limited in modern software. However, you can try the following methods:\n\nRename the File Extension\n\nTry renaming the file extension from .pnj to .jng. Some software that supports JNG files might be able to open it. To do this:Right-click on the file.Choose “Rename” and change .pnj to .jng.Confirm the change and try opening it with compatible software.\n\nUse Image Viewers that Support JNG\n\nSince JNG is more widely recognized than PNJ, you can use specific software known to support it:\n\nXnView or IrfanView: These are free image viewers that support a wide range of image formats, including JNG.GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program): This open-source image editor may support JNG files.\n\nConvert the File\n\nIf you’re unable to open the file directly, you can try converting it using online file converters like Convertio or Zamzar. Upload the PNJ file and attempt to convert it to a more common format, such as PNG or JPEG.\n\nOpen with a Hex Editor\n\nIf the file still doesn’t open, try using a hex editor to inspect the file contents. This will allow you to see the raw data and potentially identify its format. If the file is mislabeled, this may give clues for how to properly open it."
