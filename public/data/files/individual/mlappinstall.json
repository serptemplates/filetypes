      "MATLAB is a technical computing system that engineers and scientists may use to analyze, visualize, and manipulate data. Among its features, the software provides an integrated development environment (IDE) to develop apps, which include a tool for visualizing blood pressure data, a finance calculator, etc.",
      "With this feature, you can design the interface of the app and program its capabilities (and save it as an .MLAPP file). Then, when you are ready to distribute it, you can compile the MLAPP file to a web or standalone desktop app or as an MLAPPINSTALL package to share with other MATLAB users.",
