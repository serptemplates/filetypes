      "You most likely will only encounter the CM0013 file if you use a storage device to connect to a Smart TV to play multimedia files. Once you disconnect your storage device from the Samsung Smart TV and connect it to your computer your files are hidden or locked and the CM0013 file is the only file that appears on your storage device. If you delete the CM0013 file and reconnect the storage device to the Smart TV, your files may reappear.",
