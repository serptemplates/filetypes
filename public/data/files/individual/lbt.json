      "Visual FoxPro was software that developers used to build database applications. Along with its various database features, it included tools for designing labels, such as mailing labels and product tags. While the LBX files store the actual design for the labels, including their layout and formatting, the LBT files store helpful information related to the labels to assist whoever may modify the labels.",
