      "The IRCAM format was developed in the 1980s by the Institut de Recherche et Coordination Acoustique/Musique (IRCAM) in France. The format was primarily used by audio applications, which includes the Csound music computing system, running in the Berkeley Software Distribution (BSD), a UNIX-based operating system developed at the University of California, Berkeley. Various academic research centers utilized these audio programs in the BSD operating system to compose and save musical recordings.",
      "NOTE: Since audio files saved in the IRCAM format primarily use the .sf extension, IRCAM files are uncommon."
