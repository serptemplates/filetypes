      "JetBrains developed Kotlin in order to alleviate some of the common issues that arise in Java development. For example, while Java is considered a verbose language, Kotlin is more concise and can reduce the number of lines of code by 40%. Kotlin is also is statically typed so that applications are less likely to produce Null Pointer Exceptions (NPEs) due to non-nullable type support.",
      "Kotlin is 100% compatible with Java and is supported by major Java IDEs, such as Intellij IDEA, Android Studio, NetBeans, and Eclipse."
