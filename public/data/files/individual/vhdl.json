      "VHDL was created in the 1980s to develop a high-speed integrated circuit. It has since become an industry-standard language for describing digital systems at the structural or behavioral levels in a text-based format. The VHDL file can be used to manufacture a physical circuit such as a motherboard, processor, or memory module."
