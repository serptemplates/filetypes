      "The PubMed format was developed to replace the Research Information Systems (RIS) citation format in order to better accommodate bibliographic information provided by the PubMed search engine. PubMed is developed by the U.S. National Library of Medicine and makes available citations for biomedical literature from life science journals, online books, and the MEDLINE database.",

Then, select the desired citation information you want to be included in the NBIB file, click \"Create File,\" and choose the save location (choosing the location prompts the download of the NBIB file through your web browser). Citation information saved in the PubMed format can be exported as a .TXT or NBIB file.",
