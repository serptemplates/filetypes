      "HEIF, or H.265, is a digital photo storage format that saves images at a higher quality and in smaller-sized files than the .JPEG format. There are two brands, or variations, of HEIF that provide different features: HEIC and HEIX. HEIC is the most well-known because of its usage in iOS devices for storing photos. Images saved in the HEIC variation use the .heic file extension (.HEIC files).",
      "The lesser-known variation, HEIX, provides differing features from HEIC. The primary difference is its support for color profiles that extend past 8-bit depth per color channel and chroma subsampling past 4:2:0 (4:2:2 or 4:4:4). Images saved in the HEIX variation use the .hif file extension."
