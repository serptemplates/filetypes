      "XRD data was originally stored in binary format to save space but did not allow easy analysis of the data. The XRDML format was eventually introduced, enabling users to more conveniently access and share their measurement results. The XRDML file is an XML based file that contains XRD measurement data in ASCII format.",
      "Powder diffraction is an analytical scientific technique used to identify the phase of a crystalline material. It can also reveal information about unit cell dimensions."
