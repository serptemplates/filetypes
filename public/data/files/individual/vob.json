      "When a DVD is opened on a computer, VIDEO_TS is the top level directory with AUDIO_TS. AUDIO_TS is empty and is not used. Inside the VIDEO_TS directory, there are VOB, BUP, and IFO files. VOB files contain the MPEG content. These are broken into 1 GB or less sized chunks so that these are compatible with all the operating systems. The IFO files contain information regarding the menus and the title structure. The BUK files are backup files of the IFO files with the same name. These files are meant to be kept in a separate area physically so that in case the IFO file is damaged due to physical damage to the DVD, the BUK file can provide the same information.",
      "DVD Forum, an international organization comprising various companies, developed the VOB format. They based the format on the MPEG program stream format, and most files are formatted as MPEG-2 system streams.",
      "Since most commercial DVDs use copyright protection, VOB files extracted from the DVD may be encrypted, which may result in an error when copying the file to another location. Several decrypting programs are available for playing the VOB file without the proper credentials. However, the programs may be illegal in certain countries."
