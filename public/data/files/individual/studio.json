      "The STUDIO file was the primary file associated with versions 1 and 2 of Silhouette Studio. When you would create and save a design project, the STUDIO file was the default format used to store the design.",
      "However, with the release of version 3 of Silhouette Studio, the STUDIO file has been replaced by the .STUDIO3 file. The STUDIO file is still supported by version 3 of Silhouette Studio. You can also save your design as a STUDIO file, although this may leave some advanced features unsaved."
