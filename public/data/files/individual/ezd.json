      "Nanosurf easyScan is a system that allows physicists to image a material, make nanometer-scale measurements, and record other topographic and spectrographic data. An easyScan system consists of an AFM or STM and accompanying easyScan control software. Physicists create EZD files by saving measurements within easyScan control software."
