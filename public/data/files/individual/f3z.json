      "You can open F3Z files using Fusion 360. To open the file, select \"Upload\" in the Fusion 360 Data panel and choose the F3Z file. The contents of the file will be loaded in Fusion 360, displaying the main assembly in the panel with the F3D design(s), allowing you to view and edit them.",
      "You can create an F3Z archive in Fusion 360 by selecting File → Export... and choosing the F3Z archive format under Type.",
      "Since F3Z files are compressed with Zip compression, they can be decompressed using a Zip decompression program, such as Corel WinZip, 7-Zip, WinRAR, or Apple Archive Utility. Simply rename the .f3z extension to .zip and decompress it. You can then manually extract the contents of the F3Z file, which typically include an F3D Fusion 3D design file, a JSON file describing the design, and a JSON file containing the F3Z manifest. When you are finished you can compress it with Zip compression again using a Zip utility, then rename the .zip extension to .f3z.",
      "NOTE: Autodesk Fusion 360 provides various cloud-based features and is often used for collaboration."
