      "Each MXL file has a ZIP-based XML format that must have a META-INF/container.xml file which describes the starting point of the MusicXML version of the file. There is no corresponding .xsd file defined for the MXL file format.\n\nA simple container.xml file has contents as follow. This example is taken from Dichterliebe01.mxl file available on the MakeMusic web site.\n\n<?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"> <container> <rootfiles> <rootfile full-path=\"Dichterliebe01.musicxml\" media-type=\"application/vnd.recordare.musicxml+xml\"/> </rootfiles> </container>\n\nIn this example, the element is the document element. The element can contain one or more elements, with the first element describing the MusicXML root. A MusicXML file used as a may have , , or as its document element.",
      "MXL files are not as common as the standard MusicXML scores, which are saved as .XML files. However, since MXL files are compressed, they used less storage space and are useful for sending over email and backing up on external media devices."
