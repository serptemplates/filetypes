      "In 2011, the European Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI) created the Associated Signature Container Extended format. It is used to hold a group of protected files and digital signatures and/or timestamp tokens associated with those files. Some software, such as qDigiDoc, can load ASICE files and use the credentials they contain to open the protected files they contain.",
      "All ASICE files are saved in the Zip format. The electronic signatures they contain are saved as CAdES or XAdES signatures. The timestamp tokens are saved in Internet Engineering Task Force-recognized formats."
