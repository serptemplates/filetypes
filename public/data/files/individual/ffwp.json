      "After creating a form, users save that form as an FFWP file. They can then embed the FFWP file in a web application, to allow users who access the application to fill out the form. (These web applications typically save users' answers to a database.) Users can also distribute FFWP files offline, to allow others to fill out and submit the form without accessing the internet."
