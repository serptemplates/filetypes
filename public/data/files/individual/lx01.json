      "The LX01 file allows users to group smaller collections of digital evidence without having to load the entire EX01 evidence file to view them. The LX01 format replaced the .L01 format, which provides more advanced security features such as AES256 encryption with keypairs or passwords, LZ compression, and the option for SHA-1 or MD5 hashing.",
