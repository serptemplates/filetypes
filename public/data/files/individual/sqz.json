      "Sorenson Squeeze was a video enhancement and conversion program available for Windows and macOS. It was discontinued in 2018.",
      "Squeeze supported a wide variety of input and output video file formats, as well as many additional conversion options. Users could specify their video's container, codec, aspect ratio, and more. Users could also create videos optimized for use with YouTube, Amazon Web Services, and other online services.",
      "When a user worked with a video in Squeeze, that video's settings and version history were saved in an SQZ file. SQZ files also contain references to the locations at which videos imported into Squeeze are stored. If a user moves a video referenced in an SQZ file, the file may not load correctly in Squeeze."
