      "Indie video game developers use OGMO Editor to create levels for 2D video games. They can then save these levels as .JSON files and include them in a video game development project.",
      "Each OGMO Editor level creation project is saved as an OGMO file. OGMO files are renamed JSON files, which include a variety of project data and metadata. For example, each OGMO file includes a project's name, the version of OGMO that created the project, the project's settings, layers, entities, and tilesets (specified from OGMO's Edit Project screen), and the project's default, minimum, and maximum level size."
