      "Toribash is a 3D turn-based fighting game developed by Nabi Studios, where players control ragdoll-like characters by manipulating their joints and muscles to perform complex moves. Instead of preset attacks, players adjust individual body parts frame by frame to punch, kick, dodge, or throw their opponent.",
      "In Toribash, players can create or modify TBM files and use them to modify the game environment or character equipment during matches. For example, a TBM file might specify the shape and position of swords or other gear attached to a character, changing how the game plays or looks.",
      "NOTE: While TBM files are used for mods, Toribash saves match replays in a different format, using the .RPL extension."
