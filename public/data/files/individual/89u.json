      "Middle school, high school, and college students use TI-89 Titanium graphing calculators to plot functions, analyze numerical data, solve complex equations, and perform other mathematical operations. The TI-89 Titanium uses its own unique OS, which can be updated when the calculator is connected to a computer that has Texas Instruments TI Connect installed.",
      "Most often, to update a TI-89 Titanium calculator's OS, users simply click the Update button found in TI Connect. However, in certain rare scenarios, a user may have to manually update their TI-89 Titanium's OS. In those instances, the user will receive an 89U file from Texas Instruments, which they must manually install on their TI-89 Titanium."
