      "MIPMAPS files store multiple duplicate images that are saved at different resolutions. The appropriate image is rendered during gameplay depending on the resolution required. For example, an object that is farther away would use a lower resolution image texture in the MIPMAPS file, while a closer object would use a higher resolution image in the MIPMAPS file. This \"mipmapping\" method increases the rendering speed of textures and decreases aliasing, which is a distortion that occurs when a high-resolution image is displayed at a lower resolution.",
      "Most F1 gamers will not encounter MIPMAPS files since they are referenced by the game in the background and applied to 3D models in the game. The gamers that do come across MIPMAPS files are typically exploring sub-folders in the game installation directory looking to modify the appearances of objects that are visible during gameplay."
