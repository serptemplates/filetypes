      "You will most likely only encounter a PUG file if you are a web developer utilizing the Pug templating engine for generating dynamic HTML webpages. Pug allows developers to create webpages with re-usable static markup, while inserting dynamic elements on the pages that will be filled with information from an external source, like a database, later.",
      "For example, a developer may use a PUG file when creating a website where employees of a company can update their personal information. The PUG template contains static markup for the page layout that makes the appearance similar for each employee. However, the template also stores dynamic elements, like an “employeename” tag, that is filled in with the employee name from the database when a user requests the page.",
      "Pug may be utilized on the frontend (executed in web browsers) or on the backend (executed with NodeJS, a JavaScript runtime environment) of a website. It is one of many JavaScript templating engines used by web developers, along with EJS, Mustache, Handlebars, HAML, Vash, and Nunjucks.",
      "NOTE: Pug was formerly known as Jade but was renamed in 2015."
