      "BlackBerry devices allow users to encrypt the files stored on their SD (also known as media) card. When a user chooses to encrypt their files, the device creates a file named info.mkf, which contains the encryption key used to encrypt the files.",
      "Most BlackBerry users will never encounter or need to use info.mkf. Digital forensics professionals sometimes use info.mkf to recover a BlackBerry device's password (if the associated SD card's encryption was set to either Security Password or Device Password) and the files stored on an SD card."
