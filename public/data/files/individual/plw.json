      "A PLW file is a loadable library, similar to .DLL, that extends IDA's disassembling capabilities. Examples of additional functions that can be installed include the ability to export disasm information from idb or to enable integrated jump navigation and decompilation support. The plugin should be placed in the plugins directory of the application.",
      "NOTE: Different file extensions are used for different IDA plugins. The .P64 extension is used for Windows 64-bit, the .PLX extension is used by Linux 32-bit, and the .PLX64 extension is used by Linux 64-bit plugins."
