For example, co-workers conducting a team chat in Microsoft Teams can add Loop components that allow them to edit a piece of text together in real-time or vote on an issue.",
      "To ensure users have access to their Loop components in the future, each component is automatically saved in its creator's Microsoft OneDrive for Business storage. In the past, Microsoft Loop saved components as FLUID files. It now saves components as .LOOP files."
