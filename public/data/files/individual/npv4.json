      "Primarily, Android and iOS users use NapsternetV to spoof their location and mask their identity while browsing the Internet. This is especially useful for those who live in countries that restrict or monitor their populace's Internet access.",
      "To connect to a VPN, users can import one of many preexisting NPV4 files. These configuration files contain server login credentials and other VPN connection settings. Oftentimes, NPV4 files also include data cap settings, which ensure a NapsternetV user doesn't exceed their cellular plan's data limit while browsing the Internet.",
      "Users who have created their own NapsternetV VPN configuration can export that configuration as an NPV4 file. This allows them to retain a backup of their VPN settings and share it with others.",
      "NOTE: Previous versions of NapsternetV saved configuration files as NPV2 files."
