      "When a user installs a program with an installer created by InstallShield, the installer creates an ISU file and stores it in the program’s installation directory or a dedicated uninstall folder. The file may include instructions for deleting files, unregistering components, and removing registry entries associated with the program. Without the ISU file, InstallShield may not be able to completely remove the application, which could leave leftover files or settings on the system.",
      "System administrators, IT staff, or advanced users may encounter ISU files when troubleshooting installation and uninstallation issues. Regular users typically interact with them only indirectly when running a program’s built-in uninstall feature from the Windows Control Panel or Settings app."
