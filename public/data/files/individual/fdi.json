      "Commodore produced the Amiga line of computers in the 1980s and 90s. Amiga users created floppy disk images saved in various formats, including the .ADF, .ADZ, and .DMS formats. In 2000, developer Vincent Joguin created the FDI disk image format, to make sharing data between Amiga users easier.",
      "The FDI format is open-source, so most Amiga emulators can mount FDI disk images and access the data they contain. Also, unlike other Amiga disk images, FDI files can store raw low-level data, such as data required to support copy protection schemes. As such, FDI files are often larger than other Amiga disk images."
