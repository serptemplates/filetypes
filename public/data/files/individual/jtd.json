      "The JTD file is the main file type associated with Ichitaro, similarly to the .DOCX file type with Microsoft Word. When you create and save a document in Ichitaro, the JTD file is created to store the contents of the document. You can close and reopen the file in Ichitaro for further editing.",
      "Ichitaro was originally released in the early 1980s. It grew in popularity during the peak years of DOS until Microsoft Word emerged as a more popular word processor."
