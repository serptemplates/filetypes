      "HeaderThe header typically contains metadata about the model, such as the version of the file format and other general information.VerticesThis section contains the 3D coordinates of the model’s vertices. Vertices are the points in 3D space that make up the model’s mesh.NormalsNormals are vectors that are perpendicular to the surface of the model at each vertex. They are used for lighting calculations.Texture CoordinatesThese coordinates map the 2D textures onto the 3D model.FacesFaces (or polygons) define how vertices are connected to form the 3D shape. Typically, models are made up of triangles or quads.BonesBones are used for skeletal animation, allowing the model to move in a lifelike manner.AnimationsThis section includes the data for animating the model, such as keyframes and bone transformations.MaterialsMaterials define the appearance of the model’s surface, including textures, colors, and shading properties.GeosetsGeosets are collections of vertices, normals, and faces that make up parts of the model. Each geoset can have its own material.AttachmentsThese are points on the model where other objects can be attached, like weapons or effects.EventsEvents can trigger specific actions or effects during the model’s animation, like sound effects or particle emissions.",
