      "Opera Mini users can download webpages to view them without access to an Internet connection. Previously, when a user downloaded a webpage, it was saved as an OBML15 file. OBML15 files use the OBML file format, which is a compact format designed to reduce the size (and increase the download speed) of web content.",
      "OBML15 files replaced .OBML files with the release of Opera Mini version 5 and were themselves replaced by .OBML16 files in Opera Mini version 7. Opera Mini 7 and later versions do not support and cannot open OBML15 files."
