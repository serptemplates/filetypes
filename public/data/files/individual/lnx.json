      "Will Corley developed the Lynx (also known as LNX or Ultimate Lynx) format. The Lynx format was more common in the 1990s for uploading to a BBS but has since greatly decreased in usage due to the rise of other archiving formats, discontinuation of the Lynx archiver program, and the complexity of the Lynx format."
