      "Synthesizer V allows users to create, edit, and play back synthesized singing vocals. Users can then export the vocals they've created as .UST or .MID files. Synthesizer V projects, which are saved as SVP files, often contain many different vocal tracks, including primary vocals, backing vocals, and effects applied to those vocals.",
      "While SVP files appear as vocal tracks in Synthesizer V, they are actually plain text JSON files. When you open an SVP file in Synthesizer V, the program converts the text the file contains into the graphical elements that appear in Synthesizer V."
