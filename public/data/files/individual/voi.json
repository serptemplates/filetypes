      "Medical researchers, neuroscientists, and healthcare professionals working with advanced imaging data are the primary users of VOI files. The purpose of a VOI file is to make it easier to study specific brain regions by grouping them for comparison, measurement, or visualization.",
      "For example, a researcher might create VOIs around areas affected by a neurological disorder to track changes across multiple scans. Saving these regions in a VOI file allows consistent analysis across different imaging sessions.",
