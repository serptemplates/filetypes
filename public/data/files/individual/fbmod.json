      "The Frosty Tool Suite is a set of player-created tools used to modify Frostbite Engine video games. It includes the Frosty Editor, used to create mods, and the Frosty Mod Manager, used to install mods.",
      "Mods that players create using Frosty Editor are saved as FBMOD files. Typically, these files are packaged in .ZIP files, to reduce their file size. Mod creators often upload their FBMOD files to mod-sharing websites, such as NexusMods.com, to share them with other players.",
      "FBMOD files can contain a variety of different types of mods. For example, they may include aesthetic modifications to items or characters, or they may contain data used to modify a game's mechanics."
