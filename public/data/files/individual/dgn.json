      "MicroStation is a CAD program that architects and engineers use to draft technical drawings of buildings, construction projects, mechanical parts, and other items. It was initially published by Intergraph, before being acquired by Bentley Systems.",
      "Most versions of MicroStation allow users to open, create, and save DNG files. (Version 1 of MicroStation could only open DGN files, created by other Intergraph CAD programs.) However, different versions of MicroStation save DGN files in slightly different formats. Versions 7 and below of MicroStation save DGN files in the original ISFF format that Intergraph created in the 1980s. Versions 8 and above save DGN files in the V8 DGN format, created by Bentley Systems in 2000. Thus, old versions of MicroStation may not be able to open newer DGN files."

  "how_to_convert": {
    "instructions": [
      "Those who have access to Bentley Systems MicroStation, AutoDesk AutoCAD, or CorelCAD can use those programs to convert DGN files to other CAD technical drawing formats. For example, MicroStation can convert DGN files to the following formats:",
      ".DWG - AutoCAD Drawing",
      ".DXF - Drawing Exchange Format",
      ".SKP - SketchUp Document",
      "MicroStation can also convert DGN files to non-CAD formats, such as .OBJ, .JPG, .BMP, and .PDF.",
      "If you do not have access to any of the above CAD programs, you can use AutoDWG DGN to DWG Converter, a free Windows app, to convert DGN files to the DWG and DXF formats."
