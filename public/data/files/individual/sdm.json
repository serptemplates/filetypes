      "StarOffice Mail was part of the broader StarOffice suite, which included tools for word processing, spreadsheets, presentations, and more. The mail client allowed users to send, receive, and organize email directly within the suite. When users composed or received messages, the email client saved emails as SDM files.",
      "Each SDM file contains a complete record of a single email, including metadata such as sender, recipient, date, and subject. Any file attachments were embedded within the same file, making SDM files helpful in archiving or sharing individual messages.",
      "StarOffice Mail and the SDM format became obsolete after Sun Microsystems acquired StarDivision in 1999 and transitioned the suite to OpenOffice.org. Sun Microsystems discontinued the mail client during this transition, and support for SDM files ceased. As a result, SDM files are now rare."
