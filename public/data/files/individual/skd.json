      "The Max Payne game uses the SKD, .KFS, and .KF2 formats to create the different aspects of the game environment. The SKD file is often found with the KFS file since it stores data that provides the texture for the character model. KF2 files are also commonly used by the game for weapon models, animations, etc.",
      "NOTE: The SKD file for Max Payne is located in the data\\​database\\​skins\\​max_payne path of the game directory."
