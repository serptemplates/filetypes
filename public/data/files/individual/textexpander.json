      "TextExpander enables you to save snippets of text that you repeatedly type, whether you are at home or the office, in order to save time. The snippets could be source code, directions, names, brand message, etc. You can then assign a shortcut to the snippet, which allows you to call and place a snippet through the typing of a shortcut.",
      "TextExpander saves the snippets in the cloud and updates across all of your synced devices. However, if you do not have sync setup or do not want to set it up, you can transfer the TEXTEXPANDER file by copying it and manually placing it on the other computer. The file's default location on a Mac is in the following location:",
