      "EUC was developed in the 1980s to extend the capabilities of Unix Code as computing technology expanded globally. It is based on the ISO/IEC 2022 standard produced by the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) and the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC).",
      "The EUC format supports multiple character sets within a single text string, enabling the use of both Kanji (or Korean or simplified Chinese) and other characters without conflict. This capability made EUC a widely adopted encoding standard for handling multilingual text in Unix and Linux operating systems for text editors, databases, programming environments, and more."
