      "To verify that meeting attendees can view UCF files, choose the \"Request that attendees verify rich media players\" option when scheduling a meeting in WebEx.",
      "NOTE: UCF files can be created with the WebEx Universal Communications Toolkit, which includes a program called the WebEx Document Manager. This program functions as a standalone application or as a browser plug-in. Users must have Microsoft PowerPoint installed to enable the software."
