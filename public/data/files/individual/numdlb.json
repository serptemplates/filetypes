      "Most Super Smash Bros. Ultimate players will never encounter a NUMDLB file. However, some modders extract and edit NUMDLB files to alter characters' in-game appearances. While other Bandai Namco video games use NUMDLB files to store 3D models, those games' players do not typically extract and edit NUMDLB files. So, if you have encountered an NUMDLB file, it likely originated from Super Smash Bros. Ultimate."
