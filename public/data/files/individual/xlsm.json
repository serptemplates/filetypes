      "XLSM files are .XLSX files with macros enabled. A macro is a useful feature that functions like a script, which allows users to automate repetitive tasks. Excel comes loaded with hundreds of macros but you can also record your own macros, which consist of keystrokes and mouse clicks that execute a specific action, and edit them to make minor changes. Some examples of macro functionality include formatting data in a selected column of a spreadsheet or applying specific mathematical equations to data.",
      "If a user who has utilized macros to create an Excel spreadsheet wants to retain those macros when they re-open or share the document, they must save the document as an XLSM file. XLSM files are saved using the same Open XML-based format used by XLSX files, but XLSM files can store macros, while XLSX files cannot. When you open an unfamiliar XLSM file in Microsoft Excel, the program will typically ask whether you want to enable macros."
