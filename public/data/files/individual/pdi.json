      "Pinnacle InstantCopy was a DVD and CD copying application developed by Pinnacle Systems and released in the early 2000s. It was designed for home users who wanted to back up or duplicate DVDs and CDs, especially for personal movie collections. Pinnacle Systems eventually discontinued InstantCopy as optical media declined in popularity.",
      "The program saved disc images in the PDI format, which users could later burn to physical media or mount using compatible virtual drive software. PDI files preserved the entire structure of a DVD, including video files, menus, and chapters, making them useful for 1:1 backups."
