      "A WMF file referred to 16-bit file format at the time of its launching with Windows 3.0. The file format consists of a series of variable-length records that contain graphics drawing commands, object definitions and properties. Since WMF files are based on commands rendered to the GDI for drawing the image, it is also known as a digital recording of the image which can be played back to reproduce that image. The complete file format specifications of WMF are available online and should be referred for development of applications to work with WMF files. A WMF file is organized into a:\n\nWMF Header RecordWMF Record (s)WMF End-of-File Record",
      "WMF files originally appeared in 1988 when Microsoft released Windows 2.0. Microsoft later published the WMF file format specification with the Windows 3.0 release in 1992 and published a subsequent specification in 2006. Microsoft continues to publish updates to the format regularly.",
      "WMF is primarily used as a container for vector graphics and supports raster image data. In addition, it supports 16-bit image data that can be scaled and output at a higher definition, which is especially useful when modifying graphics in an image editor and printing high-quality images.",
      "The WMF format stores image data in a series of metafile record structures. Each of these records stores drawing commands, object definitions, and configuration settings.",
      "WMF was common in the 1990s, especially in Windows applications, such as Microsoft Word, Publisher, and PowerPoint. However, due to its 16-bit data limitation and device dependence, Microsoft replaced WMF with the Enhanced Windows Metafile (.EMF) format in 1992 when it released Windows NT 3.1.",
      "Image editors may still save vector graphics as WMF and EMF files. However, the Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG) and Encapsulated PostScript (.EPS) formats have largely replaced the formats.",
      "NOTE: Microsoft developed the .WMZ and .EMZ formats to reduce the file sizes of WMF and EMF files and make it easier to transfer the graphics between applications. These formats utilize gzip compression to compress the files."
