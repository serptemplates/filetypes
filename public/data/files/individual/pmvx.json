      "PMVX files are saved in a proprietary format and are similar to Microsoft Excel templates (.XLT or .XLTX files). They are typically opened in PlanMaker to create a PMD or PMDX file. They may also be converted to other formats in PlanMaker, including .PDF, XLT, XLTX, .XLS, .XLSX, .XLSM, .XLTM, .TMD, and .RTF.",
      "You can create a PMVX file by selecting File → Save or Save as, and then choosing the PMVX format. You can open a PMVX file by selecting File → Open and navigating to the PMVX file. You can also choose File → New and select the template from which you want to create your new document. PMVX files are saved by default in the \"Templates [version]\" folder of the \"SoftMaker\" folder in your \"Documents\" folder path.",
      "NOTE: PMVX files replaced .PMV files as the primary file type used to store templates."
