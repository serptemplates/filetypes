      "A TrueType font file is a binary file that consists of a sequence of concatenated tables. Each table is a sequence of words and has a name known as Tag. Each tag is of uint32 data type and consists of four characters. The first table in the file is font directory that gives access to other tables in the font file. Font data is contained in other tables followed after the font directory table. Since each table is accessible by its tag, the tables can appear in any order in the file.\n\nThe required tables and their tag names are shown in the following table.\n\nTagTable‘cmap’character to glyph mapping‘glyf’glyph data‘head’font header‘hhea’horizontal header‘hmtx’horizontal metrics’loca'index to location‘maxp’maximum profile’name'naming‘post’PostScript",
