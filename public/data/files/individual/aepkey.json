      "Public and private keys allow files to be encrypted so that only the complementary key can decrypt the file. For example, if you create private key A and public key B as complementary keys, only public key B can decrypt files encrypted with private key A. This helps verify the identity of the sender of the file and limits distribution to the entities that have the appropriate keys.",
