      "ROMs are acquired from cartridges, discs, or other hardware through a process called \"Dumping.\" There are various devices utilized to dump video game ROMs into a ROM file, however, dumping ROMs from other devices, like arcade games, requires more specialized tools and expertise.",
      "If the ROM file is used for emulation, it is typically used to enable older operating system (OS) software to be run on newer Windows, Mac, and Linux operating systems. Or it may be used to play video games for older consoles, such as the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) or Sega Genesis on a computer using a video game emulator.",
      "NOTE: Since ROM files are used for different purposes they may use different file formatting. Therefore, a ROM used by one program may not be compatible with another program."
