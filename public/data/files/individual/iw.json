      "Microsoft Entertainment Pack was a series of software packages that consisted primarily of simple computer games. However, Entertainment Packs 1 through 3 also included IdleWild, a screensaver program developed by Bradford Christian.",
      "IdleWild allowed users to set their screensaver as one of many included IW files. Each version of IdleWild came packaged with eight IW files, which either applied an animated effect to the user's current screen or showed an original animation, such as exploding fireworks, a twinkling star field, or a sailboat race."
