      "Movavi Video Editor is a video editing program that allows users to import videos, audio, and images and edit them together into a single video, using a timeline-based editing interface. Users can also add transitions, text, animations, and various other effects to the videos they create in Video Editor.",
      "Starting with version 23.2, Video Editor saves users' video editing projects as MEPJ files. Saving a project as a MEPJ file allows a user to open and continue editing that project in the future. After a user has finished editing their project, they can export their video in many common video formats.",
      "Notably, MEPJ files do not actually contain any of the video, audio, or images a user has imported into their project. Instead, they contain references to those files' locations. Therefore, if you move an asset you've imported into an MEPJ file, that asset will no longer be available for use in your project. (You can fix this issue by moving the imported asset back to its original location.)"
