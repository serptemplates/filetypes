      "You can create various types of artwork with openCanvas, but most users create anime with the software. When you create and save a drawing with openCanvas 6 by selecting File → New..., then selecting File → Save or Save As..., the application creates an OE6 file to store the events you performed to create the drawing. After saving the OE6 file, you can close the drawing, re-open it, which replays the recorded events, and then you can continue editing it.",
      "Previous versions of openCanvas saved event files as .WPE, .OC3, .OC4, and .OC5 files. The number represents the version of the software. However, when Portalgraphics released openCanvas 7, it replaced OC6 files with the .OCI file type."
