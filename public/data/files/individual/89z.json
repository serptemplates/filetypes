      "Students use TI-89 series graphing calculators, including the base and Titanium models, to plot functions, analyze numerical data, solve complex equations, and often, play video games. 89Z files contain a program, such as a graphing utility, drawing program, or video game, that students can install on their TI-89 calculators.",
      "Teachers sometimes distribute 89Z files to students, so students can install and use the programs they contain. Students may also download 89Z files from online TI graphing calculator program repositories, such as Cemetech.com."
