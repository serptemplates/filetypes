      "Friday Night Funkin' is a rhythm game in which players engage in rap battles against opponents. Kade Engine is a Friday Night Funkin' mod that adds additional features to the game, including the ability to automatically save replays of a player's gameplay. Whenever a player completes a level, Kade Engine produces a KADEREPLAY file that contains a record of how the player completed the level. The KADEREPLAY file describes, in human-readable text, what buttons a user pressed when."

      "You can open a KADEREPLAY file in Friday Night Funkin' with the Kade Engine mod (Windows) installed. To do so, you must hit F1 after completing a level. Kade Engine will then begin playing the replay it just created. (Because the replay feature is a beta feature, it may not always function correctly.)",
      "If necessary, you can also open a KADEREPLAY file in any text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (Mac), to view the text it contains."
