      "You're most likely to encounter CDA files in Windows File Explorer, when viewing the contents of an audio CD you've loaded via your CD drive. For these CDs (specifically, Compact Disc Digital Audio CDs), Windows automatically creates CDA files, which can be used to jump to and play specific tracks.",
      "CDA files do not contain any audio data. Instead, they contain a pointer to the location at which an audio track is stored on an audio CD. Thus, if you attempt to open a CDA file without the associated CD in your CD drive, the file will not open (and no audio will play)."

      "Despite the fact that CDA files contain no actual audio, you can open them with various media players to play the audio to which they point. Remember, however, that in order for a CDA file to play audio, you must first load the associated audio CD in your computer's CD drive.",
      "Examples of media players that can open CDA files include Microsoft Windows Media Player, VideoLAN VLC media player, and Nullsoft Winamp."
