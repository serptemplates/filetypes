      "UIWIX ransomware uses an old Windows exploit to encrypt users' files and hold them for ransom. After the ransomware finishes encrypting a user's files, it produces plain text ransom notes named _DECODE_FILES.txt. These notes contain instructions a user is supposed to follow to pay a ransom and decrypt their files. (FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files.)",
      "Files encrypted by UIWIX ransomware are appended with a series of random numbers and the .uiwix extension. For example, a file named filename.jpg may become filename.jpg._2237325398.uiwix after encryption."

      "Because they have been encrypted by ransomware, you cannot open UIWIX files. Additionally, there are no known programs that allow users to decrypt UIWIX files themselves.",
      "The best way to restore your UIWIX files to their original state is to perform a System Restore on your PC or load uninfected versions of your files from a backup."
