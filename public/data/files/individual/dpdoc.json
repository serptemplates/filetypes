      "MOTU Digital Performer is a digital audio workstation (DAW) that allows audio producers to edit, mix, record, play back, and export audio. When producers create a new project in Digital Performer, that project is saved within a DPDOC file.",
      "DPDOC files do not, themselves, contain any audio. Instead, they contain references to the audio files used in a Digital Performer project. Typically, Digital Performer imports and stores audio files referenced in DPDOC files in its Audio Files folder.",
      "DPDOC files also contain a record of the edits made to a project and the audio sequences included in that project. If you want to load the sequences contained within one DPDOC file into another Digital Performer project, you can do so by selecting File → Load from Digital Performer's menu bar. This will allow you to select a DPDOC file from which to import sequences, as well as the sequences you want to import.",
