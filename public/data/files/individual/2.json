It includes a quick synopsis of how to use the call, a detailed description of the call, sections describing the call's return values, possible errors, versions, and bugs, and a list of related manual pages.",
      "NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1, .3, .4, .5, .6, .7, and .8 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."
