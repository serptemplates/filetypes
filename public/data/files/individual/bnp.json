      "You don’t usually need to open .bnp files directly. Instead, keep them alongside the original media files in their folders to ensure compatibility with Sony software and video editing tools. Some popular ways to work with .bnp files include:\n\nSony PlayMemories Home: Sony’s proprietary software for viewing and managing media files from Sony cameras and camcorders.Video Editing Software: Applications like Adobe Premiere Pro or Final Cut Pro may recognize .bnp files if they’re in the same directory as the video files, preserving scene data.\n\nImportant Tips\n\nAvoid deleting .bnp files as they are crucial for the proper playback and organization of videos on Sony devices.If the camcorder shows errors or fails to recognize video files, missing or corrupted .bnp files could be the cause."
