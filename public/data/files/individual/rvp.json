      "You will most likely only come across the RVP file if you are updating the firmware for your Sharp Blu-ray player. The firmware comes packaged in a .ZIP archive that you can download from the Sharp website.",
      "After you download the ZIP file you can extract the RVP file and place it on a USB flash drive. The USB stick's filesystem must be FAT16 or else the Blu-ray player will not be able to read it. After placing the RVP file on the USB stick, insert it into the USB port on the Blu-ray player and follow the player's manual for applying the firmware update."
