      "Engineers and designers use DFT files to create drafts for parts or assemblies of an engineering project. The DFT format captures the technical and graphical elements of a product or component, such as specific views (like front, top, or side) and layout instructions, which is helpful for production teams and quality control in industrial settings. Designers can also share DFT files with stakeholders who need to review or produce parts based on the detailed information in the draft.",
