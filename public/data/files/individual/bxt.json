      "TTS programs allow users to convert text documents into audio versions of those documents. For example, a user could copy an essay's text into a TTS program, convert the text into a .WAV file, and then listen to the essay on their smartphone.",
      "Balabolka is a free TTS program. Users can type or paste text into Balabolka and then adjust the pitch, rate, voice, and volume with which Balabolka \"reads\" the text. They can then convert the text into an audio file, using the settings they specified.",
      "If a user wants to save the text they've entered into Balabolka, as well as their current audio settings, they can do so by saving their document as a BXT file. BXT files contain XML-formatted text that specifies a document's audio settings and content. They also contain a record of any pronunciation corrections the user has added to the document."
