      "SGY files are created by various seismic tools used to map and measure subsurface properties of the earth by sending a controlled energy signal and recording reflected waves, much like sonar devices. The SGY files can then be opened and viewed using various programs, such as Geopsy, and kogeo.",
      "The SEG-Y format evolved from the SEG format, which was originally published in 1975 and is widely used in the geophysical industry.",
      "NOTE: SEG files may also be saved as .SEGY files."
