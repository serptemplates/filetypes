      "JAM files are typically generated by a vendor-specific software program, referred to as the \"Jam Composer.\" PLD vendors then distribute JAM files to customers (device programmers), who program and test a PLD using the \"Jam Player.\" The Jam Player reads the JAM file and provides the facilities needed to program the device in a standard JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) chain. This process used to be carried out using separate command-line tools provided by Altera, but it is now encapsulated in Altera's Quartus design software.",
      "NOTE: JAM files are stored in an ASCII text format. They can be compiled into .JBC byte-code files for a binary representation."
