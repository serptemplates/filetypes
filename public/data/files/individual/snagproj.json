      "The SNAGPROJ format preserves annotations added to a screenshot as \"unflattened\" objects. This allows users to continue moving and editing those annotations in Snagit. Snagit also allows users to save annotated screenshots as .PNG, .JPG, .TIFF, .GIF, .BMP, or .PDF files, but those formats do not preserve annotations as editable objects.",
      "NOTE: Prior to Snagit 2022, Snagit for Windows saved editable captures as .SNAG files. In Snagit 2022 and later versions, both platforms' versions of Snagit began saving editable captures as .SNAGX files."
