      "MATLAB provides many tools to analyze data, develop algorithms, create models, build apps, and more. One feature is Live Code, which allows users, such as engineers and scientists, to build interactive documents, such as graphs for visualizing fluid temperature data throughout a day, or a tool for calculating heart rate from electrocardiogram data.",
