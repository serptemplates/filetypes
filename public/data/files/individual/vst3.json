      "VST3 files were introduced when the VST 3 plug-in standard was released by Steinberg in 2008. Previously, .VST files were used to store plug-ins saved in the VST and VST 2 standards. You can open VST3 files with various DAWs, such as Steinberg Cubase and Image-Line FL Studio. However, the .vst3 file extension may not be used in the Windows versions of select DAWs, such as FL Studio. Instead, the .dll file extension may be used in Windows. In these cases, you must change the .vst extension to .dll in order for the plug-in to be used.",
