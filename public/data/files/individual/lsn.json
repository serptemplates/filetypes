      "In a Finale lesson, you can add exercises (intervals, scales, arpeggios, etc.), set the Concert Key for each exercise, specify each exercise's articulation pattern, and choose one or more instruments for which Finale generates the lesson. You can also configure the lesson's appearance when printed, including the font and the size of the pages."
