      "Microsoft Plus! was a series of Windows operating system enhancement programs that accompanied Windows 95, 98, and XP. Microsoft Plus! for Kids! was released in 1997 for use with Windows 95. Plus! for Kids! was designed to be used by children ages 3 to 12, to allow them to install kid-friendly desktop themes and use additional kid-friendly Windows programs.",
      "One of the programs Plus! for Kids! included was Microsoft Play It!. Play It! was an electronic keyboard that allowed kids to create music and play sound effects. Play It! songs were saved as JBX files by default. They could also be exported as .MIDI files, though MIDI files did not save the sound effects children added to their songs."
