      "Fox Software initially developed FoxPro in the 1980s, and Microsoft later acquired the software in 1992. It started as a database management system (DBMS), then evolved into a programming language, and was widely used for building database applications, especially in the 1990s, running in a command-line environment.",
      "FoxPro users could back up window layouts as WIN files with the SAVE WINDOW command. They could then reload window settings saved in a WIN file with the RESTORE WINDOW command.",
      "NOTE: Microsoft eventually replaced FoxPro with Visual FoxPro (VFP) in the 1990s and then discontinued the software in 2007."
