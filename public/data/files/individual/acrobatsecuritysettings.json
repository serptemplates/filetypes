      "ACROBATSECURITYSETTINGS files are used to configure multiple machines with the same security settings. In addition, they help maintain security settings with Adobe Acrobat version upgrades. They can be imported and exported through Adobe Acrobat.",
      "ACROBATSECURITYSETTINGS files have advantages over .FDF files because they compile all security settings into one file instead of across many FDF files, they can be digitally signed and encrypted for security, and they can be distributed securely across a workgroup or enterprise of computers."
