      "Animators use OpenToonz to create 2D animated scenes. Originally known as Toonz, the program became open-source in 2016 and was renamed to OpenToonz.",
      "OpenToonz saves animators' scene-creation projects as TNZ files. These files are plain text files that specify a scene's settings, included assets, and animations. By default, OpenToonz saves TNZ files in its scenes directory.",
      "Notably, TNZ files do not contain a copy of the assets used in a scene. Instead, they contain references to where those assets are stored. If you move the assets a TNZ file references, or the TNZ file itself, you may have trouble opening the file in OpenToonz.",
      "NOTE: OpenToonz saves backups of users' TNZ files as TNZ.BAK files. To use these files, remove .bak from their extension."
