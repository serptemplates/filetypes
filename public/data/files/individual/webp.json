      "Google developed the WebP format with technology it acquired from On2 Technologies in 2009 to improve upon the JPEG, PNG, and GIF formats. In 2010, Google released WebP as an open format, extending it with new features, such as animation, transparency, and additional metadata support, in subsequent years.",
      "WebP features a container format based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), an open format developed by Microsoft and IBM. Additionally, lossy compression utilized in WebP is loosely based on the royalty-free VP8 video format. In contrast, a Google software engineer named Jyrki Alakuijala designed WebP's lossless compression algorithm."

      "WebP images use the compression process based on the prediction of pixels from their surrounding blocks, resulting in pixels to be used multiple times in a single file. It supports animated images and is expected to support more features in the future. Google has made available the source code online for its encoder and decoder so as to be used where required. The WebP image provides support for:\n\nLossy compression: The lossy compression is based on VP8 key frame encoding. VP8 is a video compression format created by On2 Technologies as a successor to the VP6 and VP7 formats.Lossless compression: The lossless compression format is developed by the WebP team.Transparency: 8-bit alpha channel is useful for graphical images. The Alpha channel can be used along with lossy RGB, a feature that’s currently not available with any other format.Animation: It supports true-color animated images.Metadata: It may have EXIF and XMP metadata (used by cameras, for example).Color Profile: It may have an embedded ICC profile.\n\nLossy WebP compression uses predictive coding to encode an image, the same method used by the VP8 video codec to compress keyframes in videos. Predictive coding uses the values in neighboring blocks of pixels to predict the values in a block, and then encodes only the difference.\n\nLossless WebP compression uses already seen image fragments in order to exactly reconstruct new pixels. It can also use a local palette if no interesting match is found.",
      "You can open a WEBP file with various image editors, such as Image Magick (multiplatform) and XnViewMP (multiplatform). In addition, most major web browsers support WEBP files, including Google Chrome (multiplatform), Microsoft Edge (multiplatform), and Mozilla Firefox (multiplatform).",
      "You can also open WEBP files with applications bundled with the Windows and macOS operating systems:",
      "In Windows, Microsoft Paint supports WebP images and you may also be able to open WebP images with Microsoft Photos by renaming their file extension to .jpg (this allows Photos to recognize the file as an image; it does not alter the internal formatting).",
      "In macOS, Apple Preview supports WebP images.",
      "If you are an Android, iOS, or Chrome OS user, you can open WEBP files with Google Photos. You can also upload WebP images to Google Photos to view them with the web application."
