      "You can use the 3D Object Converter to convert PRIMITIVES files to a more common format such as the .3DS or .DXF file. You can then edit the format with an application that supports the format to which you converted the PRIMITIVES file. After making your changes you can convert it back to the PRIMITIVES format with the BigWorld Primitives Exporter and load it in the game.",
