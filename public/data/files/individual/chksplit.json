      "Each checksum in a CHKSPLIT file is 40 characters long and designated for each SPLIT file that makes up your file.",
      "To create a CHKSPLIT file, drag and drop your file into the application. You can also select File → Open..., navigate to your file, and click Open. After you open your file, select \"Split,\" and choose whether you want your SPLIT files compressed. Specify the chunk size you want the file split in to (KB, MB, or GB), check the \"Checksum\" box, and click \"Finish.\" A CHKSPLIT file will appear in the same folder with your other SPLIT files.",
      "NOTE: The CHKSPLIT file appears as a compound extension. For example, if you split a .JPG file, the file appears as example.jpg.chksplit."
