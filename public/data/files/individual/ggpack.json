      "Most Thimbleweed Park gamers will not encounter GGPACK files since the files contain game resources referenced by the game and are not meant to be opened by the gamer. The resources are used for various purposes in the game, including the character and background appearance, text font, sound effects, and music.",
      "Although GGPACK files are not meant to be opened, gamers looking to modify Thimbleweed Park may find GGPACK files in the game installation directory. The r2-ggpack program, which is a collection of plugins, can be used to read and manipulate GGPACK files used by Thimbleweed Park. NGGPack can also be used to view and extract files from GGPACK archives.",
