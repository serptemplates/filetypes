      "Outwit Hub provides automators, which can be scripts, jobs, macros, queries, or scrapers, that enable you to perform different functions. A job is a preset period of time that an action should be performed. A macro is a snapshot of the configuration of the application's extractors that can be replayed with 1 click to perform a specific task. A scraper is a description of the data structure in a page, which defines the markers found in the source code that are around the data you want to extract. And queries are a list of URLs or Query Matrices on which an action can be performed.",
      "NOTE: Before version 5, Outwit Hub used the .XML file extension for automators."
