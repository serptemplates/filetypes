      "ESRI ArcGIS is a mapping and geoanalysis application that allows users to import, edit, annotate, analyze, and otherwise manipulate geographic data. To help them manipulate data, ArcGIS users can access and create toolboxes that contain a collection of related GIS tools. Advanced users can code their own toolboxes and custom tools using the Python programming language. These toolboxes are saved as PYT files.",
