      "Autodesk Inventor is a computer-aided design (CAD) application that engineers and product designers use to prototype mechanical products. These prototypes, referred to as assemblies, consist of a number of individual parts that a user has joined together. Each Inventor part is saved in its own IPT file.",
      "Inventor users can import parts from outside the program or create their own parts using Inventor's part design tools. Typically, users begin by creating a 2D drawing of a part, before transforming that drawing into a 3D model. Thus, an IPT file may contain a 2D or 3D object."
