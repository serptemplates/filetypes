      "QIZ files are generated from .TEX documents using the Exam Builder tool offered by Scientific Notebook and Scientific WorkPlace. The Exam Builder tool allows mathematics and scientific instructors to design different types of quizzes that can be taken and graded online by students.",
      "Every time a student opens a QIZ file in Scientific Notebook or WorkPlace, the questions are rearranged, meaning every time a student opens the QIZ file to take the quiz, he will encounter different questions. This allows instructors to build tests that are more challenging and dynamic than a static test that displays the same questions and answers every time it is opened."
