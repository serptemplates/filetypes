      "You can open an MBZ file and access the contents of the backup archive by uploading the file to the original course on a Moodle site. If you are an administrator on your Moodle site, click \"Site administration\" in the nav drawer, select \"Courses,\" then click \"Restore course.\" You can click \"Choose a file...\" to navigate to the MBZ file or drag and drop the file into the upload window to upload the MBZ file.",
      "Since MBZ files are simply renamed .ZIP files, you can extract the contents in the archives by renaming the .mbz file extension to .zip. Then, extract the contents using a Zip-decompression utility, such as Corel WinZip or Apple Archive Utility. After extracting the contents, change the .zip file extension back to .mbz.",
      "NOTE: MBZ files may include activities, resources, and settings, such as assignments, quizzes, and course themes. However, the archives do not store the work created or grades achieved by students."
