      "In 2011, Yann Collet released the initial version of the LZ4 data compression algorithm. Based on the LZ77 compression algorithm, LZ4 is a notably fast compression system, allowing users to compress and decompress files quickly.",
      "Over time, other contributors have helped refine the LZ4 compression algorithm, and the algorithm's use has increased. For example, Linux systems now natively support LZ4 compression and decompression, allowing users to create and extract files from LZ4 archives using lz4 and other, related command-line commands."
