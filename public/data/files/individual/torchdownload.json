      "You will encounter a TORCHDOWNLOAD file only if you use Torch to browse the Internet and download files. When you start downloading a file, Torch creates a placeholder TORCHDOWNLOAD file in your computer's Downloads folder. This file is named in one of the following ways:",
      "Some TORCHDOWNLOAD files are named Unconfirmed [set of numbers].torchdownload. For example, when you download a .DOCX file, the placeholder TORCHDOWNLOAD file might be named Unconfirmed 47128.torchdownload.",
      "Other TORCHDOWNLOAD files simply have the .torchdownload extension appended to the download's actual filename. For example, if you were to download a movie called myMovie.avi, the movie's associated TORCHDOWNLOAD file would be named myMovie.avi.torchdownload.",
      "When your download finishes, Torch will replace its TORCHDOWNLOAD file with your actual downloaded file. You will see a TORCHDOWNLOAD file in your Downloads folder only when a file is currently downloading or when a download was interrupted before completion (e.g. you closed your web browser, paused the download, or your Internet went out)."

      "In most cases, you should not need to open a TORCHDOWNLOAD file. Instead, you should either wait for your download to finish or, if your download was interrupted, resume your download. Then, Torch will replace its TORCHDOWNLOAD file with the file you began downloading.",
      "If your download was interrupted and you can't resume it, you might be able to recover a portion of the file you intended to download. To do so, delete the .torchdownload extension from your TORCHDOWNLOAD file and then attempt to open the file in an appropriate program. For example, if you began downloading a video file, delete the .torchdownload extension and then attempt to play the file in your media player. Your media player should play as much of the video as you'd managed to download."
