      "Middle school students use TI-73 series graphing calculators, including the TI-73 and TI-73 Explorer, to plot graphs, solve equations, and often, play video games. Students can install additional programs on their calculators using the devices' associated TI Connect software. Most TI-73 programs are saved as 73P files. (Some are instead saved as .73K files.)",
      "Sometimes, teachers distribute 73P files to students, so students can install them. Students can also download 73P files from online TI graphing calculator program repositories, such as Cemetech.com.",
      "NOTE: Some TI-73 programs consist of multiple 73P files. Typically, all a program's 73P files are packaged in a single folder."
