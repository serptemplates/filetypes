      "POD HD500 Edit is an application used to create presets for the POD HD500 guitar multi-effects pedal. Presets consist of FX, AMPS, Mixer, and Controllers settings. After creating one or more presets, guitarists can add them to POD HD500 set lists. They can then use POD HD500 Edit to transfer their set lists and presets to their POD HD500.",
      "While creating set lists and presets in POD HD500 Edit, guitarists can save them in a variety of file formats, including the H5B format. Saving a collection of set lists as an H5B file allows a guitarist to quickly open and edit all those set lists at once in POD HD500 Edit.",
