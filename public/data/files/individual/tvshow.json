      "mimoLive was formerly known as BoinxTV. The application is primarily used for live video streaming directly to sites such as YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch.tv and for projecting video to an external screen. It supports video from your computer, webcams, connected video cameras, and mobile devices. It comes with useful production tools that include support for multiple camera angles, graphics, keying capabilities, and social media integration. Also, nearly everything in mimoLive is customizable, which includes fonts, graphics, colors, and object positions."
