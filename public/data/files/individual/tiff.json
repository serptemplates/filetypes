      "TIFF file format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. A TIFF file begins with an 8-byte header where the bytes are number from 0 to N. The largest possible TIFF file is 2**32 bytes in length. The file begins with an 8-byte image file header that points to an image file directly (IFD). An IFD contains information about the image as well as pointers to the actual image data.",
      "Aldus Corporation released the TIFF format in the mid-1980s to be a standard image format for saving high-quality color images on multiple computer platforms. Although it was widely adopted, the JPEG format surpassed it over the years because it was more efficient and web-friendly.",
      "Now, graphic designers and professional printers typically save digital photos and graphics in the TIFF format for editing and printing purposes. They may save the images as TIFF or .TIF files.",
      "NOTE: Aldus Corporation merged with Adobe Systems in 1994."
