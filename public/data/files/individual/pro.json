      "Before developers and UI designers begin developing a website or mobile application, they first create digital mockups of what that website or app will look like. These mockups often include a number of sample screens, as well as navigation elements that allow users to navigate between the screens.",
      "PRO files are website or mobile application mockups created by Adobe Proto, a discontinued UI prototyping app that was available for tablets. PRO files were often uploaded to Adobe Creative Cloud, for use in desktop web design applications like Adobe Dreamweaver. Adobe Proto was replaced by Adobe XD."
