      "Most Unix-based operating systems include a system manual divided into eight numbered sections. The fourth section of this manual typically includes documentation related to special files and device drivers. Most notably, this section contains documentation related to device-related files found in the /​dev/​ directory. 4 files are named for the file or driver they describe.",
      "In some Unix systems, such as System V, 4 files instead contain documentation of file formats and conventions. These 4 files can still be accessed using the man utility.",
      "NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1, .2, .3, .5, .6, .7, and .8 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."
