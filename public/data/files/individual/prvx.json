      "PRVX files are saved in a proprietary format developed by SoftMaker Software. But they are similar to .POTX templates created by Microsoft PowerPoint, which is a popular slide presentation program included with Microsoft Office. PRVX files may be converted to various formats in Presentations, including .PPT, .PPTX, .PDF, .HTML, .PNG, .JPG, .TIF, .BMP, .WMV, .MP4 and .RTF.",
      "You can create a PRVX file by selecting File → Save or Save as, and then choosing the PRVX format. You can open a PRVX file by selecting File → Open and navigating to the PRVX file. You can also choose File → New and select the template from which you want to create your new document. PRVX files are saved by default in the \"Designs [version]\" folder of the \"SoftMaker\" folder in your \"Documents\" folder path.",
      "NOTE: PRVX files replaced .PRV files as the primary file type used to store templates in Presentations."
