      "By default, only MSSTYLES files that are digitally signed by Microsoft can be used with Windows XP. The Luna, Zune, Royale, Royale Noir, and Windows Embedded Standard CTP Refresh styles are all digitally signed by Microsoft. (The Royale theme is Windows XP Media Center Edition's default theme.)",
      "However, advanced users can modify Windows XP's skinning engine such that it can apply custom MSSTYLES files. For example, you can use the StyleXP program to apply custom MSSTYLE files. Programs used to apply custom MSSTYLE files are sometimes referred to as UxTheme patchers.",
      "NOTE: Later versions of Windows also use MSSTYLES files. However, these MSSTYLES files are not formatted the same as Windows XP's MSSTYLES files. Therefore, you cannot use MSSTYLES files created for later versions of Windows with Windows XP, and vice versa."
