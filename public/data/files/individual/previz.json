      "FrameForge Storyboard Studio is a Windows and Mac program that storyboard artists and other film professionals use to concept shots for movies. These 3D storyboards are referred to as previsualizations. FrameForge saves users' previsualization projects as PREVIZ files.",
      "A user can open a PREVIZ file in FrameForge to see and play the shots it contains, and edit those shots as needed. Users can also export the storyboard a PREVIZ file contains as an .HTML file, a series of images, or a slideshow.",
      "NOTE: FrameForge Storyboard Studio uses a variety of related but slightly-distinct PREVIZ file formats. For example, a macOS user can save PREVIZ files in a Mac-only file format, a cross-platform file format, or a version 2 file format."
