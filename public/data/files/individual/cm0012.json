      "If you are having trouble playing the media contained on your USB drive, and the drive contains a CM0012 file, it means you removed the drive from your media player without ejecting it. To attempt to fix this issue, you can either reconnect the drive to your media player and eject it properly, or you can reformat the drive.",
      "Before you reformat the drive, check whether you can access your media from a PC or other media player. If you can, you should copy the media to another drive before reformatting your corrupted drive. Reformatting the drive will delete all files contained on it."
