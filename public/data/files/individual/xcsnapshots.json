      "Xcode snapshots are often used to save project states when submitting software to Apple's App Store. This helps developers track reported bugs against a specific version of the source code, and it also gives them a source code checkpoint for comparison when developing new features.",
      "You can create a snapshot from an open Xcode project by choosing File → Create Snapshot... from the Xcode application menu. You can view your snapshots in the Xcode Organizer window by selecting the Projects tab. Click the Restore Snapshot button to restore a snapshot.",
      "XCSNAPSHOTS files are saved to the ~/​Library/​Developer/​Xcode/​Snapshots/​ directory. Each snapshot file is specific to an Xcode project and contains all created snapshots for that project.",
