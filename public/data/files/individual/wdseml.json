      "Users will most likely never encounter WDSEML files since they are not meant to be manually opened by users. Instead, the files are referenced by Thunderbird when a user searches for information in emails.",
      "Deleting a WDSEML file does not delete the email message in Thunderbird, it only removes the search information for the message. This makes it more difficult for a user to search for the message but the message will still exist in Thunderbird.",
