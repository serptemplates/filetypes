      "Both versions of HitFilm video editing software can be used to create and open HFP files. Typically, amateur video editors use the free HitFilm Express version, while more professional video editors utilize the commercial HitFilm Pro version that comes with more editing and visual effects capabilities.",
      "To create a new project in HitFilm, select File → New.... After modifying the project, a user can save the information in an HFP file by selecting File → Save or Save As.... After saving a project, a user can close it then reopen it later for further editing.",
      "Users can also export HitFilm projects saved in HFP files to various media formats, including .MP4, .MOV, and .AVI video, as well as a .PNG image sequence. To export a project to a different format, select File → Export Contents or Export In-Out Area.",
      "NOTE: While an HFP project file should only be opened with HitFilm video editing programs, it can also be opened with an XML editor to view the settings in XML format. However, the HFP file should not be modified with an XML editor, since the edits will most likely cause the file to become corrupt."
