      "Ensoniq EPS (Ensoniq Performance Sampler) is a digital sampler and synthesizer introduced in the late 1980s that gained popularity in the 1990s. The instrument was designed for musicians and producers, especially hip-hop, electronic, and experimental artists, allowing them to sample and manipulate sounds. Users could save their music settings as EUI files to preserve the content of an EPS sampler disk, making it easier to store or share data without using the original physical media."
