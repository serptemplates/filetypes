      "Google Drive for Desktop is a program that allows Google Drive users to back up and open their Google Drive files on Windows and Mac PCs. While Drive for Desktop stores actual backups of some types of files (such as .JPG and .DOCX files) on users' computers, it does not store copies of files created using Google Apps Script, Docs, Sheets, and other Google Workspace applications. Instead, Drive for Desktop stores shortcut files that, when double-clicked, open the associated file in the web version of the correct Google Workspace application.",
      "GSCRIPT files are Drive for Desktop shortcuts that open scripts created in Google Apps Script. These scripts are used as add-ons for other Google apps, such as Docs, Sheets, and Gmail. When a Drive for Desktop user double-clicks a GSCRIPT file, the related script opens in Google Apps Script, provided the user is signed in to a Gmail account allowed to access the script. Each GSCRIPT file is a JSON file that contains a script's URL and document ID, as well as the name of the Gmail account used to create the script.",
      "NOTE: GSCRIPT files were previously created by Backup and Sync from Google. Google replaced Backup and Sync with Drive for Desktop in October 2021."

      "If you have Google Drive for Desktop installed on your PC, or you are using a Chrome OS device, you can double-click a GSCRIPT file to open the script it references in Google Apps Script. You may have to sign in to your Gmail account or request access to the script to open it.",
      "If necessary, you can also open a GSCRIPT file in any text editor to view the URL, document ID, and Gmail account information it contains. You may want to do this, for example, if you are having trouble using your GSCRIPT file to open a script in Google Apps Script. If double-clicking your GSCRIPT file does not open a script, you can try copying and pasting your file's URL into your web browser to access your script."
