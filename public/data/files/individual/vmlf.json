      "VMLF files appear either after a failed installation of a Windows service pack or a computer crash. When the correct codec is unavailable to decompress the PMB or WMM video project files, they are converted into a folder that contains a VMLF and .VMLT file. If this occurs, open the VMLF file with the GSpot utility, which examines the file and proposes a solution for playing the file.",
