      "While Plants vs. Zombies 2 enthusiasts have developed tools that allow them to extract and edit a variety of the game's proprietary files (including .RTON, .RSB, and .PTX files), they have not yet developed any tools that can extract or edit PAM files. PAM files are also used in other PopCap Games games, such as Bookworm Adventures."
