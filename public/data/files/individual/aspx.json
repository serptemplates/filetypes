      "ASP.NET is a web application framework that developers use to create dynamic websites and webpages. For example, a web developer might use ASP.NET to create a web app that consists of several, interconnected fillable forms.",
      "Primarily, developers create and save ASP.NET webpages as ASPX files. They then place these files on web servers that support the ASP.NET framework. When a user's web browser requests the webpage an ASPX file describes, the web server first translates the markup and scripts the file contains into HTML content. The user's web browser then displays this content as it would any other HTML webpage.",
      "Typical internet users are most likely to encounter ASPX files as webpages displayed in their web browser. These ASPX files have already been translated into HTML content. While viewing one of these webpages, you can right-click and select View/Show Page Source to view the HTML version of the ASPX webpage.",
      "Some web developers may want to download the untranslated version of an ASPX file from another user's web server. (For example, to view the markup and scripts another developer used to create a webpage.) Unfortunately, unless you have login credentials for the associated web server, there is no way to download the untranslated version of an ASPX file."

    "instructions": [
      "An ASPX file is a webpage file generated by Microsoft’s ASP.NET framework. It typically contains scripts and server-side code for dynamic web pages. Here’s how you can open it based on your needs:\n\nOpening an ASPX File in a Browser\n\nIf the file is part of a hosted website:\n\nRename the file to index.aspx or something similar.Place it in a server running ASP.NET (like IIS or Visual Studio).Open it using your browser by typing the URL, e.g., http://localhost/index.aspx.\n\nViewing the Code\n\nIf you just want to see its source code:\n\nRight-click the file and choose Open With > Notepad (or any text editor).For better formatting, use code editors like:Visual Studio CodeNotepad++Sublime Text\n\nRunning ASPX Files Locally\n\nIf you want to test the file locally:\n\nSet up a web server:\n\nInstall IIS (Internet Information Services) on Windows.Use Visual Studio to run the project.\n\nConfigure the server:\n\nPlace the ASPX file in the server’s root directory.Access it via the server’s local URL.\n\nConvert ASPX to HTML\n\nIf the ASPX file represents a static webpage:\n\nOpen the file in a browser (with a server).Save the webpage as HTML:Right-click > Save As…Save it with .html extension.",
      "If you want to edit the markup and code an ASPX file contains, you should open it with Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows), Adobe Dreamweaver (Windows, Mac), or another web app development program that supports the ASPX format. These programs contain tools that make it easier to view, understand, and edit ASPX files' contents.",
      "If you just want to take a look at the text an ASPX file contains, you can open it with Microsoft Notepad (Windows), Apple TextEdit (Mac), or any other text editor. You can also drag the file to your web browser."
