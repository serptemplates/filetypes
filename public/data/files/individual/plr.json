      "In Terraria, players explore an open world, construct buildings and other structures, and battle a variety of creatures. Before players start playing, they must create a player profile. While creating this profile, they specify their character's following information:",

      "Gender and appearance",
      "Game type (Journey, Classic, Mediumcore, or Hardcore)",
