      "The 3GP video format is based on the ISO base media file format defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 – MPEG-4 Part 12. It was developed for mobile phones to reduce storage, bandwidth, and data usage. 3GP file format supports the following codecs:\n\nVideoMPEG-4 Part 2H.263MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC/H.264)AudioAMR-WBAMR-WB+AMR-NBAAC-LCHE-AAC v1HE-AAC v2 (Enhanced aacPlus)\n\nThe 3GP file format allowed the usage of H.263 and AMR codecs and defined new boxes to which the codecs refer. These code-points were registered in ISO base media file format for the storage of MPEG-4 media-specific information.",
      "3GPP is a multimedia container format based on the ISO media file format. It stores video streams as H.263 or H.264 and audio streams as AMR-WB, AMR-WB+, AMR-NB, HE-AAC v1, AAC-LC, or Enhanced aacPlus.",
      "3GP files are commonly used by 3G mobile phones that support video capture but may also be played on select 2G and 4G phones. An example of when you might encounter a 3GP video is when you are in a message thread with Android and iPhone users, and one of the users shares a recorded video with the whole thread. While 3GP files are still used, they have decreased as more efficient video formats have replaced the 3GPP format.",
      "NOTE: 3GP files may also be saved as .3GPP files."
