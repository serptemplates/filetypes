      "The Joint Bi-level Image Group (JBIG) format, also called JBIG1, was intended for compressing binary images, mainly for fax transmissions, but can also be used for other images. It was replaced by the JBIG2 specification (.JB2 files), which compresses bi-level images more efficiently.",
      "NOTE: Images saved in the JBIG format also use the more common .JBIG file extension."
