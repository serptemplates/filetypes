      "Unreal Engine is a widely used game development platform that provides developers with tools to build interactive experiences, including video games, virtual reality (VR), augmented reality (AR), and other real-time 3D applications. UNR files are specific to the early versions of Unreal Engine, including the original Unreal (1998) and Unreal Tournament (1999).",
      "As the engine evolved, Epic Games introduced new file formats and systems to handle game assets and levels. Starting with Unreal Engine 3 and continuing with versions 4 and 5 (the engine now uses more advanced formats like .UMAP for storing level data)."
