      "An HDR image file consists of the following three sections:\n\nHeader: An HDR file is identified by the first bytes in the image file i.e. “#?RADIANCE”.Resolution String: The Header is followed by a single resolution line that consists of 4 values; an X and Y label each followed by a numerical integer value. The order of the X and Y indicate rotation. The combination of X and Y with positive and negative values cover all the possible iamge orientation and rotations.Pixel Data: The pixel data of an HDR file is either uncompressed or compressed using a standard run length encoding.",
      "HDR software can composite multiple photos with different exposures to create a single image with a full and evenly distributed range of colors.",
      "NOTE: HDR files are also known as Radiance HDR or HDRI files."
