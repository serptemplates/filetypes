      "The TI-73 graphing calculator is designed to be used by middle school students. Texas Instruments released the original TI-73 in 1998; it released a follow-up model, the TI-73 Explorer, in 2003.",
      "At this point, most students use a TI-83 or TI-84 calculator in place of the TI-73. Thus, 73K files are uncommon. Developers typically write the programs 73K files contain using Texas Instruments' TI-BASIC programming language, which is a variant of BASIC."
