      "Trainz Railroad Simulator is a video game in which players simulate routing and operating trains. Developer Auran released the first version of Trainz in 2001. The game has received many sequels and is now published by N3V games.",
      "Some old versions of Trainz use 3D models saved in the IM, or Indexed Mesh, format. Current versions of Trainz also support the IM format, for the sake of backward compatibility. Players can create their own IM files using plug-ins for Autodesk 3ds Max and Blender."
