      "Unreal Engine developers create and edit UC files to control behaviors and mechanics of game elements, allowing them to add new features or customize existing ones. The developers then compile UC files into the main .U package, which the Unreal Engine uses to manage and run all defined classes within a game.",
      "NOTE: Epic Games phased out UnrealScript, beginning with Unreal Engine 4 (released in 2014). Version 4 introduced C++ as the primary scripting language to improve the workflow."
