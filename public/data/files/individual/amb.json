      "Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is a two-part video game, whose two episodes were released in 2010 and 2012. It is a 2D, side-scrolling game in which Sonic teams with Tails and Knuckles to battle Doctor Eggman and Metal Sonic.",
      "Most versions of Sonic the Hedgehog 4 Episode I and II store many of their game assets in AMB files. While most players will never encounter the games' AMB files, modders and other players interested in examining Sonic the Hedgehog 4's assets may wish to extract those assets from the games' AMB files."
