      "Most likely you will not encounter a TS4SCRIPT unless you are looking to modify game play by editing game data files or installing TS4SCRIPT files. To use TS4SCRIPT files in The Sims 4, you must first enable custom content and mods by selecting \"Other\" from the Game Options menu and checking the \"Enable Custom Content and Mods\" box. Then, you need to create a \"Mods\" folder, place your TS4SCRIPT files and any other related files in the folder, and move the folder to the following directory:",

      "Since TS4SCRIPT archives are compressed with Zip compression, you can use Zip decompression programs, such as Corel WinZip, WinRAR, 7-Zip, or Apple Archive Utility to extract the contents from the archive. To modify the TS4SCRIPT archive, rename the .ts4script file extension to .zip, decompress the archive, edit the contained files, compress the archive as a .ZIP file, then rename the .zip file extension to .ts4script."
