      "The first Plus! package was developed as Microsoft Plus! for Windows 95. The enhancement software was later created for Windows 98 and Windows XP as well. It was discontinued after the release of Microsoft Vista, which included many of the Microsoft Plus! features.",
      "The Windows 7 THEME file format includes new features that were not available in previous versions of Windows. Older versions of Windows can still read these files, but they ignore the unrecognized sections. Windows 7 also supports the newer .THEMEPACK format, which stores the THEME file as well as the image, sound, and other files referenced by the theme.",
      "NOTE: WineHQ can use THEME files to stylize the skins of Windows programs on the Linux platform."
