      "The Panasonic RAW (RW2) format is proprietary to Panasonic LUMIX cameras. Examples of Panasonic camera models that create RW2 images include Lumix DMC-FZ28, FZ1000, LX7, and TZ70.",
      "The RW2 format stores uncompressed image data the sensor on a Panasonic LUMIX digital camera captured. Since the data is uncompressed, the RW2 image is higher quality than compressed image formats, such as .JPG or .PNG. Uncompressed data also leads to significantly larger file sizes than compressed images.",
      "Typically, only photographers that utilize a Panasonic LUMIX series camera will encounter RW2 files. The photographers may be professionals or hobbyists. However, people may also download RW2 files from camera raw image-sharing websites.",
      "NOTE: Most high-end digital cameras capture images in a raw format specific to the make of the camera. Other camera raw formats include .CR3 (used by select Canon digital cameras), .ARW (used by Sony Alpha digital cameras), and .NEF (used by Nikon digital cameras)."
