      "Adobe designed the InDesign Markup Language to provide an interchangeable format for Adobe InDesign documents and a way for third-party tools to modify and assemble InDesign documents. The company introduced IDML files when it released InDesign CS4, replacing .INX files, which are more challenging to create and edit. However, InDesign still supports backward compatibility with INX files.",
