      "The JPM file format standard specifies it to be a binary container to represent a compound image by which multiple images can be combined into a single image. It sets the mechanism for grouping multiple images in a hierarchy of layout objects, pages and page collections to store JPEG 2000 and other compressed image data formats. The format includes the mechanism of incorporating metadata (often referred to as structural metadata in digital library projects).",
      "JPEG 2000 is a raster image format that was meant to improve upon and replace the .JPEG format. In part six of the document defining the JPEG 2000 format, the Joint Photographic Experts Group defined a variant of the JPEG 2000 format that could be used to store multi-page, layer-based images. This variant is often referred to as the JPEG 2000 Compound or JPM format.",
      "However, neither the JPEG 2000 nor the JPM format caught on among developers or users. Thus, JPEG 2000 (or JP2) files are uncommon, and JPM files are even more rare. For this reason, not all image viewers support the JPEG 2000 format, and even fewer support the JPM format."
