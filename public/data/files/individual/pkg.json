      "Symbian OS is a discontinued operating system used on old mobile devices, such as Palm PDAs and Nokia, Ericsson, and Motorola phones. You will most likely encounter Symbian PKG files only if you have previously or are currently developing a Symbian OS application.",
      "As part of building a Symbian application installer, Symbian developers must create a PKG file that defines many of the application's properties. When they're ready to build their installer, developers use CreateSIS's makesis command (or another SIS creation program) to load information from their PKG file and create a SIS file.",

If you cannot open your PKG file in a text editor, you likely have a different type of PKG file. Other file types, such as macOS Installers and PlayStation Store Download Packages, also use the .pkg extension."
