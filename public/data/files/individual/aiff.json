      "The EA IFF 85 sets out an overall structure for storing data in files. An EA IFF 85 file consists of a number of chunks of data. A chunk is buliding block of AIFF file consists of some header information followed by data:\n\nAn AIFF file is a collection of a number of different types of chunks. There are two general types of chunks which are important to form an AIFF file chunk:\n\nCommon Chunk: Contains important parameters describing the sampled sound, such as it’s length and sample rate.Sound Data Chunk: Contains the actual audio samples. There are many other optional chunks that list instrument parameters, define markers, store applicationspecific information, etc.",
      "In 1988, Apple developed the Audio Interchange File Format. The AIFF format is a variant of the .IFF format, which Electronic Arts (EA) developed to store assets used in video games.",
      "Unlike .MP3 files and many other common audio files, AIFF files are uncompressed. Because AIFF files' data is not compressed, AIFF files typically contain higher-quality audio than similar MP3 files. However, the files also take up more disk space since they store more data.",
      "In the 2000s, Apple iTunes and other audio applications burned AIFF files onto audio CDs. Standard CD audio AIFF files are sampled at 44.1KHz, are 16-bit, and have two channels for stereo sound. Nowadays, people primarily use AIFF files to store audio created by a digital audio workstation (DAW)."
