      "A footprint of a PCB defines the component's pads, outlines, and placement information, enabling engineers, hobbyists, and educators to ensure that electronic components fit correctly on the board and can be soldered or mounted as intended. KiCad uses the information in KICAD_MOD files to link schematic symbols (stored in .KICAD_SYM files) with their physical representations on the PCB. The separation of schematic symbols and footprints helps maintain flexibility in the design process, since the same symbol can be associated with different footprints."

      "You can open KICAD_MOD files with KiCad. Since KICAD_MOD files contain plain text, you can also open the files with text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, and Microsoft Visual Studio Code. However, opening KICAD_MOD files with a text editor will not appear the same as opening them with KiCad."
