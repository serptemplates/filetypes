      "Savage Procreate is a digital painting application designed for use on the iPad Pro. Most commonly, illustrators use the Apple Pencil to paint and draw in Procreate.",
      "Procreate contains a Brush Library that allows illustrators to select from and illustrate using a variety of brush effects. For example, an illustrator can select a sketching brush while sketching, a calligraphy brush while lettering, or a texture brush to apply a texture. Each brush effect is saved as a separate BRUSH file.",
      "To export a Procreate brush as a BRUSH file, press and hold that brush, and then drag it out of the app. You can tap other brushes at the same time, before dragging them out of the app, to export multiple brushes at the same time. You can then email or otherwise share the BRUSH file(s) with another Procreate user, to allow them to import that brush."
