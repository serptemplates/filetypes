      "In an attempt to set themselves apart from other media players, many Chinese portable media players advertise themselves as \"MP5 players.\" However, there is no real MP5 file format. The MP5 files these media players use are simply renamed MP4 files. Most MP5 files are encoded using the H.264/AVC, or MPEG-4, codec. Thus, if you change the files' extension to .mp4, you can often play them in any MP4 media player."
