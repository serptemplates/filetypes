As an audio encryption format, the content may need privacy or integrity services. As the media type does not provide such services in itself, for higher security suitable methods should be implemented in the upper protocol layers. Other security considerations, if any, have not been assessed.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nClients must ignore any received PlayReady Audio content which they do not understand or which they do not know how to render.\n\nPublished specification :\n\n\nApplications which use this media :\nApplications on clients that are part of the Microsoft PlayReady Ecosystem.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : None\n2. File extension(s) : pya\n3. Macintosh file type code : None\n4. Object Identifiers: None\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Steve DiAcetis\n2. Email : stevedia&microsoft.com\n\nIntended usage : Common\n\n\nAuthor/Change controller : stevedia&microsoft.com\n\n(file created 2008-06-03)"
