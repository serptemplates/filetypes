Events are listed as one or more comma-separated\n   elements.  Each element can be either a single integer providing\n   the value of an event code or an integer followed by a hyphen and\n   a larger integer, presenting a range of consecutive event code\n   values.  The list does not have to be sorted.  No white space is\n   allowed in the argument.  The union of all of the individual event\n   codes and event code ranges designates the complete set of event\n   numbers supported by the implementation.  If the \"events\"\n   parameter is omitted, support for events 0-15 (the DTMF tones) is\n   assumed.\n\n   The \"rate\" parameter describes the sampling rate, in Hertz.  The\n   number is written as an integer.  If omitted, the default value is\n   8000 Hz.\n\nEncoding considerations:\n\n   In the terminology defined by [8] section 4.8, this type is framed\n   and binary.\n\nSecurity considerations:\n\n   See Section 6, \"Security Considerations\", in this document.\n\nInteroperability considerations: none.\n\nPublished specification: this document.\n\nApplications which use this media:\n\n   The telephone-event audio subtype supports the transport of events\n   occurring in telephone systems over the Internet.\n\nAdditional information:\n\n   Magic number(s): N/A.\n   File extension(s): N/A.\n   Macintosh file type code(s): N/A.\n\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\n\n   Tom Taylor, taylor&nortel.com.\n   IETF AVT Working Group.\n\nIntended usage: COMMON.\n\nRestrictions on usage:\n\n   This type is defined only for transfer via RTP [5].\n\nAuthor: IETF Audio/Video Transport Working Group.\n\nChange controller:\n\n   IETF Audio/Video Transport Working Group as delegated from the\n   IESG.\n\n\n"
