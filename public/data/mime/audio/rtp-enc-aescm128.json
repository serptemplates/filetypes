An \n                 integer value between 0-127.\nrate:            The timestamp rate of this payload type, which shall be the same as that of the original \n                 payload type. This is an integer value between 1 and 2^32.\nContentID:       The OMA DRM content ID [75] used to identify the content when establishing a crypto \n                 context. The value is an RFC 3986 [60] URI, which shall be quoted using <\">. \nRightsIssuerURL: The right issuer URL as defined by OMA DRM [75]. The value is an URI in accordance \n                 with RFC 3986 [60], which shall be quoted using <\">.\nIVnonce:         The value of this parameter is the nonce that forms the IV as specified by the crypto \n                 transform, encoded using Base 64 [69]. \n\nOptional parameters:\nSelectiveEncryption: Indicates if this stream is selectively encrypted. Allowed values are 0 (false) and 1 (true). \n                     If not present, selective encryption shall not be used. Please note that unless this indicator is \n                     integrity protected, it fulfills no purpose. \n\nEncoding considerations:\nThis type is framed and binary as defined in [96].\n\nSecurity considerations:\nSee considerations raised in RTP RFC 3550 [9] and any applicable profile like RFC 3551 [10] or RFC 3711 [72]. \nFurther see 3GPP TS 26.234, Release 6, Annex K for comments on security issues.
