Other security considerations, if any, have not been assessed.\n\nInteroperability considerations:\nPlayback and authoring of this media type requires a specification-compliant DAW (digital audio workstation) or similar application capable of handling multiple audio tracks.\n\nPublished specification:\nThe PreSonus Multitrack File Format is a proprietary format with the specification available upon request from PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc.\n\nApplications which use this media:\nThe file format was developed to facilitate digital distribution of multi-track music. Multi-track stems are a common technique to deliver songs for mixing or remixing by another music producer. Stems usually combine groups of audio sources into mono or stereo sub-mixes. Instead of delivering all (sometimes hundreds of) original source tracks, stems massively reduce file sizes. Even very large projects become portable when delivered as a .multitrack file.\n\nFragment identifier considerations:\nThis media type does not support fragment identifiers.\n\nRestrictions on usage:\nThis media type is intended for use by PreSonus Audio Electronics, Inc and its business partners.\n\nProvisional registration?
