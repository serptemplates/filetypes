[RFC3640]\n   requests a repository for mode so that new values for mode\n   may be added.  We request that the value rtp-midi be\n   added to the mode repository.\n\n   In mode rtp-midi, the mpeg4-generic parameter rate is\n   a required parameter.  Rate specifies the RTP timestamp\n   clock rate.  See Sections 2.1 and 6.2 for usage details\n   of rate in mode rtp-midi.\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n   We request registration of the following parameters\n   for use in mode rtp-midi for mpeg4-generic.\n\n   Non-extensible parameters:\n\n\t  ch_anchor:    See Appendix C.2.3 for usage details.\n\t  ch_default:   See Appendix C.2.3 for usage details.\n\t  ch_never:     See Appendix C.2.3 for usage details.\n\t  cm_unused:    See Appendix C.1 for usage details.\n\t  cm_used:      See Appendix C.1 for usage details.\n\t  chanmask:     See Appendix C.6.4.3 for usage details.\n\t  cid:          See Appendix C.6.3 for usage details.\n\t  guardtime:    See Appendix C.4.2 for usage details.\n\t  inline:       See Appendix C.6.3 for usage details.\n\t  linerate:     See Appendix C.3 for usage details.\n\t  mperiod:      See Appendix C.3 for usage details.\n\t  multimode:    See Appendix C.6.1 for usage details.\n\t  musicport:    See Appendix C.5 for usage details.\n\t  octpos:       See Appendix C.3 for usage details.\n\t  rinit:        See Appendix C.6.3 for usage details.\n\t  rtp_maxptime: See Appendix C.4.1 for usage details.\n\t  rtp_ptime:    See Appendix C.4.1 for usage details.\n\t  smf_cid:      See Appendix C.6.4.2 for usage details.\n\t  smf_inline:   See Appendix C.6.4.2 for usage details.\n\t  smf_url:      See Appendix C.6.4.2 for usage details.\n\t  tsmode:       See Appendix C.3 for usage details.\n\t  url:          See Appendix C.6.3 for usage details.\n\n   Extensible parameters:\n\n\t  j_sec:        See Appendix C.2.1 for usage details.\n\t\t\t\t\tSee Section 11.2.1 for repository details.\n\t  j_update:     See Appendix C.2.2 for usage details.\n\t\t\t\t\tSee Section 11.2.1 for repository details.\n\t  render:       See Appendix C.6 for usage details.\n\t\t\t\t\tSee Section 11.2.1 for repository details.\n\t  subrender:    See Appendix C.6.2 for usage details.\n\t\t\t\t\tSee Section 11.2.1 for repository details.\n\t  smf_info:     See Appendix C.6.4.1 for usage details.\n\t\t\t\t\tSee Section 11.2.1 for repository details.\n\nEncoding considerations:\n\n   The format for this type is framed and binary.\n\nRestrictions on usage:\n\n   Only defined for real-time transfers of audio/mpeg4-generic\n   RTP streams with mode=rtp-midi.\n\nSecurity considerations:\n\n   See Section 9 of RFC 6295.\n\nInteroperability considerations:\n\n   Except for the marker bit (Section 2.1), the packet formats\n   for audio/rtp-midi and audio/mpeg4-generic (mode rtp-midi)\n   are identical.
