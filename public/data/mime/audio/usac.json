    "encoding_considerations": "Binary\nFiles are encoded binary MPEG-D Unified Speech and Audio (USAC) media packed in the MPEG-4 audio format Low Overhead Audio Transport Multiplex / Low Overhead Audio Stream (LATM/LOAS) as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3.\nFiles shall be transmitted without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping, or any other modification to the binary data.\nFiles may contain ID3v2.x frames at any LATM/LOAS frame boundary.\nFor use over the Internet, it is assumed that lower layers take care of transmission errors, so audio/usac data may include USAC frames generated without the optional cyclic redundancy check (CRC) data. Bit rate not allocated to CRC data can be allocated to audio data, thus yielding improved audio quality.\nThe USAC audio data is binary data, and must be specifically encoded for non-binary transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable when attaching to Email. Note that the MPEG audio data typically does not yield further compression when using file-based lossless compression, e.g. zip.",
    "security_considerations": "USAC is a tagged data format, and some tags are available for private use. As such, arbitrary material could potentially be transferred in the USAC stream, including executable content. Tagged data containing executable content should never be sent and must not be executed if it is received.\nNote: The requirement that such content must not be executed on receipt is especially important since situations exist where content will be generated independently and therefore could contain executable content that the sender or receiver is unaware of.\nIt is the responsibility of the decoder/player client to respect and apply appropriate file security and protection against any potential malicious content.\nUSAC is an algorithm that can drastically reduce and compress audio data and hence audio/usac objects represent compressed data. Conversely, depending on the previously applied compression factor, decoding / uncompressing this data can lead to a significant growth in data size.\naudio/usac objects are not signed or encrypted internally. External security mechanisms must be employed to ensure content confidentiality and integrity.",
