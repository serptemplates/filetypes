Valid values include:\n  8000, 11000, and 16000.  If this parameter is not present, 8000\n  sample rate is assumed.\n\nmaxptime: see RFC 3267 [7].  If this parameter is not present,\n  maxptime is assumed to be 80ms.\n\n  Note, since the performance of most speech recognizers are\n  extremely sensitive to consecutive FP losses, if the user of the\n  payload format expects a high packet loss ratio for the session,\n  it MAY consider to explicitly choose a maxptime value for the\n  session that is shorter than the default value.\n\nptime: see RFC 2327 [5].\n\nEncoding considerations: These types are defined for transfer via RTP\n  [8] as described in Section 3 of RFC 4060.\n\nSecurity considerations: See Section 5 of RFC 4060.\n\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\n  Qiaobing.Xie&motorola.com\n\nIntended usage: COMMON.  It is expected that many VoIP applications\n  (as well as mobile applications) will use this type.\n\nAuthor: Qiaobing.Xie&motorola.com\n\nChange controller: IETF Audio/Video transport working group"
