    "template_text": "(RFC 4723 published December 2006)\n\nType name: audio\n\nSubtype name: mobile-xmf\n\nRequired parameters: none\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n   revision: Mobile XMF file type revision ID\n\n      revision is the Mobile XMF file type revision ID number from\n      the XmfFileTypeRevisionID field of the XMF Meta File format\n      2.00. revision is encoded in hex in US-ASCII.\n\n   prl: Playback resource list\n\n      prl contains the playback resources included in all Content\n      Description MetaDataItems of the Mobile XMF file.  prl contains\n      two-digit hexadecimal numbers representing data bytes from the\n      Content Description Meta Data.  Each resource is listed exactly\n      once.  A playback resource contains two parts: a prefix and\n      data.  prl is a sequence of two-digit hexadecimal numbers\n      encoded in US-ASCII.  Thus, prl has an even number of\n      hexadecimal digits.\n\n      Example: If the file includes Playback Resource Lists such as\n      [00h 01h 00h 02h] and [00h 01h 00h 03h], the corresponding prl\n      is 000100020003 containing playback resources 01, 02, and 03\n      each with the prefix 00.\n\n   minimum-pr: Minimum playback requirements\n\n      minimum-pr contains the Maximum Instantaneous Resource (MIR)\n      values from the first row of all MIR Count Tables corresponding\n      to the playback resources listed in prl.  Only the largest\n      value from the values of the same resource is chosen.\n      minimum-prl is a sequence of two-digit hexadecimal numbers\n      encoded in US-ASCII.  Thus, minimum-prl has an even number of\n      hexadecimal digits.\n\n      minimum-pr requires the use of prl, and the values in\n      minimum-pr must be in the same order as the resources in prl.\n      minimum-pr is the more important of minimum-pr and total-pr,\n      because it defines the minimum playback requirements.\n\n      Example: If the file includes the first rows of MIR Count\n      Tables such as [02h 00h] and [01h 01h] corresponding to the\n      above Playback Resource Lists, the corresponding minimum-pr is\n      020001.  (02 is the largest of 2 and 1, 00 is the largest of 0,\n      and 01 is the largest of 1.)\n\n   total-pr: Total playback requirements\n\n      total-pr contains the MIR values from the last row of all MIR\n      Count Tables corresponding to the playback resources listed in\n      prl.  Only the largest value from the values of the same\n      resource is chosen.  total-pr is a sequence of two-digit\n      hexadecimal numbers encoded in US-ASCII.  Thus, total-pr has an\n      even number of hexadecimal digits.\n\n      total-pr requires the use of prl, and the values in total-pr\n      must be in the same order as the resources in prl.\n\n      Example: If the file includes the last rows of MIR Count Tables\n      such as [05h 02h] and [06h 01h] corresponding to the above\n      Playback Resource Lists, the corresponding total-pr is 060201.\n      (06 is the largest of 5 and 6, 02 is the largest of 2, and 01\n      is the largest of 1.)\n\nEncoding considerations:\n\n   mobile-xmf data is binary data and must be encoded for non-binary\n   transport; Base64 [9] is suitable for Email.\n\nSecurity considerations:\n\n   Many synthetic audio compositions have associated intellectual\n   property rights.  It is conceivable that the rights owners of\n   mobile-xmf content will want to protect their rights by applying\n   security mechanisms that prohibit the rendering of the content\n   without a legally acquired license to do so.  These mechanisms\n   would be applied externally to the Content-Type defined here;\n   mobile-xmf content itself is not encrypted internally.  mobile-xmf\n   streams do not contain executable content.
