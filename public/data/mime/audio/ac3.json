    "template_text": "(RFC 4184 published October 2005, subtype last updated October 2005)\n\no Type name:                         audio\n\no Subtype name:                      ac3\n\no Required parameters:\n\n  rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate that is equal to the audio\n\t sampling rate.  Permitted rates are 32000, 44100, and 48000.\n\no Optional parameters:\n\n  channels: From a sender, the maximum number of channels present in\n\t the AC3 stream.  From a receiver, the maximum number of output\n\t channels the receiver will deliver.  This MUST be a number\n\t between 1 and 6.  The LFE (\".1\") channel MUST be counted as one\n\t channel.  Note that the channel order used in AC-3 differs from\n\t the channel order scheme in [RFC3551].  The AC-3 channel order\n\t scheme can be found in Table 5.8 of [ATSC].\n\n  ptime: See RFC 2327 [RFC2327].\n\n  maxptime: See RFC 3267 [RFC3267].\n\no Encoding considerations:\n\n\t This media type is framed (see section 4.8 in [DRAFT-FREED])\n\t and contains binary data.\n\no Security considerations:\n\n\t See Section 6 of this document.\n\no Interoperability considerations:\n\n\t None\n\no Published specification:\n\n\t This payload format specification and see [ATSC].\n\no Applications that use this media type:\n\n\t Multichannel audio compression of audio and audio for video.\n\no Additional Information:\n\n\t Magic number(s):\n\t\t\t The first two octets of an AC-3 frame are always the\n\t\t\t synchronization word, which has the hex value 0x0B77.\n\no Person & email address to contact for further information:\n\n\t Brian Link <bdl&dolby.com>\n\t IETF AVT working group.\n\no Intended Usage:\n\n\t COMMON\n\no Restrictions on usage:\n\n\t This media type depends on RTP framing, and hence is only\n\t defined for transfer via RTP [RFC3550].  Transport within other\n\t framing protocols is not defined at this time.\n\nAuthor/Change controller:\n\n\t IETF Audio/Video Transport Working Group delegated from the\n\t IESG."
