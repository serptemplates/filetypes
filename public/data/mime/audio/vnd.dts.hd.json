The stream may exceed 6 Mbits/sec.\nprofile=LBR indicates that the stream is coded using the DTS LBR codec.\nprofile = MULTI1 indicates that the stream does not exceed 6 Mbits/sec\nand the basic presentation type should be read from btype.\nprofile=MULTI2 indicates that the stream may exceed 6 Mbits/sec and the\nbasic presentation type should be read from btype.\n\nbtype must be one of the following:\n\nDTS\nDTSHR\nDTSMA\nLBR\n\nThe parameters for these btypes are described under \"profile.\"\nFor DTS-HD audio streams consisting of a multiple audio objects\n(profile=MULTI1 or MULTI2) the btype indicates the type of base audio\nobject that all DTS-HD decoders are able to decode.\nFor DTS-HD audio streams consisting of a single audio object the\nbtype=profile.\n\nOptional parameters :\nNone\n\nEncoding considerations : binary\nThis media type may require encoding on transports not capable of handling binary.\n\nSecurity considerations :\nThis media subtype consists of audio samples; it does not contain any commands,\ncontrol sequences, executable content nor any other material the misuse of which\ncould result in a security vulnerability. No security risks are introduced by\nthis media subtype aside for those associated with any media format (for\nexample, transmission of a frame larger than the receiver can handle). This\nmedia subtype does not specify any privacy or additional integrity services;\nthus, such methods should be implemented in the upper protocol levels. Other\nsecurity considerations, if any, have not been assessed.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nNone\n\nPublished specification :\nBDA System Description Blu-ray Disc Read-Only Format Part 3 Audio Visual Basic\nSpecifications (2005-03)\nDVD Forum DVD Specifications for High Definition Video, DTS-HD Reference\nInformation (Version 1.0, 2005-08)\n\n\nApplications which use this media :\nApplications for encoding and decoding digital audio in packaged media, digital\nbroadcast and content distribution.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : None\n2. File extension(s) : .dtshd\n3. Macintosh file type code : None\n4. Object Identifiers: None\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1.
