Permissible values are 1 (mono) or 2\n\t\t\t   (stereo).  If no parameter is present, the maximum\n\t\t\t   number of channels is 2 (stereo).  Note: When set to\n\t\t\t   1, implicitly the stereo frame types cannot be used.\n\ninterleaving:   Indicates that interleaved mode SHALL\n\t\t\t   be used for the payload.  The parameter specifies\n\t\t\t   the number of transport frame slots required in a\n\t\t\t   deinterleaving buffer (including the frame that is\n\t\t\t   ready to be consumed).  Its value is equal to one\n\t\t\t   plus the maximum number of frames that precede any\n\t\t\t   frame in transmission order and follow the frame in\n\t\t\t   RTP timestamp order.  The value MUST be greater than\n\t\t\t   zero.  If this parameter is not present,\n\t\t\t   interleaved mode SHALL NOT be used.\n\nint-delay:      The minimal media time delay in RTP timestamp ticks\n\t\t\t   that is needed in the deinterleaving buffer, i.e.,\n\t\t\t   the difference in RTP timestamp ticks between the\n\t\t\t   earliest and latest audio frame present in the\n\t\t\t   deinterleaving buffer.\n\nptime:          See Section 6 in RFC 2327 [6].\n\nmaxptime:       See Section 8 in RFC 3267 [7].\n\nRestriction on Usage:\n\t\t\tThis type is only defined for transfer via RTP (STD 64).\n\nEncoding considerations:\n\t\t\tAn RTP payload according to this format is binary data\n\t\t\tand thus may need to be appropriately encoded in non-\n\t\t\tbinary environments.
