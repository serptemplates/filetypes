The same resource is listed only once. A playback resource \r\ncontains two parts: a prefix and data. If the file includes Playback Resource Lists such as \r\n[00h 01h 00h 02h] and [00h 01h 00h 03h], the corresponding prl is \"000100020003\" containing \r\nplayback resources 01, 02, and 03 with the prefix 00.\r\n\r\nminimum-pr:\r\n\r\nminimum-pr is a string containing the Maximum Instantaneous Resource (MIR) values from \r\nthe first row of all MIR Count Tables corresponding to the playback resources listed in \r\nprl. Only the largest value from the values of the same resource is chosen.

Only the largest value from the \r\nvalues of the same resource is chosen. If the file includes last rows of MIR Count Tables \r\nsuch as [05h 02h] and [06h 01h] corresponding to the above Playback Resource Lists, the \r\ncorresponding total-pr is \"060201\".
