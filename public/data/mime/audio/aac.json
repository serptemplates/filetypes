    "encoding_considerations": "Files are encoded binary MPEG-4 Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) media \n   packed in one of the following MPEG-4 audio formats:\n\n      1) Low Overhead Audio Transport Multiplex / Low Overhead Audio \n         Stream (LATM/LOAS) as defined in ISO/IEC 14496-3\n      2) Audio Data Transport Stream (ADTS) as defined in \n         ISO/IEC 14496-3\n\n   Receivers can distinguish the two by inspecting the binary data \n   stream and searching for the syncwords as listed below:\n\n      1) Syncword for LOAS AudioSyncStream() 0x2B7 (11bit sequence)\n      2) Syncword for LOAS EPAudioSyncStream() 0x4DE1 (16bit \n         sequence)\n      3) Syncword for ADTS adts_sequence() 0xFFF (12bit sequence)\n\n   The syncword should be the first bits that are received from a \n   server when requesting data identified with this mime type.\n\n   Encoded audio files packed in LATM/LOAS format should have the \n   file extension \".loas\".\n\n   Encoded audio files packed in ADTS format should have the file \n   extension \".aac\".\n\n   Files shall be transmitted without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit \n   stripping, or any other modification to the binary data.\n\n   Files may contain ID3v2.x frames at any frame boundary.\n\n   For use over the Internet, it is assumed that lower layers take \n   care of transmission errors, so audio/aac data may include frames \n   without the optional cyclic redundancy check (CRC).\n\n   The AAC audio data is binary data, and must be specifically \n   encoded for non-binary transport; the Base64 encoding is suitable \n   when attaching to Email. Note that the MPEG audio data typically \n   does not yield further compression when using file-based lossless \n   compression, e.g. zip.\n\nSecurity considerations: AAC is a tagged data format, and some tags \n   are available for private use (e.g. the Data Stream Element). As \n   such, arbitrary material could potentially be transferred in the \n   AAC stream, including executable content. Tagged data containing \n   executable content should never be sent and must not be executed \n   if it is received.\n\n   Note: The requirement that such content must not be executed on \n   receipt is especially important since situations exist where \n   content will be generated independently and therefore could \n   contain executable content that the sender or receiver is unaware \n   of. \n\n   It is the responsibility of the decoder/player client to respect \n   and apply appropriate file security and protection against any \n   potential malicious content.\n\n   AAC is an algorithm that can drastically reduce and compress audio \n   data and hence audio/aac objects represent compressed data. \n   Conversely, depending on the previously applied compression \n   factor, decoding / uncompressing this data can lead to a \n   significant growth in data size.\n\n   audio/aac objects are not signed or encrypted internally. External \n   security mechanisms must be employed to ensure content \n   confidentiality and integrity.\n\nInteroperability considerations: The AAC family of codec technologies \n   is specified in ISO/IEC 13818-7 as AAC LC Profile, in \n   ISO/IEC 14496-3 as AAC, HE-AAC and HE-AAC v2 Profiles. \n   Implementations of the AAC family of technologies have reference \n   software for reading and writing the file format and are available \n   for a variety of computer platforms.",
