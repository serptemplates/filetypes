    "template_text": "(RFC 4393 published March 2006, subtype last updated March 2006. \nRFC 6381 does not contain a registration template.)\n\n   MIME media type name:\n       audio\n   MIME subtype name:\n       3gpp2\n   Required parameters:\n       None.\n   Optional parameters:\n       Codecs. See [Bucket].  If the audio/3gpp2 body part contains\n       another container format, the Codecs parameter MUST list all\n       codecs indicated by all formats, including any contained formats.\n   Optional parameter values:\n       [3gpp2]\n   Encoding considerations:\n       This data is binary and should be transmitted in a suitable\n       encoding without CR/LF conversion, 7-bit stripping, etc.; base64\n       is a suitable encoding.  Note that this MIME type is used only\n       for files; separate types are used for real-time transfer, such\n       as for the RTP payload format for 13K vocoder speech [RFC2658].\n   Security considerations:\n       See the security considerations section in RFC 4393 (this\n       document).\n   Interoperability considerations:\n       The 3GPP2 organization has defined the specification of the media\n       format [3gpp2].  Interoperability and conformance testing is done\n       in cooperation with other bodies, including the Open Mobile\n       Alliance (OMA) <http://www.openmobilealliance.org> and the\n       International Multimedia Telecommunications Consortium (IMTC)\n       <http://www.imtc.org/>.\n   Published specification:\n       3GPP2 C.S0045, 3GPP2 C.S0050 [3gpp2]\n       3GPP2 specifications are publicly accessible at the 3GPP2 web\n       site, <http://www.3gpp2.org>.\n   Applications that use this media type:\n       Multi-media\n   Additional information:\n       The type \"audio/3gpp2\" MAY be used for files containing audio but\n       no visual presentation.  Files served under this type MUST NOT\n       contain any visual material.  (Note that 3GPP timed text is\n       visually presented and is considered visual material).\n   Magic number(s):\n       None.  However, the file-type box must occur first in the file,\n       and MUST contain a 3GPP2 brand in its compatible brands list.\n   File extension(s):\n       3g2 and 3gpp2 are both declared at <http://www.nist.gov/nics/>;\n       3g2 is preferred.\n   Macintosh file type code(s):\n       '3gp2'\n   Person & email address to contact for further information:\n       H. Garudadri, hgarudadri&qualcomm.com\n   Intended usage:\n       COMMON\n   Change controller:\n       3GPP2"
