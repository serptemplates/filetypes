    "template_text": "(RFC 3557 published July 2003, subtype last updated July 2003)\n\nMedia Type name: audio\n\nMedia subtype name: dsr-es201108\n\nRequired parameters: none\n\nOptional parameters:\n\nrate: Indicates the sample rate of the speech.  Valid values include:\n  8000, 11000, and 16000.  If this parameter is not present, 8000\n  sample rate is assumed.\n\nmaxptime: The maximum amount of media which can be encapsulated in\n  each packet, expressed as time in milliseconds.  The time shall be\n  calculated as the sum of the time the media present in the packet\n  represents.  The time SHOULD be a multiple of the frame pair size\n  (i.e., one FP <-> 20ms).\n\n  If this parameter is not present, maxptime is assumed to be 80ms.\n\n  Note, since the performance of most speech recognizers are\n  extremely sensitive to consecutive FP losses, if the user of the\n  payload format expects a high packet loss ratio for the session,\n  it MAY consider to explicitly choose a maxptime value for the\n  session that is shorter than the default value.\n\nptime: see RFC2327 [RFC2327].\n\nEncoding considerations : This type is defined for transfer via RTP\n  [RFC3550] as described in Sections 3 and 4 of RFC 3557.\n\nSecurity considerations : See Section 6 of RFC 3557.\n\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\n  Qiaobing.Xie&motorola.com\n\nIntended usage: COMMON.  It is expected that many VoIP applications\n  (as well as mobile applications) will use this type.\n\nAuthor/Change controller:\n  Qiaobing.Xie&motorola.com\n  IETF Audio/Video transport working group"
