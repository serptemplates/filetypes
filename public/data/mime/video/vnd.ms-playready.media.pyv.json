As an video encryption format, the \ncontent may need privacy or integrity services. As the media type does not provide such \nservices in itself, for higher security suitable methods should be implemented in the \nupper protocol layers. Other security considerations, if any, have not been assessed.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nClients must ignore any received PlayReady Video content which they do not understand \nor which they do not know how to render.\n\nPublished specification :\n\n\nApplications which use this media :\nApplications on clients that are part of the Microsoft PlayReady Ecosystem.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : None\n2. File extension(s) : pyv\n3. Macintosh file type code : None\n4. Object Identifiers: None\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Steve DiAcetis\n2.
