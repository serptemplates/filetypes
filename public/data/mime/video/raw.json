    "template_text": "MIME media type name: video\n\nMIME subtype name: raw\n\nRequired parameters:\n\n  rate: The RTP timestamp clock rate.  Applications using this\n  payload format SHOULD use a value of 90000.\n\n  sampling: Determines the color (sub-)sampling mode of the video\n  stream.  Currently defined values are RGB, RGBA, BGR, BGRA,\n  YCbCr-4:4:4, YCbCr-4:2:2, YCbCr-4:2:0, and YCbCr-4:1:1.  New values\n  may be registered as described in section 6.2 of RFC 4175.\n  width: Determines the number of pixels per line.  This is an\n  integer between 1 and 32767.\n\n  height: Determines the number of lines per frame.  This is an\n  integer between 1 and 32767.\n\n  depth: Determines the number of bits per sample.  This is an\n  integer with typical values including 8, 10, 12, and 16.\n\n  colorimetry: This parameter defines the set of colorimetric\n  specifications and other transfer characteristics for the video\n  source, by reference to an external specification.  Valid values\n  and their specification are:\n\n       BT601-5      ITU Recommendation BT.601-5 [601]\n       BT709-2      ITU Recommendation BT.709-2 [709]\n       SMPTE240M    SMPTE standard 240M [240]\n\n  New values may be registered as described in section 6.2 of RFC\n  4175.\n\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n  Interlace: If this OPTIONAL parameter is present, it indicates that\n  the video stream is interlaced.  If absent, progressive scan is\n  implied.\n\n  Top-field-first: If this OPTIONAL parameter is present, it\n  indicates that chrominance samples are packetized starting with the\n  first line of field 0.  Its absence implies that chrominance\n  samples are packetized starting with the first line of field 1.\n\n  chroma-position: This OPTIONAL parameter defines the position of\n  chrominance samples relative to luminance samples.  It is either a\n  single integer or a comma separated pair of integers.  Integer\n  values range from 0 to 8, as specified in Figures 6-8 of RFC 4175.\n  A single integer implies that Cb and Cr are co-sited.  A comma\n  separated pair of integers designates the locations of Cb and Cr\n  samples, respectively.  In its absence, a single value of zero is\n  assumed for color-subsampled video (chroma-position=0).\n\n  gamma: An OPTIONAL floating point gamma correction value.\n\nEncoding considerations:\n\n  Uncompressed video is only transmitted over RTP as specified in RFC\n  4175.  No file format media type has been defined to go with this\n  transmission media type at this time.\n\nSecurity considerations: See section 9 of RFC 4175.\n\nInteroperability considerations: NONE.\n\nPublished specification: RFC 4175.\n\nApplications which use this media type: Video communication.\n\nAdditional information: None\n\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\n\n  Ladan Gharai <ladan&isi.edu>\n  IETF Audio/Video Transport working group.\n\nIntended usage: COMMON\n\nAuthor: Ladan Gharai <ladan&isi.edu>\nChange controller: IETF AVT Working Group\n      delegated from the IESG"
