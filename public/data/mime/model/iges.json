(This discussion was\nraised when registration for VRML was proposed.) The IGES Project\npeople opined that at such time as the the requirements are resolved\nand new Types registered (e.g., Type CAD or Type 3D), that IGES, and\nperhaps other formats, may need to be considered for repositioning as\nsubtypes of such new Media Type. However, using the above Type/Subtype\nand IGES viewers has demonstrated the expected functionality.\n\n[]\n\n\n\n\n\n"
