USD is intended for \n   use by digital content creation software in the film and game \n   industries. As of Spring 2018, plugins are available for Houdini, \n   Maya, Katana, and Unity (by third-party repository). Applications \n   are expected to consume USD files to display the contents of the \n   file to the user, and optionally import the contents into the \n   application’s native data structures. Using USD allows \n   applications an efficient representation for scene data and \n   collaborative workflows that are otherwise difficult to achieve.\n\nFragment identifier considerations: N/A\n\nRestrictions on usage: N/A\n\nAdditional information:\n\n   1.
