The conversion is usually lossy.\n\nFragment identifier considerations:\nN/A\n\nRestrictions on usage:\nN/A\n\nAdditional information:\n\n1. Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A\n2.

Object Identifiers: N/A\n\nGeneral Comments:\nOlder files use the .pyo file extension. The extension .pyox has been introduced recently to avoid confusion with files of the Python programming environment.\n\nPerson to contact for further information:\n\n1. Name: Daniel Flassig\n2. Email: d.flassig&pytha.de\n\nIntended usage: Common\nThe format is designed to contain 3D-model information as well as data intended to facilitate production.\n\nAdoption by third parties for interchange purposes is encouraged and specification and guidance may be provided on a case-by-case basis.\n\nAuthor/Change controller: Daniel Flassig\nPYTHA Lab GmbH\nInselstrasse 3\n63741 Aschaffenburg\nGermany\nhttp://www.pytha.com\n\n"
