While a simple cube in raw WebGL would turn out hundreds of lines of Javascript and shader code, a Three.js equivalent is only a fraction of that.\n* Babylon.js - An open source 3D engine based on WebGL and Javascript\n* Microsoft is adding support for .glb files across a variety of applications including Paint 3D, View 3D and Microsoft Office\n* Blender is working on support for glTF 2.0 export including .glb export.\nThere are converters from COLLADA and OBJ, so exports from DCC tools such as 3ds Max, Maya, Modo, Poser and Blender can easily be converted to glTF. \nList of various glTF tools can be found here - https://github.com/khronosgroup/gltf#gltf-tools \n\n\nFragment identifier considerations:\nN/A\n\nRestrictions on usage:\nN/A\n\nProvisional registration?
