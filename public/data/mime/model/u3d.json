U3D \n   files cannot contain active content nor does U3D support \n   general-purpose programming language code. U3D files can contain \n   references to external data using HTTP and FTP URLs. Block \n   Metadata keys can also contain MIME data and external file \n   references as values, but interpretation of Metadata key/value \n   pairs is not defined by the U3D specification. U3D defines its own \n   platform independent domain-specific custom lossless bit encoding \n   algorithm. The encoding allows conditional reading and reading \n   data in cycles based on provided data, but infinite looping should \n   not be possible. Infinite loops are possible only by defining \n   wrong parent-child relationship in the node data, but this is \n   prohibited by the U3D spec and can be defensively coded. Many U3D \n   models can also be large and complex so protection against \n   resource exhaustion is a standard requirement. U3D files specify \n   their own file length in the Header Block, but do not contain any \n   further security or integrity controls.\n\nInteroperability considerations: The U3D specification fully defines \n   the execution architecture that facilitates optimal run-time \n   modification of geometry, continuous-level-of-detail, a \n   domain-specific compression algorithm, progressive data streaming \n   and playback, key-frame and bones-based animation, and \n   extensibility of the U3D binary block-based format and run-time. \n   The Header Block of U3D files contain Major and Minor Version \n   numbers, and optionally a Profile Identifier that identifies the \n   profile used by a file and any optional or extension features. \n   There are multiple editions of the U3D specification, but all are \n   identified by Major Version 0 (zero) with the Minor Version being \n   implementation dependent. The Profile Identifier (when present) \n   along with Block Type identifiers enumerate data blocks data and \n   extensions such that an implementation can perform all necessary \n   interoperability checks.
