The X3D specification does allow for \nscripts to execute a variety of actions including changing the URL and accessing \nlocal resources. Any implementations that execute scripts MUST give \nconsideration to their application's threat models and those of the individual \nfeatures they implement; in particular, they MUST ensure that untrusted content \nis not executed in an unprotected environment.\n\n* Active content: We are interpreting active content to mean any and all content \nthat is not static and unchanging while the designated URL is displayed. The \nintent of X3D is to provide active content to the user. This requires system \nresources in the form of memory, CPU processing, and graphics processing. Users \nof X3D desire active and are aware of the system demands.\n\n* Release of information: The X3D specification does not require any information \nbe sent from the user's computer. A particular implementation may request \ninformation and distribute it. It is up to the implementer and user to negotiate \nthe terms of service for that particular application.\n\n* Decompression issues: Several activities can occur when loading an X3D scene \nthat have security implications.\n- X3D files can embed url links for loading other resources such as images, \nscripts, movies, audio files and other X3D scenes\n- Embedded or linked scripts can be in Javascript, Java or (optionally) other \nlanguages\n- Compressed binary scenes can contain two types of decompression: \ninformation-based (.gzip, Fast Infoset) and geometric-based (produces polygonal \nstructures) which can be computationally expensive\n- Recursive techniques are not typically allowed in 3D scene constructs\n- Regular user-agent precautions used by Web browsers for HTML content should \nalso apply\n\n* External security considerations: There is nothing in the X3D specification \nthat requires or prevents security assurances. A particular implementation may \nrequest information and distribute it. It is up to the implementer and user to \nnegotiate the terms of service for that particular application.\n\nScripting is defined as being available for the specification. Two scripting \nlanguages are defined: ECMAScript and Java. Each scripting language is \ncontrolled by its local security model. As the content may run in many different \nsituations, the X3D specification does not impose specific security policies. \nFor example, some standalone applications will want to directly interact with \nthe local file system, network or database, while others that run in a web \nbrowser would use the web-browser's security model.\n\nX3D Graphics scenes can utilize the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) Security \nRecommendations [http://www.w3.org/Security/] for XML Signature \n[http://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-core/] and XML Encryption \n[http://www.w3.org/TR/xmlenc-core/], in either the .x3d (plain text) and .x3db \n(compressed binary) encodings.\n\n* Basic examples demonstrating use of the current W3C Recommendations for XML \nSignature and XML Encryption are maintained online at\n- http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/Security\n- http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/Basic/Security/X3dSecurityReadMe.html\n\nX3D security considerations are a close match to HTML. JavaScript or Java \nscripts may be linked internal to an X3D scene, or external to an X3D scene by \nan encapsulating HTML browser. Relevant informational review references follow.\n\n* HTML Mime Type Security Considerations [http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2854#section-7]\n- Excerpt: In addition, the introduction of scripting languages and interactive \ncapabilities in HTML 4.0 introduced a number of security risks associated with \nthe automatic execution of programs written by the sender but interpreted by the \nrecipient. User agents executing such scripts or programs must be extremely \ncareful to insure that untrusted software is executed in a protected environment.\n\n* HTML4 Recommendation, B.10 Notes on security [http://www.w3.org/TR/html401/appendix/notes.html#h-B.10]\n- Excerpt: Anchors, embedded images, and all other elements that contain URIs as \nparameters may cause the URI to be dereferenced in response to user input. In \nthis case, the security issues of [RFC1738 - http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1738], \nsection 6, should be considered. The widely deployed methods for submitting form \nrequests -- HTTP and SMTP -- provide little assurance of confidentiality. \nInformation providers who request sensitive information via forms -- especially \nwith the INPUT element, type=\"password\" -- should be aware and make their users \naware of the lack of confidentiality.\n\n* HTML5 security references [http://www.w3.org/Security/wiki/HTML5]\n- Details regarding specific HTML5 elements seem to be not applicable to X3D mime types\n\n\nInteroperability considerations :\n\n\nPublished specification :\nAll revisions of the X3D specification is maintained online at \nhttp://www.web3d.org/realtime-3d/specification/all The most recent specification \nis available from the ISO website (for a fee) or from Web3D Consortium (without \ncharge)\n\nISO/IEC 19776-1.2:2009 - XML Encoding\nhttp://www.web3d.org/files/specifications/19776-1/V3.3/index.html [per ISO \nrequirements, this is a frames definition page]\n\n\nApplications which use this media :\nThe applications that use (or would use) the media type (model/x3d+xml) are \nthose that display, create, edit, import, or export 3D model content using the \nX3D standard. A short list of the applications include:\n\n* Blender (Open source, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)\n* BS Contact (from Bitmanagement, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)\n* Flux (from Media Machines, runs on Windows)\n* FreeWRL (Open source, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)\n* Instant Reality (Fraunhofer, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux)\n* Octaga VS Player (from Octaga VS, runs on Windows)\n* Rawkee (Open source Maya exporter, runs in Maya)\n* Vivaty (from Vivaty, runs on Windows, Flash based)\n* X3D-Edit and X3D Validator (from Naval Postgraduate School, Java based)\n* X3DOM (Open source, runs on Windows, Macintosh, Linux, iPad)\n* Xj3D (Open source from Web3D Consortium, Java based)\n* See X3D Resources (http://www.web3d.org/x3d/content/examples/X3dResources.html) \nfor a comprehensive list of supporting applications\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : None\n2. File extension(s) : x3d\n3. Macintosh file type code : Text\n4. Object Identifiers: None\n\nThe X3D standard is a continuation of the VRML standard that is defined in \nRFC2077. As part of this work, several large modifications were made to the file \nformat and specification. The basic premise for the specification continues the \nVRML design rational. The MIME types and file extensions were changed to \nindicate this modified standard.\n\nContent Sub-types\n\nEach content type may have an additional Content-Encoding to indicate whether \nthe content has been compressed using GZIP in addition to the basic textual \nencoding. This is also indicated by modifying each file extension with the \ncharacter \"z\". For example, the plain text VRML-encoded file format would use \nthe extension \".x3dv\", and if compressed using GZIP uses the extension \".x3dvz\"\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1.
