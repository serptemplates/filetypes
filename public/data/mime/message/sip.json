If not present, the version defaults to \"2.0\".\nEncoding scheme: SIP messages consist of an 8-bit header\n   optionally followed by a binary MIME data object.  As such, SIP\n   messages must be treated as binary.  Under normal circumstances\n   SIP messages are transported over binary-capable transports, no\n   special encodings are needed.\n\nSecurity considerations: see below\n   Motivation and examples of this usage as a security mechanism\n   in concert with S/MIME are given in 23.4.\n"
