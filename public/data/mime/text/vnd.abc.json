ABC\nfiles consist of human-readable notation for musical score.  ABC files\nhave been interchanged via e-mail and WWW since 1991.  As of 1997\nthere are nearly 10000 ABC tunes on the WWW.\n\nEarly use of ABC was largely for typesetting folk melodies from the\nBritish Isles.  This quickly broadened to include folk melodies from\nmany Western cultures, and applications capable of performing audio\nplayback came into existence.  Subsequent evolution of ABC has\npermitted the notation of multiple parts, Eastern musical scales, and\nfolk dance.\n\nFurther evolution of the language capabilities is expected.  The\ndevelopers strongly favor the idea that the notation should be simple\nenough for sight-reading from the ASCII text.\n\nThere are two e-mail lists which discuss ABC.  The developers list\ndiscusses implementation strategies for new language features;\ncontact one of the persons listed above for more information.\nThe ABC User Group Mailing List discusses usage of the existing\napplications; it is described at\n\t<URL: http://diana.ecs.soton.ac.uk/~jra/abc-users/ >\n\n--\nSteve Allen          UCO/Lick Observatory       Santa Cruz, CA 95064\nsla&ucolick.org      Voice: +1 408 459 3046     http://www.ucolick.org/~sla\n\n\n\n"
