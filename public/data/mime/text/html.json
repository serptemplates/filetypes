The parameter's value must be one of the labels of the character encoding used to serialize the file.\n\nEncoding considerations : 8bit\n\n\nSecurity considerations :\nEntire novels have been written about the security considerations that apply to HTML documents. Many are listed in the published specification, to which the reader is referred for more details. Some general concerns bear mentioning here, however:\n\nHTML is scripted language, and has a large number of APIs (some of which are described in the published specification). Script can expose the user to potential risks of information leakage, credential leakage, cross-site scripting attacks, cross-site request forgeries, and a host of other problems. While the designs in this specification are intended to be safe if implemented correctly, a full implementation is a massive undertaking and, as with any software, user agents are likely to have security bugs.\n\nEven without scripting, there are specific features in HTML which, for historical reasons, are required for broad compatibility with legacy content but that expose the user to unfortunate security problems. In particular, the img element can be used in conjunction with some other features as a way to effect a port scan from the user's location on the Internet. This can expose local network topologies that the attacker would otherwise not be able to determine.\n\nHTML relies on a compartmentalization scheme sometimes known as the same-origin policy. An origin in most cases consists of all the pages served from the same host, on the same port, using the same protocol.\n\nIt is critical, therefore, to ensure that any untrusted content that forms part of a site be hosted on a different origin than any sensitive content on that site. Untrusted content can easily spoof any other page on the same origin, read data from that origin, cause scripts in that origin to execute, submit forms to and from that origin even if they are protected from cross-site request forgery attacks by unique tokens, and make use of any third-party resources exposed to or rights granted to that origin.\n\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nRules for processing both conforming and non-conforming content are \ndefined in the published specification.\n\nPublished specification :\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html\n\nApplications which use this media :\nWeb browsers, tools for processing Web content, HTML authoring tools, search engines, validators.\n\nFragment identifier considerations :\nFragment identifiers used with text/html resources either refer to the \nindicated part of the document or provide state information for in-page \nscripts. Detailed processing for fragment identifiers is defined in the \n\"Navigating to a fragment identifier\" section \n(http://www.w3.org/TR/html/browsers.html#scroll-to-fragid).\n\nRestrictions on usage :\nNo restrictions apply.\n\nProvisional registration? (standards tree only) :\nNo.\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Deprecated alias names for this type : N/A\n2. Magic number(s) : No sequence of bytes can uniquely identify an HTML document.\n3. File extension(s) : \"html\" and \"htm\" are commonly used.\n4. Macintosh file type code : TEXT\n5. Object Identifiers: N/A\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1.
