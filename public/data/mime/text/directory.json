    "template_text": "(defined in RFC2425, deprecated by RFC6350)\n\nMIME media type name: text\n\nMIME subtype name: directory\n\nRequired parameters: charset\n\nThe \"charset\" parameter is as defined in [RFC-2046] for other body\nparts.  It is used to identify the default character set used within\nthe body part.\n\nOptional parameters: profile\n\nThe \"profile\" parameter is used to convey the type(s) of entity(ies)\nto which the directory information pertains and the likely set of\ninformation associated with the entity(ies). It is intended only as a\nguide to applications interpreting the information contained within\nthe body part. It SHOULD NOT be used to exclude or require particular\npieces of information unless a profile definition specifically calls\nfor this behavior. Unless specifically forbidden by a particular\nprofile definition, a text/directory content type can contain\narbitrary attribute/value pairs.\n\nThe value of the \"profile\" parameter is defined as follows.  Profile\nnames are case insensitive (i.e., the profile name \"vCard\" is the\nsame as \"VCARD\" and \"vcard\" and \"vcArD\").\n\n      profile = x-name / iana-token\n\n      x-name = \"x-\" 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\")\n          ; Names beginning with \"x-\" or \"X-\" are\n          ; reserved for experimental use not intended for released\n          ; products, or for use in bilateral agreements.\n\n      iana-token = <a publicly-defined extension token, registered\n                     with IANA, as specified in Section 9 of this\n                     document>\n\nEncoding considerations\n\nThe default encoding is 8bit. Otherwise, as specified by the\nContent-Transfer-Encoding header field.\n\nSecurity considerations\n\nDirectory information can be public or it can be protected from\nunauthorized access by the directory service in which it resides.\nOnce the information leaves its native service, there can be no\nguarantee that the same care will be taken by all services handling\nthe information.  Furthermore, this specification defines no access\ncontrol mechanism by which information can be protected, or by which\naccess control information can be conveyed.  Note that the integrity\nand privacy of a text/directory body part can be protected by\nenclosing it within an appropriate MIME-based security mechanism.\n\nInteroperability considerations\n\nIn order to make sense of directory information, applications must\nshare a common understanding of the types of information contained\nwithin the Content-Type (the directory schema).  This schema\ninformation is not defined in this document, but rather in companion\ndocuments (e.g., [MIME-VCARD]) that follow the requirements specified\nin this document, or in bilateral agreements between communicating\nparties.\n\nPublished specification\n\nThe text/directory Content-Type contains directory information,\ntypically pertaining to a single directory entity or group of\nentities.  The content consists of one or more lines in the format\ngiven below.\n\nLine delimiting and folding\n\nIndividual lines within the MIME text/directory Content Type body are\ndelimited by the [RFC-822] line break, which is a CRLF sequence\n(ASCII decimal 13, followed by ASCII decimal 10). Long logical lines\nof text can be split into a multiple-physical-line representation\nusing the following folding technique.\n\nA logical line MAY be continued on the next physical line anywhere\nbetween two characters by inserting a CRLF immediately followed by a\nsingle white space character (space, ASCII decimal 32, or horizontal\ntab, ASCII decimal 9).  At least one character must be present on the\nfolded line. Any sequence of CRLF followed immediately by a single\nwhite space character is ignored (removed) when processing the\ncontent type.  For example the line:\n\nDESCRIPTION:This is a long description that exists on a long line.\n\nCan be represented as:\n\nDESCRIPTION:This is a long description\n  that exists on a long line.\n\nIt could also be represented as:\n\nDESCRIPTION:This is a long descrip\n tion that exists o\n n a long line.\n\nThe process of moving from this folded multiple-line representation\nof a type definition to its single line representation is called\nunfolding.  Unfolding is accomplished by regarding CRLF immediately\nfollowed by a white space character (namely HTAB ASCII decimal 9 or\nSPACE ASCII decimal 32) as equivalent to no characters at all (i.e.,\nthe CRLF and single white space character are removed).\n\nABNF content-type definition\n\nThe following ABNF uses the notation of RFC 2234, which also defines\nCRLF, WSP, DQUOTE, VCHAR, ALPHA, and DIGIT.  After the unfolding of\nany folded lines as described above, the syntax for a line of this\ncontent type is as follows:\n\ncontentline  = [group \".\"] name *(\";\" param) \":\" value CRLF\n   ; When parsing a content line, folded lines MUST first\n   ; be unfolded according to the unfolding procedure\n   ; described above.\n   ; When generating a content line, lines longer than 75\n   ; characters SHOULD be folded according to the folding\n   ; procedure described above.\n\ngroup        = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\")\n\nname         = x-name / iana-token\n\niana-token   = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\")\n   ; identifier registered with IANA\n\nx-name       = \"x-\" 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\")\n   ; Names that begin with \"x-\" or \"X-\" are\n   ; reserved for experimental use, not intended for released\n   ; products, or for use in bilateral agreements.\n\nparam        = param-name \"=\" param-value *(\",\" param-value)\n\nparam-name   = x-name / iana-token\n\nparam-value  = ptext / quoted-string\n\nptext  = *SAFE-CHAR\n\nvalue = *VALUE-CHAR\n      / valuespec      ; valuespec defined in section 5.8.4\n\nquoted-string = DQUOTE *QSAFE-CHAR DQUOTE\n\nNON-ASCII    = %x80-FF\n   ; use restricted by charset parameter\n   ; on outer MIME object (UTF-8 preferred)\n\nQSAFE-CHAR   = WSP / %x21 / %x23-7E / NON-ASCII\n   ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE\n\nSAFE-CHAR    = WSP / %x21 / %x23-2B / %x2D-39 / %x3C-7E / NON-ASCII\n   ; Any character except CTLs, DQUOTE, \";\", \":\", \",\"\n\nVALUE-CHAR   = WSP / VCHAR / NON-ASCII\n   ; any textual character\n\nA line that begins with a white space character is a continuation of\nthe previous line, as described above. The white space character and\nimmediately preceeding CRLF should be discarded when reconstructing\nthe original line. Note that this line-folding convention differs\nfrom that found in RFC 822, in that the sequence <CRLF><WSP> found\nanywhere in the content indicates a continued line and should be\nremoved.\n\nVarious type names and the format of the corresponding values are\ndefined as specified in Section 11.  Specifications MAY impose\nordering on the type constructs within a body part, though none is\nrequired by default.  The various x-name constructs are used for\nbilaterally-agreed upon type names, parameter names and parameter\nvalues, or for use in experimental settings.\n\nType names and parameter names are case insensitive (e.g., the type\nname \"fn\" is the same as \"FN\" and \"Fn\"). Parameter values MAY be case\nsensitive or case insensitive, depending on their definition.\n\nThe group construct is used to group related attributes together.\nThe group name is a syntactic convention used to indicate that all\ntype names prefaced with the same group name SHOULD be grouped\ntogether when displayed by an application. It has no other\nsignificance.  Implementations that do not understand or support\ngrouping MAY simply strip off any text before a \".\" to the left of\nthe type name and present the types and values as normal.\n\nEach attribute defined in the text/directory body MAY have multiple\nvalues, if allowed in the definition of the profile in which the\nattribute is used. The general rule for encoding multi-valued items\nis to simply create a new content line for each value (including the\ntype name).  However, it should be noted that some value types\nsupport encoding multiple values in a single content line by\nseparating the values with a comma \",\".  This approach has been taken\nfor several of the content types defined below (date, time, integer,\nfloat), for space-saving reasons.\n\nPre-defined Parameters\n\nThe following parameters and value types are defined for general use.\n\n      predefined-param = encodingparm\n                       / valuetypeparm\n                       / languageparm\n                       / contextparm\n\n      encodingparm = \"encoding\" \"=\" encodingtype\n\n      encodingtype = \"b\"       ; from RFC 2047\n                 / iana-token  ; registered as described in\n                               ; section 15 of this document\n\n      valuetypeparm = \"value\" \"=\" valuetype\n\n      valuetype = \"uri\"        ; genericurl from secion 5 of RFC 1738\n                 / \"text\"\n                 / \"date\"\n                 / \"time\"\n                 / \"date-time\" ; date time\n                 / \"integer\"\n                 / \"boolean\"\n                 / \"float\"\n                 / x-name\n                 / iana-token  ; registered as described in\n                               ; section 15 of this document\n\n      languageparm = \"language\" \"=\" Language-Tag\n          ; Language-Tag is defined in section 2 of RFC 1766\n\n      contextparm = \"context\" \"=\" context\n\n      context = x-name\n              / iana-token\n\nThe \"language\" type parameter is used to identify data in multiple\nlanguages.  There is no concept of \"default\" language, except as\nspecified by any \"Content-Language\" MIME header parameter that is\npresent.  The value of the \"language\" type parameter is a language\ntag as defined in Section 2 of [RFC-1766].\n\nThe \"context\" type parameter is used to identify a context (e.g., a\nprotocol) used in interpreting the value. This is used, for example,\nin the \"source\" type, defined below.\n\nThe \"encoding\" type parameter is used to specify an alternate\nencoding for a value.  If the value contains a CRLF, it must be\nencoded, since CRLF is used to separate lines in the content-type\nitself.  Currently, only the \"b\" encoding is supported.\n\nThe \"b\" encoding can also be useful for binary values that are mixed\nwith other text information in the body part (e.g., a certificate).\nUsing a per-value \"b\" encoding in this case leaves the other\ninformation in a more readable form. The encoded base 64 value can be\nsplit across multiple physical lines in the content type by using the\nline folding technique described above.\n\nThe Content-Transfer-Encoding header field is used to specify the\nencoding used for the body part as a whole. The \"encoding\" type\nparameter is used to specify an encoding for a particular value\n(e.g., a certificate).  In this case, the Content-Transfer-Encoding\nheader might specify \"8bit\", while the one certificate value might\nspecify an encoding of \"b\" via an \"encoding=b\" type parameter.\n\nThe Content-Transfer-Encoding and the encodings of individual types\ngiven by the \"encoding\" type parameter are independent of one\nanother.  When encoding a text/directory body part for transmission,\nindividual type encodings are performed first, then the entire body\npart is encoded according to the Content-Transfer-Encoding.  When\ndecoding a text/directory body part, the Content-Transfer-Encoding is\ndecoded first, and then any individual types with an \"encoding\" type\nparameter are decoded.\n\nThe \"value\" parameter is optional, and is used to identify the value\ntype (data type) and format of the value.  The use of these\npredefined formats is encouraged even if the value parameter is not\nexplicity used.  By defining a standard set of value types and their\nformats, existing parsing and processing code can be leveraged.\n\nIncluding the value type explicitly as part of each property provides\nan extra hint to keep parsing simple and support more generalized\napplications.  For example a search engine would not have to know the\nparticular value types for all of the items for which it is\nsearching.  Because the value type is explicit in the definition, the\nsearch engine could look for dates in any item type and provide\nresults that can still be interpreted.\n\n\nPre-defined Value Types\n\nThe format for values corresponding to the predefined valuetype\nspecifications given above are defined.\n\nvaluespec =  text-list\n           / genericurl       ; from section 5 of RFC 1738\n           / date-list\n           / time-list\n           / date-time-list\n           / boolean\n           / integer-list\n           / float-list\n           / iana-valuespec\n\ntext-list = *TEXT-LIST-CHAR *(\",\" *TEXT-LIST-CHAR)\n\nTEXT-LIST-CHAR = \"\\\\\" / \"\\,\" / \"\\n\"\n               / <any VALUE-CHAR except , or \\ or newline>\n    ; Backslashes, newlines, and commas must be encoded.\n    ; \\n or \\N can be used to encode a newline.\n\ndate-list = date *(\",\" date)\n\ntime-list = time *(\",\" time)\n\ndate-time-list = date \"T\" time *(\",\" date \"T\" time)\n\nboolean = \"TRUE\" / \"FALSE\"\n\ninteger-list = integer *(\",\" integer)\n\ninteger = [sign] 1*DIGIT\n\nfloat-list = float *(\",\" float)\n\nfloat = [sign] 1*DIGIT [\".\" 1*DIGIT]\n\nsign = \"+\" / \"-\"\n\ndate = date-fullyear [\"-\"] date-month [\"-\"] date-mday\n\ndate-fullyear = 4 DIGIT\n\ndate-month = 2 DIGIT     ;01-12\n\ndate-mday = 2 DIGIT      ;01-28, 01-29, 01-30, 01-31\n                         ;based on month/year\n\ntime = time-hour [\":\"] time-minute [\":\"] time-second [time-secfrac]\n        [time-zone]\n\ntime-hour = 2 DIGIT      ;00-23\n\ntime-minute = 2 DIGIT    ;00-59\n\ntime-second = 2 DIGIT    ;00-60 (leap second)\n\ntime-secfrac = \",\" 1*DIGIT\n\ntime-zone = \"Z\" / time-numzone\n\ntime-numzome = sign time-hour [\":\"] time-minute\n\niana-valuespec = <a publicly-defined valuetype format, registered\n                  with IANA, as defined in section 15 of this\n                  document>\n\nSome specific notes on the value types and formats:\n\n\"text\": The \"text\" value type should be used to identify values that\ncontain human-readable text. The character set and language in which\nthe text is represented is controlled by the charset content-header\nand the language type parameter and content-header.\n\n      Examples for \"text\":\n                 this is a text value\n                 this is one value,this is another\n                 this is a single value\\, with a comma encoded\n\nA formatted text line break in a text value type MUST be represented\nas the character sequence backslash (ASCII decimal 92) followed by a\nLatin small letter n (ASCII decimal 110) or a Latin capital letter N\n(ASCII decimal 78), that is \"\\n\" or \"\\N\".\n\nFor example a multiple line DESCRIPTION value of:\n\nMythical Manager\nHyjinx Software Division\nBabsCo, Inc.\n\ncould be represented as:\n\nDESCRIPTION:Mythical Manager\\nHyjinx Software Division\\n\n BabsCo\\, Inc.\\n\n\ndemonstrating the \\n literal formatted line break technique, the\nCRLF-followed-by-space line folding technique, and the backslash\nescape technique.\n\n\"uri\": The \"uri\" value type should be used to identify values that\nare referenced by a URI (including a Content-ID URI), instead of\nencoded in-line. These value references might be used if the value is\ntoo large, or otherwise undesirable to include directly. The format\nfor the URI is as defined in RFC 1738.\n\n    Examples for \"uri\":\n               http://www.foobar.com/my/picture.jpg\n               ldap://ldap.foobar.com/cn=babs%20jensen\n\n\"date\", \"time\", and \"date-time\": Each of these value types is based\non a subset of the definitions in ISO 8601 standard. Profiles MAY\nplace further restrictions on \"date\" and \"time\" values.  Multiple\n\"date\" and \"time\" values can be specified using the comma-separated\nnotation, unless restricted by a profile.\n\n    Examples for \"date\":\n                1985-04-12\n                1996-08-05,1996-11-11\n                19850412\n\n    Examples for \"time\":\n                10:22:00\n                102200\n                10:22:00.33\n                10:22:00.33Z\n                10:22:33,11:22:00\n                10:22:00-08:00\n\n    Examples for \"date-time\":\n                1996-10-22T14:00:00Z\n                1996-08-11T12:34:56Z\n                19960811T123456Z\n                1996-10-22T14:00:00Z,1996-08-11T12:34:56Z\n\n\"boolean\": The \"boolean\" value type is used to express boolen values.\nThese values are case insensitive.\n\n    Examples: TRUE\n              false\n              True\n\n\"integer\": The \"integer\" value type is used to express signed\nintegers in decimal format. If sign is not specified, the value is\nassumed positive \"+\". Multiple \"integer\" values can be specified\nusing the comma-separated notation, unless restricted by a profile.\n\n    Examples: 1234567890\n              -1234556790\n              +1234556790,432109876\n\n\"float\": The \"float\" value type is used to express real numbers.
