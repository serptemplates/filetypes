    "template_text": "(per RFC5545)\n\nType name:  text\n\nSubtype name:  calendar\n\nRequired parameters:  none\n\nOptional parameters:  charset, method, component, and optinfo\n\n   The \"charset\" parameter is defined in [RFC2046] for subtypes of\n   the \"text\" media type.  It is used to indicate the charset used in\n   the body part.  The charset supported by this revision of\n   iCalendar is UTF-8.  The use of any other charset is deprecated by\n   this revision of iCalendar; however, note that this revision\n   requires that compliant applications MUST accept iCalendar streams\n   using either the UTF-8 or US-ASCII charset.\n\n   The \"method\" parameter is used to convey the iCalendar object\n   method or transaction semantics for the calendaring and scheduling\n   information.  It also is an identifier for the restricted set of\n   properties and values of which the iCalendar object consists.  The\n   parameter is to be used as a guide for applications interpreting\n   the information contained within the body part.  It SHOULD NOT be\n   used to exclude or require particular pieces of information unless\n   the identified method definition specifically calls for this\n   behavior.  Unless specifically forbidden by a particular method\n   definition, a text/calendar content type can contain any set of\n   properties permitted by the Calendaring and Scheduling Core Object\n   Specification.  The \"method\" parameter MUST be specified and MUST\n   be set to the same value as the \"METHOD\" component property of the\n   iCalendar objects of the iCalendar stream if and only if the\n   iCalendar objects in the iCalendar stream all have a \"METHOD\"\n   component property set to the same value.\n\n   The value for the \"method\" parameter is defined as follows:\n\n    method  = 1*(ALPHA / DIGIT / \"-\")\n    ; IANA-registered iCalendar object method\n\n   The \"component\" parameter conveys the type of iCalendar calendar\n   component within the body part.  If the iCalendar object contains\n   more than one calendar component type, then multiple component\n   parameters MUST be specified.\n\n   The value for the \"component\" parameter is defined as follows:\n\n    component = \"VEVENT\"\n              / \"VTODO\"\n              / \"VJOURNAL\"\n              / \"VFREEBUSY\"\n              / \"VTIMEZONE\"\n              / iana-token\n              / x-name\n\n   The \"optinfo\" parameter conveys optional information about the\n   iCalendar object within the body part.  This parameter can only\n   specify semantics already specified by the iCalendar object and\n   that can be otherwise determined by parsing the body part.  In\n   addition, the optional information specified by this parameter\n   MUST be consistent with that information specified by the\n   iCalendar object.  For example, it can be used to convey the\n   \"Attendee\" response status to a meeting request.  The parameter\n   value consists of a string value.\n\n   The parameter can be specified multiple times.\n\n   The value for the \"optinfo\" parameter is defined as follows:\n\n    optinfo    = infovalue / qinfovalue\n\n    infovalue  = iana-token / x-name\n\n    qinfovalue = DQUOTE (infovalue) DQUOTE\n\nEncoding considerations:  This media type can contain 8bit\n   characters, so the use of quoted-printable or base64 MIME Content-\n   Transfer-Encodings might be necessary when iCalendar objects are\n   transferred across protocols restricted to the 7bit repertoire.\n   Note that a text valued property in the content entity can also\n   have content encoding of special characters using a BACKSLASH\n   character escapement technique.  This means that content values\n   can end up being encoded twice.\n\nSecurity considerations:  See Section 7.\n\nInteroperability considerations:  This media type is intended to\n   define a common format for conveying calendaring and scheduling\n   information between different systems.
