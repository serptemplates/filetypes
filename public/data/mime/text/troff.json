File names are orthogonal to\n      the nature of the content.  In particular, while a file name or\n      a component of a name may be useful in some types of automated\n      processing of files, the name or component might not be capable\n      of indicating subtleties such as proportion of textual (as\n      opposed to image or formatting directive) content.  This media\n      type SHOULD NOT be assigned a relationship with any file\n      \"extension\" where content may be untrusted unless there is\n      provision for human judgment that may be used to override that\n      relationship for individual files.  Where appropriate, a file\n      name MAY be suggested by a suitable mechanism such as the one\n      specified in [I17.RFC2183] as amended by [N5.RFC2231] and\n      [N6.Errata].\n\n   Macintosh File Type Code(s): unknown\n\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\n   Bruce Lilly\n   blilly&erols.com\n\nIntended usage: COMMON\n\nAuthor/Change controller: IESG\n\nConsistency: The media has provision for comments; these are\n   sometimes used to convey recommended processing commands, to\n   indicate required resources, etc.  To avoid confusing recipients,\n   senders SHOULD ensure that information specified in optional\n   parameters is consistent with any related information that may be\n   contained within the media content.\n"
