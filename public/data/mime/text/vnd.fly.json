There are no\nline length limitations as we do not parse the file line by line.\n\nSecurity considerations : \nfly files are normally parsed at the server level.  so the security is very\nsmiliar to that of html and other text types.  text/vnd.fly files do usually\ninteract w/ a database, so you have to make sure that the user supplied data\nis correct, but this is something that you normally need to do.\n\nAll parsed files are pulled from the local filesystem, so there is not\na problem of a user suppling data that gets parsed unless you let the\nuser modify your pages.\n\nInteroperability considerations : \nnone, the files are platform independant\n\nPublished specification : \npublication at http://www.flyidea.com will coincide with release of product\n\nApplications which use this media : \nmod_fly for the web daemon module and fly.cgi for the cgi version\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : \n2. File extension(s) : fly\n3. Macintosh file type code : \ntext/vnd.fly is a text file markup that gets translated to produce output\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : John-Mark Gurney\n2. E-mail : jmg&flyidea.com\n\nIntended usage : Common \nassociate fly extensions with our cgi/module so that apache called the\nproper handler for it...\n\nAuthor/Change controller : Fly Idea, Inc. is the producer of the\nproduct and will have ultimate control of changes, John-Mark is just a\ncontact person.  \n\n\n\n"
