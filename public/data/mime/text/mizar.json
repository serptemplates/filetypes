The value is a string such as \"7.12.01\" (which is the current version of the Mizar language and tool suite at the time of submitting this application).\r\n\r\nEncoding considerations : 7bit\r\n\r\n\r\nSecurity considerations :\r\nNone.\r\n\r\nInteroperability considerations :\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished specification :\r\nThe language is documented at http://mizar.org/language .

Email : j.alama&fct.unl.pt\r\n\r\nIntended usage : Common\r\nThe mizar language is a language for formalized mathematical documents.\r\nAuthors use this langauge to express definitions of mathematical\r\nconcepts, and express and proof formal mathematical statements. The\r\nlanguage has been developed since the 1970s and today is used in\r\nteaching logic and mathematics in various high school and universty\r\nsettings. The library of mathematical knowledge formalized in the mizar\r\nlanguage, the Mizar Mathematical Library, consists (at the time of\r\napplication) of more than 1100 \"articles\" which, like an ordinary\r\nmathematical article in a journal, are coherent presentations and\r\ndevelopments of mathematics. Mizar texts are intended to be used by plain text editors.\r\n\r\nAuthor/Change controller : Association of Mizar Users (SUM)\r\nsum&mizar.uwb.edu.pl"
