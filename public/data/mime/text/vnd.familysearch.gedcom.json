The parameter is \n      not used when payload is present because the charset \n      information is transported inside the payload. However, should \n      charset negotiation be needed, and no Accept-Charset header or \n      equivalent is supported, it may be used in a media range used \n      in a request, such as in an Accept header.\n\n      Many earlier versions of GEDCOM specified an \"ANSEL\" character \n      set, which does not have an assignment in the IANA Character \n      Sets registry and so cannot be used by either the charset \n      parameter or Accept-Charset. Since UTF-16 support was added in \n      1993, UTF-8 has been supported in GEDCOM since 1999, and the \n      latest version of GEDCOM only supports UTF-8, it is not \n      expected that ANSEL would need to be requested.\n\n   version: The GEDCOM specification version. The parameter is not \n      used when payload is present because the version information is \n      transported inside the payload. However, should version \n      negotiation be needed, it may be used in a media range used in \n      a request, such as in an Accept header. The version parameter \n      uses the Semantic Versioning 2.0 (https://semver.org/) syntax.\n\nEncoding considerations: Text in a specified character set. Some \n   earlier versions of GEDCOM permitted UTF-16 to be used, but UTF-16 \n   cannot be used with a \"text/*\" media type.
