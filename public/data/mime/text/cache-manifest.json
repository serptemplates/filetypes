The parameter's value must be\n\"utf-8\". This parameter serves no purpose; it is only allowed for\ncompatibility with legacy servers.\n\nEncoding considerations : 8bit\n\nSecurity considerations :\n\nCache manifests themselves contain no executable content and pose no \nimmediate risk unless sensitive information is included within the manifest.\n\nImplementations however, are required to follow specific rules when \npopulating a cache based on a cache manifest, to ensure that certain \norigin-based restrictions are honoured. Failure to correctly implement \nthese rules can result in information leakage, cross-site scripting \nattacks, and the like.\n\nCaching mechanisms are typically subjects of poisoning attacks and the \none that this file type supports is no exception. The published \nspecification includes steps intended to mitigate such issues (notably \nnon-malicious cache poisoning from captive portals) but implementers are \nadvised to exercise caution in caching.\n\nAdditionally, the permanence of this caching mechanism requires care to \nbe taken with respect to users' privacy \n(http://www.w3.org/TR/html/single-page.html#expiring-application-caches) \nand storage resources \n(http://www.w3.org/TR/html/single-page.html#disk-space).\n\nInteroperability considerations :\n\nRules for generating and processing text/cache-manifest payloads are\ndefined in the HTML specification.\n\nPublished specification :\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html is the relevant specification.\n\nApplications which use this media :\nWeb browsers.\n\nFragment identifier considerations :\nFragment identifiers have no meaning with the text/cache-manifest type.\n\nRestrictions on usage :\nNo restrictions apply.\n\nProvisional registration? (standards tree only) :\nNo.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Deprecated alias names for this type : N/A\n2. Magic number(s) : \"CACHE MANIFEST\" followed by [ \\t\\r\\n]\n3. File extension(s) : \"appcache\", \"manifest\"\n4. Macintosh file type code : No specific Macintosh file type codes are\nrecommended.\n5. Object Identifiers: N/A\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Robin Berjon\n2. Email : robin&w3.org\n\nIntended usage : Common\nN/A\n\nAuthor/Change controller : Author/Change controller : Author:\nIan Hickson <ian&hixie.ch>\n\nChange controller:\nW3C"
