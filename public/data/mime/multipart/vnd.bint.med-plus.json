Subsequent documents derived from the\ncontents of the multipart/vnd.bint.med-plus container shall be based on the\nfirst part only, and will not be placed inside a multipart/vnd.bint.med-plus\ncontainer.\n\nA processor, able to handle the second body part, shall use it as \nprimary data source and must be able to reproduce a consistent first \npart, when creating an updated multipart/vnd.bint.med-plus document.\n\nThe parts are two alternative representations (syntax) of the data, \nwith the same semantics, which can be processed each to a different \nextent by different processors.\n\n- one more generically to be handled, primarily for display and robust\ndocumentation purpose, handled by widely spread processors\n\n- one more structured for automatic processing but generally not known\nby common processors\n\nSecurity considerations:\nThe security issues associated with this type have not been assessed.\n\nInteroperability considerations:\nNo interoperability issues known or expected.\n\nPublished specification:\nN/A\n\nApplications which use this media:\nBINTmed Affinity Domain\n\nFragment identifier considerations:\nN/A\n\nRestrictions on usage:\nNone known yet.\nThought to be used in the BINTmed Context only.\n\nProvisional registration?
