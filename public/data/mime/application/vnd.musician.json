This will create\n  a default file of the type \"application/vnd.musician\" \n  with the default name \"score.mus\". \n       \nComments:\n\n  The Media subtype \"musician\" derives its name from\n  the MUSICIAN language/encoding conceived and developed\n  by RenaiScience Corporation.  MUSICIAN is an acronym\n  standing for \"MUsical Score Interpreted Code Invented\n  for the ASCII designation of Notation\". Files of\n  the type \"application/musician\" are always denoted by\n  the \".mus\" file extension, and contain MUSICIAN code\n  as a part of their content. These files will be \n  viewable via the MUSICIAN plugin for the Netscape,\n  Explorer, and other plugin-capable browsers.              \n       \n\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\n\n  Robert G. Adams\n  (gadams&renaiscience.com)\n  RenaiScience Corporation\n  2371 Caringa Way, Suite D\n  Carlsbad, CA 92009        \n\n==================================================================\n\n\n\n"
