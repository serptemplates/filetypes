(RFC 2376)\n\nSecurity considerations : \nXFDL (Extensible Forms Description Language) is an XML-based language\ndesigned to represent complex business forms on the Web. XFDL includes\nsupport for multiple overlapping digital signatures, and auditable\ntransaction records. We believe that XFDL can provide full\nnon-repudiation of contractual forms.\n\nProtecting the privacy of an XFDL document during transmission is done\nusing common http encrytion techniques. Some thought has been given to\nproviding a built-in system on encryption to protect the privacy of\nXFDL document while they reside in a file system, but no such system\nexists at this time.\n\nInteroperability considerations : \nXFDL was designed to be a cross-platform language.\n\nPublished specification : \nThe full XFDL specification can be found at:\nhttp://www.w3.org/Submission/1998/16\nor\nhttp://www.uwi.com/xfdl\n\nApplications which use this media : \nUWI.Com's InternetForms viewer, designer and gateway products.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1.

E-mail : Manning\n\nIntended usage : Common \nWe encourage the common use of XFDL. It has been submitted to the W3C.\n\nAuthor/Change controller : Dave Manning, CTO - UWI.Com\ndmanning&uwi.com \n\n\n"
