The MIPC standard is implemented in the Hierarchical Data Format, version 5 (HDF5) as the file container. MIPC defines a more general point cloud than point clouds from particular phenomenologies such as Sensor Independent Point Cloud (SIPC) standard for LIDAR. The MIPC FFDD describes the conventions, methods, and processes for storing and extracting geospatial point cloud information based on the MIPC standard for data and metadata content established by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA).\n\nMIPC is designed to solve the problems of the current point cloud formats such as LAS, BPF, and FXYZ. The MIPC standard provides an efficient data structure for point clouds that supports internal tiling of large collections of points within the file to accommodate any spatial acceleration structure, such as octrees and quadtrees, or even simple spatial tiling. These tiling strategies speed up search of relevant points for a given Area of Interest (AOI). The data structure also supports the inclusion or fusion of point cloud data from multiple sensors and modalities over the same scene. MIPC also standardizes a rich collection of metadata in a hierarchical structure to reduce redundancy of information, and to provide information in the proper location within the file. MIPC mandates HDF5 as the file format container. This format is already used heavily within the scientific data community and has an established Application Programming Interface (API) that greatly reduces development effort and risk for tools that write and read this type of data. The format supports the storage of additional auxiliary data, such as images, DEM, extracted features, shapes, text, tables, signatures, etc.\n\nFragment identifier considerations:\nN/A\n\nRestrictions on usage:\nThe MIPC standard is intended to be a US Government standard open to the public. There are no ITAR (International Traffic in Arms Regulations) specific data within the MIPC specification. There are no patents associated with the specification. Copyrights belong to the US Government to the extent they do for any other standard specification published in this manner. There is no cost for accessing this standard, and there is no use license.\n\nAdditional Information:\n\n   Magic number:\n   To first verify that the file is HDF5 formatted, the data consumer \n   must search for the HDF5 superblock.
