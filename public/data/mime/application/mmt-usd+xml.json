Both integrity protection and source authentication is recommended to prevent misleading of processors. This type does not employ executable content, but since it is explicitly extensible then executable content could appear in an extension. This media type does not provide any confidentiality protection and instead relies on the transport protocol that carries it to provide such security, if needed.\n\nInteroperability considerations: The published specification describes processing semantics that dictate behavior that must be followed when dealing with, among other things, unrecognized elements and attributes, both in the document's namespace and in other namespaces. Because this is extensible, conformant processors may expect (and enforce) that content received is well-formed XML, but it cannot be guaranteed that the content is valid to a particular DTD or Schema or that the processor will recognize all of the elements and attributes in the document.\n\nPublished specification: This media type registration is an integral part of ATSC A/331, \"Signaling, Delivery, Synchronization, and Error Protection\", Annex H.
