The DCD is only delivery\nenabler, rendering the content is the responsibility of the Application.\nApplication can be any type of application that consume content - i.e.\nbrowser, ticker, music download, navigation and etc' - for the DCD\nenabler the content is opaque, the enabler know nothing about the\ncontent, it knows to which application it should be delivered base on\npredefine Application-ID.\nSo DCD is the container application/vnd.oma.dcd or\napplication/vnd.oma.dcdc is the packaging encoding of the format - the\ncontainer contain the DCD metadata and other type of content that has\nits own media-type.\nSo for summery the DCD is a sophisticated delivery pipe managed by\nmetadata - security consideration should be taken by the application\nthat runs the content and not by the enabler since the enabler, by\ndefinition, knows nothing about the content.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nNo interoperabilty issues identified\n\nPublished specification :\nOMA DCD 1.0 Enabler Specification.\nAvailable from http://www.openmobilealliance.org\n\nApplications which use this media :\nOMA DCD Client and OMA DCD Server as part of OMA-DCD 1.0 specification (DCD -\nDynamic Content Delivery).\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : none\n2. File extension(s) : none\n3. Macintosh file type code : none\n4. Object Identifiers: none\n\nThe data is Dynamic Content Delivery in Wireless Binary XML (WBXML)\nformat. The WBXML specification is available at\nhttp://www.openmobilealliance.org.\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Avi Primo\n2. Email : aprimo&celltick.com\n\nIntended usage : Limited Use\nThis MIME media type is registered for use with the OMA DCD Enaler.\n\n\nAuthor/Change controller : OMNA - Open Mobile Naming Authority,\nOMA-OMNA&mail.openmobilealliance.org \n\n(file created 2008-04-28)"
