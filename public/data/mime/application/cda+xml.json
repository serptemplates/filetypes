HL7 provides \n   a standardized way of exchanging requirements for restrictions as \n   well as identifying the data affected by privacy law and \n   confidentiality rules. HL7 has developed the HL7 Healthcare \n   Privacy and Security Classification System (HCS), Release 1\n   (see: http://www.hl7.org/implement/standards/product_brief.cfm?product_id=345) \n   which can be used in several v2 segments.

Additionally, HL7 \n   messages in this format can be digitally signed using externalized \n   mechanisms that don't need to be embedded within the artifact.\n\n   As an XML-based type, this media type inherits the security \n   considerations of XML -- see RFC 7303 section 10.\n\nInteroperability considerations: HL7 Version 3 Clinical Document \n   Architecture (CDA®) is designed to enable clinical information \n   exchange between providers and patients within the healthcare \n   domain. CDA is a document markup standard that specifies the \n   structure and semantics of \"clinical documents\" for the purpose of \n   exchange between healthcare providers and patients. It defines a \n   clinical document as having the following six characteristics: 1) \n   Persistence, 2) Stewardship, 3) Potential for authentication, 4) \n   Context, 5) Wholeness and 6) Human readability. A CDA can contain \n   any type of clinical content -- typical CDA documents would be a \n   Discharge Summary, Imaging Report, Admission & Physical, Pathology \n   Report and more. The most popular use is for inter-enterprise \n   information exchange, such as is envisioned for a US Health \n   Information Exchange (HIE). Currently, over 150,000,000 documents \n   using the CDA format are exchanged each month.",
