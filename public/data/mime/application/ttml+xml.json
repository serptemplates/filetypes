See also Encoding Considerations below.\n\nprofile\nThe document profile of a TTMLDocument Instance may be specified using an optional profile parameter, which, if specified, the value of which must adhere to the syntax and semantics of ttp:profile parameter defined by TTML 1.0 Second Edition, Section 6.2.8 ttp:profile of the published specification.\n\ncodecs\nThe optional codecs parameter provides a short form version of the profile paramater with multiple-profile combinatorial capability. If a short (4-character) form of a profile is registered in the TTML Profile Registry, it is recommended that this codecs parameter be used and not the profile parameter. The nominal value of this parameter is a single 4 character code from the registry.\nAdditionally, applications using the entries in the registry are encouraged to adopt the following combination syntax:\nEmploy two combination operators, '+' (AND) and '|' (OR), which may be used to specify, respectively, that multiple processor profiles apply (simultaneously) or that any processor profile of a list of profiles may apply individually. If both operators are used in a codecs value, then the '+' operator has precedence.\nThe example: \"A+B|C+D|E\" states that a TTML processor that implements any one of A+B or C+D or E processor profiles satisfies, at first order, the requirements to fetch and begin decode/processing of a TTML document, where X+Y means that both X and Y processor profiles must be supported, and X|Y means that either X or Y processor profile must be supported.\nFor more information about processor profile combination, see TTML2 Profile Combination.\n\n\nEncoding considerations: binary\nSame for application/xml, except constrained to either UTF-8 or UTF-16.
