Its content is comprised\nof the digital signature of the data in the first body part of the\nenclosing multipart/signed and other control information required to\nverify that signature, as defined by Section 2.1.2.  The label\n\"application/moss-signature\" must be used as the value of the\nprotocol parameter of the enclosing multipart/signed; the protocol\nparameter must be present.\n\nPart of the signature verification information will be the Message\nIntegrity Check (MIC) algorithm(s) used during the signature creation\nprocess.  The MIC algorithm(s) identified in this body part must\nmatch the MIC algorithm(s) identified in the micalg parameter of the\nenclosing multipart/signed.  If it does (they do) not, a user agent\nshould identify the discrepancy to a user and it may choose to either\nhalt or continue processing, giving precedence to the algorithm(s)\nidentified in this body part.\n\nAn application/moss-signature body part is constructed as follows:\n\n   Content-Type: application/moss-signature\n\n   <mosssig>\n\nwhere the grammar token <mosssig> is defined as follows.\n\n   <mosssig>       ::= <version> ( 1*<origasymflds> )\n\n   <version>       ::= \"Version:\" \"5\" CRLF\n\n   <origasymflds>  ::= <origid> <micinfo>\n\n   <origid>        ::= \"Originator-ID:\" <id> CRLF\n\n   <micinfo>       ::= \"MIC-Info:\" <micalgid> \",\" <ikalgid> \",\"\n                       <asymsignmic> CRLF\n\nThe token <id> is defined in Section 4.  All other tokens are defined\nin Section 2.1.2.3.\n"
