The XPAK format itself does not provide any means\n   of verifying the package's authenticity. Furthermore, transferring\n   binary packages over insecure media may pose a privacy risk, or \n   even a security risk through exposing information about software \n   that is being installed on the system. Both of these concerns can \n   be addressed by using a secure transport such as HTTPS or SSH.\n\n   The XPAK format consists of a compressed .tar archive concatenated\n   with a custom XPAK trailer. The archive comprising the first part\n   can be compressed using one of the standard file compression tools\n   such as bzip2, xz or zstd. Implementations detect the compressed \n   file format via inspecting the file for the appropriate magic \n   bytes.\n\n   It is possible to use external archiving tools to inspect the \n   contents of the binary package.
