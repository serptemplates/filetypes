The considerations documented by Unicode Technical Report \n   #36: Unicode Security Considerations UnicodeTR#36 should be taken \n   into account.\n\n   The STIX standard does not itself specify a transport mechanism \n   for STIX documents. It is expected that TAXII is often used (which\n   uses TLS via HTTPS). As there is no transport mechanism specified,\n   it is up to the users of this to use an appropriately secured \n   transport method. For example, TLS, JSON Web Encryption [RFC7516] \n   and/or JSON Web Signature [RFC7515] can provide such mechanisms.\n\n   Documents of \"application/stix+json\" are STIX based Cyber Threat \n   Intelligence (CTI) documents. The documents may contain active or \n   executable content as well as URLs, IP addresses, and domain names\n   that are known or suspected to be malicious. Systems should thus \n   take appropriate precautions before decoding any of this content, \n   either for persistent storage or execution purposes. Such \n   precautions may include measures such as de-fanging, sandboxing, \n   or other measures. The samples included in STIX documents are \n   reference samples only, and there is no provision or expectation \n   in the specification that they will be loaded and/or executed. \n   There are provisions in the specification to encrypt these samples\n   so that even if a tool decodes the data, a further active step \n   must be done before the payload will be \"live\". It is highly \n   recommended that all active code be armored in this manner.\n\n   STIX specifies the use of hashing and encryption mechanisms for \n   some data types. A cryptography expert should be consulted when \n   choosing which hashing or encryption algorithms to use to ensure \n   that they do not have any security issues.\n\n   STIX provides a graph-based data model. As such, STIX \n   implementations should implement protections against graph queries\n   that can potentially consume a significant amount of resources and\n   prevent the implementation from functioning in a normal way.\n\n   This specification also describes \"STIX Patterning\", a mechanism \n   to describe and evaluate a search/match for data observed on \n   systems and networks. Patterning is a grammar itself and includes \n   PCRE regular expressions. Care should be taken when parsing and \n   evaluating the grammar (particularly when evaluating PCRE from \n   unknown or untrusted sources) as they can potentially consume a \n   significant amount of resources.\n\nPrivacy considerations: These considerations are, in part, derived \n   from Section 10 of the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information \n   Exchange [RFC8322].\n\n   Documents may include highly confidential, personal (PII), and/or \n   classified information. There are methods in the standard for \n   marking elements of the document such that the consumer knows of \n   these limitations. These markings may not always be used. For \n   example, an out-of-band agreement may cover and restrict sharing. \n   Just because a document is not marked as containing information \n   that should not be shared does not mean that a document is free \n   for sharing. It may be the case that a legal agreement has been \n   entered into between the parties sharing documents, and that each \n   party understands and follows their obligations under that \n   agreement as well as any applicable laws or regulations.\n\n   Adoption of the information-sharing approach described in this \n   document will enable users to more easily perform correlations \n   across separate, and potentially unrelated, cybersecurity \n   information providers. A client may succeed in assembling a data \n   set that would not have been permitted within the context of the\n   authorization policies of either provider when considered \n   individually. Thus, providers may face a risk of an attacker \n   obtaining an access that constitutes an undetected separation of \n   duties (SOD) violation. It is important to note that this risk is \n   not unique to this specification, and a similar potential for \n   abuse exists with any other cybersecurity information-sharing \n   protocol.\n\nInteroperability considerations: The STIX specification specifies the\n   format of conforming messages and the interpretation thereof.
