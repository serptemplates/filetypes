After spending some\ntime on the phone with Eudora's developer support, they convinced me to make\na MIME media type, so here goes:\n\nAfter plagerizing the format from the other e-mail submissions on your ftp\nsite, I've come up with the following submission;\n\nMedia Type: application\nMedia subtype name: vnd.seemail\nRequired parameters: none.\nOptional parameters: An optional version parameter can be specified.\nEncoding considerations: SeeMail files contain compressed binary data.\nSecurity considerations: none.\nPublished specifications:\n  Specification by example:\n    From an SeeMail application, select \"Send\" from the main application\n    screen.  Enter a filename, and click on \"OK\".\n  Specification by filename:\n    Typical file extension for the application/vnd.seemail subtype is \".see\"\n  Specification by Macintosh \"Creator\" type:\n    The seemail datafile is registered with Apple computer as data type \"SeeM\"\n    and creator type \"RMed\".\n  Free viewer:\n    A receive-only version of SeeMail is available at:\n    http://www.realmediainc.com\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\n  Steven Webb\n  Wyndemere\n  4875 Pearl East Circle, Suite 301\n  Boulder, Colorado 80301\n  (303) 444-8123\n  steve&wynde.com\n\nSeeMail is an application that captures video and sound, and uses bit-wise\ncompression to compress and archive the two pieces into a single file.  This\nfile is easily attached to a mail message, and sent via the internet to another\nSeeMail application.  With this MIME subtype definition, we will attempt to\nmake the e-mail/transmission part of the process automatic with a little help\nfrom EudoraPro by Qualcomm, inc.\n\n- Steven Webb\n\n        OO    E-mail: steve&wynde.com   *   Homepage: http://wynde.com/~steve/\n--ooOo-(  )-oOoo---------------------------------------------------------------\nPlease Note: Some Quantum Physics Theories Suggest That When the Recipient Is\nNot Directly Observing This e-mail, It May Cease to Exist or Will Exist Only in\na Vague and Undetermined State.\n\n\n\n"
