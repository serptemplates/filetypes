It was registered in 2006 to work with version 2.1 \r\n   of the Frogans Slide Description Language (FSDL) technical \r\n   specification. This type is no longer used as of version 3.0 of \r\n   the FSDL technical specification \r\n   (https://www.frogans.org/en/resources/fsdl/access.html) and has \r\n   been replaced by another mechanism, namely the 'leaptofrogans' URI\r\n   scheme, which contains a Frogans address and is described in RFC \r\n   8589 (https://www.rfc-editor.org/info/rfc8589).\r\n\r\n   The use of a media type for the distribution of Frogans short-cuts \r\n   on the Internet was determined to be unsatisfactory for the \r\n   reasons described in section 2 of RFC 8589. For example, using a \r\n   media type from a Web page to launch another application did not \r\n   always work, especially on mobile devices.\r\n\r\nAuthor/Change controller: Organization for the Promotion, Protection \r\n   and Progress of Frogans Technology (OP3FT) \r\n   <mailto:contact-standards&op3ft.org>"
