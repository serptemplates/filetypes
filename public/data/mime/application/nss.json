Modification means\nthe addition of an NSS body where none existed, the removal of an NSS body\nwhere one existed, or the changing of contents of existing NSS bodies in\nmessages. \nNSS can reveal information about telephone subscribers that is requested to\nremain private. Security mechanisms must be provided to meet privacy\nagreements and regulations. \n\nNSS can be deployed as an interdomain signaling mechanism and may be subject\nto trust relationships and agreements between administrative domains as well\nas legal requirements in various jurisdictions. NSS can affect routing of\ntelephone calls and associated billing. Security mechanisms must be provided\nto control fraud, malicious intents, and unintended consequences.\n\nSuch mechanisms include the ability to selectively filter or map and forward\neach information element within NSS upon entry or exit of an administrative\ndomain. It is expected that nodes performing such functions will be User\nAgents, such as gateway nodes or IP-based Application servers acting on\nbehalf of users. Note that RFC 3261 Section 16.6 says: \"The proxy MUST NOT\nadd to, modify, or remove the message body.\" That includes NSS bodies. All\ninformation from unauthenticated entities must be validated and authorized\nbefore being mapped and forwarded in subsequent signaling messages. Such\nchecks are particularly needed when information is mapped to/from SIP\nheaders. Note, however, that the intent of NSS is to carry data that would\nbe mutually exclusive with the data capable of being carried in SIP headers.\n\nWhen encapsulated by SIP, the integrity and confidentiality of SIP messages\ncontaining NSS bodies must be addressed. SIP mandates that Transport Layer\nSecurity (TLS) must be supported. The Internet Protocol Security (IPSEC)\nmechanisms may be used as an alternative on signaling hops between nodes\ntrusted to handle PSTN signaling. \nTLS and IPSEC are discussed in Section 26 of the Session Initiation Protocol\nRFC 3261. However, trusted nodes would need to specify and agree on the\nsecurity suites to be used with IPSEC.\nSee RFC 3324 for discussion on trust domains and related security\nrequirements.\n\nWhen intermediate hops are not trusted, end-to-end integrity and\nconfidentiality may be addressed using S/MIME:\n\nRFC 3850, \"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.1\nCertificate Handling\", July 2004.\n\nRFC 3851, \"Secure/Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (S/MIME) Version 3.1\nMessage Specification\", July 2004.\n\nRFC 3852, \"Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS)\", July 2004.\n\nRFC 3853, \"S/MIME Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) Requirement for the\nSession Initiation Protocol (SIP)\", July 2004.\n\nNSS MIME bodies should be secured using S/MIME to mitigate concerns with\nauthentication of the sender, integrity protection during transit, and\nconfidentiality protection from disclosure to unauthorized third parties.\nNSS endpoints must support S/MIME signatures and should support S/MIME\nencryption. \n\nFor H.323-based encapsulation of NSS bodies, the security mechanisms of\nITU-T Recommendation H.235, \"Security and encryption for H-series\n(H.323 and other H.245-based) multimedia terminals\", August 2003, must be\nused to provide integrity and confidentiality.\n\nNSS consists of well defined message types and parameters.
