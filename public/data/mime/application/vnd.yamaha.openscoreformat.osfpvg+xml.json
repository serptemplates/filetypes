Consequently, existing applications\ncapable of reading and writing MusicXML 2.0 files are expected to be capable of\nusing OSFPVG.\n\nIt should be noted that the OSFPVG format is intended to be used with a specific\ngenre of digital score whereas MusicXML is a general purpose format.\nInteroperability is therefore only intended with PVG scores.\n\n\nPublished specification :\nhttp://www.musicxml.org/xsd/osfpvg.xsd\n\nApplications which use this media :\nRecordare's Dolet 4 MusicXML import/export filter for Finale is capable of\nreading and writing containers that contain scores conforming to the OSFPVG schema.\n\nDue to OSFPVG predominantly being a subset of MusicXML 2.0, applications capable\nof reading and writing MusicXML 2.0 files are capable of reading and writing\nOSFPVG also.\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : none\n2. File extension(s) : xml\n3. Macintosh file type code : none\n4. Object Identifiers: none\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Mark Olleson\n2. Email : mark.olleson&yamaha.co.uk\n\nIntended usage : Common\n\n\nAuthor/Change controller : Yamaha Corporation\n\n\n(file created 2009-03-11)"
