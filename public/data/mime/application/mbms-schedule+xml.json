Thus the usage of the format is vulnerable to attacks modifying or \nspoofing the content of this format. It is recommended to use source \nauthentication and integrity protection. The information carried in the media \nformat does not contain any privacy information such as passwords or keys. The \ninformation carried in the media format does not contain executable content. \nContent from other namespaces may be introduced into this media type by \nextensions defined by 3GPP, and thus security considerations inherited from \nthose extensions will need to be considered as new extensions are defined in \nfuture releases.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\n\n\nPublished specification :\n3GPP TS 26.346\n\nApplications which use this media :\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : none\n2. File extension(s) : none\n3. Macintosh file type code : none\n4. Object Identifiers: none\n\nSee http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/archive/26_series/26.346/26346-9a0.zip annex \nC.14.\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Eric Turcotte\n2.
