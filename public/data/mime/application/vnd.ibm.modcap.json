It is\n       not a programming language, does not contain any\n       file operators, and therefore cannot corrupt a\n       receiver's file system or programming environment.\n       MO:DCA and Mixed Object Document Content Architecture\n       are trademarks of the IBM Corporation.\n\n     Interoperability considerations: MO:DCA-P defines\n       interchange sets to support interoperability.\n       Currently defined sets are Interchange Set 1 (IS/1)\n       and Interchange Set 2 (IS/2).\n\n     Published specification: 'Mixed Object Document Content\n       Architecture Reference', IBM publication SC31-6802\n\n     Applications which use this media type: Advanced Function\n       Presentation (AFP), ImagePlus, VisualInfo, Graphical Data\n       Display Manager (GDDM), DisplayWrite, Graphical Display\n       and Query Facility (GDQF)\n\n     Additional information:\n\n       Magic number(s): X'D3', X'D3A8', X'D3A9'\n       File extension(s): list3820, listafp, afp, pseg3820\n       Macintosh File Type Code(s): none\n\n     Person & email address to contact for further information:\n       Reinhard Hohensee, rhohensee&vnet.ibm.com\n\n     Intended usage: OBSOLETE\n        Obsoleted in favor of application/vnd.afpc.modca\n\n     Author/Change controller:\n       Reinhard Hohensee, rhohensee&vnet.ibm.com\n\n\n"
