The current implementation of the KMZ \r\nmedia type allows it to contain:\r\n- KML files (an XML-based plain text file)\r\n- image files (jpg, png, gif, tif)\r\n- DAE files (also known as Collada files, another XML-based plain text file)\r\nThe KMZ media type cannot contain any active or executable content. (However, \r\nit is worth noting that given the nature of the zip archive, there is nothing \r\nto prevent authors from creating such files. Any client implementation of the \r\nKMZ media type has to be aware of such possibilities and refuse to read any \r\nfile-type not explicitly enumerated within the client as acceptable.)\r\n\r\n\r\nInteroperability considerations :\r\nThere are no special interoperability issues. KMZ files behave just as ZIP \r\nfiles on any platform.\r\n\r\nPublished specification :\r\nA specification and reference for KMZ may be found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://earth.google.com/kml/\r\n\r\nApplications which use this media :\r\nThe KMZ filetype was designed for use in, and first implemented by, the Google \r\nEarth geospatial browser. More information on Google Earth can be found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://earth.google.com/\r\n\r\nSeveral other applications that provide some amount of KML support at this \r\ntime, and it is expected that several will soon do so in the near future. \r\nAmongst these are:\r\n\r\nSketchUp ( http://sketchup.com/ )\r\nNASA World Wind ( http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/ )\r\nESRI ArcGIS Explorer ( http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer/ )\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information :\r\n\r\n1. Magic number(s) : 50 4b 03 04\r\n2. File extension(s) : kmz\r\n3. Macintosh file type code : GKmz\r\n4. Object Identifiers: NONE\r\n\r\nKMZ is the zip-compressed archive of a KML file and any referenced local \r\n(machine) files (e.g. images used in overlays). At least one KML file is \r\nrequired in the top-level of the archived hierarchy, and an arbitrary number \r\nof subfolders and files may be archived.\r\n\r\nKML is an acronym for Keyhole Markup Langage, which stems from the time before \r\nthe Keyhole Corporation was acquried by Google, and their Keyhole application \r\nredesigned and rebranded as Google Earth.\r\n\r\nKML is an XML-based file format and grammar for modeling and storing \r\ngeographic features such as points, lines, images, and polygons for display in \r\na geospatial browser. The KML file is a UTF-8 encoded text file.\r\n\r\nPerson to contact for further information :\r\n\r\n1. Name : Michael Ashbridge\r\n2. Email : mashbridge+iana&google.com\r\n\r\nIntended usage : Common\r\nIt is not unreasonable to expect that the use of KMZ files will be comparable \r\nto the use of PDF files.\r\n\r\nAuthor/Change controller : Michael Ashbridge\r\n\r\n\r\n(file created 2006-11-13)"
