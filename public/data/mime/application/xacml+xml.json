    "template_text": "(registered 2013-09-25, last updated 2013-11-11)\n\n   Media Type Name: application\n\n   Subtype Name: xacml+xml\n\n   Required Parameters: none\n\n   Optional Parameters:\n\n      charset: The charset parameter is the same as the charset\n      parameter of application/xml [RFC3023], including the same default\n      (see Section 3.2 of RFC 3023).\n\n      version: The version parameter indicates the version of the XACML\n      specification.  It can be used for content negotiation when\n      dealing with clients and servers that support multiple XACML\n      versions.  Its range is the range of published XACML versions.  As\n      of this writing, that is 1.0 [XACML-1], 1.1 [XACML-1.1], 2.0\n      [XACML-2], and 3.0 [XACML-3].  These and future version\n      identifiers must follow the Organization for the Advancement of\n      Structured Information Standards (OASIS) patterns for versions\n      [OASIS-Version].  If this parameter is not specified by the\n      client, the server is free to return any version it deems fit.  If\n      a client cannot or does not want to deal with that, it should\n      explicitly specify a version.\n\n   Encoding Considerations: Same as for application/xml [RFC3023].\n\n   Security Considerations:\n\n      Per their specification, objects of type application/xacml+xml do\n      not contain executable content.  However, these objects are XML-\n      based, and thus they have all of the general security\n      considerations presented in Section 10 of RFC 3023 [RFC3023].\n\n      XACML [XACML-3] contains information about whose integrity and\n      authenticity is important -- identity provider and service\n      provider public keys and endpoint addresses, for example.\n      Sections 9.2.1 \"Authentication\" and 9.2.4 \"Policy Integrity\" in\n      XACML [XACML-3] describe requirements and considerations for such\n      authentication and integrity protection.\n\n      To counter potential issues, the publisher may sign objects of\n      type application/xacml+xml.  Any such signature should be verified\n      -- both as a valid signature and as being the signature of the\n      publisher -- by the recipient of the data.  The XACML v3.0 XML\n      Digital Signature Profile [XACML-3-DSig] describes how to use XML-\n      based digital signatures with XACML.\n\n      Additionally, various possible publication protocols, for example,\n      HTTPS, offer means for ensuring the authenticity of the publishing\n      party and for protecting the policy in transit.\n\n      Interoperability Considerations: Different versions of XACML use\n      different XML namespace URIs:\n\n      *  1.0 and 1.1 use the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy XML\n         namespace URI for policies and the\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context XML namespace URI for\n         requests and responses\n\n      *  2.0 uses the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:policy XML namespace\n         URI for policies and the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context\n         XML namespace URI for requests and responses\n\n      *  3.0 uses the urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17 XML\n         namespace URI for policies, requests, and responses\n\n      Signed XACML has a wrapping Security Assertion Markup Language\n      (SAML) 2.0 assertion [SAML-2], which uses the\n      urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion namespace URI.\n      Interoperability with SAML is defined by the SAML 2.0 Profile of\n      XACML [XACML-3-SAML] for all versions of XACML.\n\n   Applications That Use This Media Type:\n\n      Potentially, any application implementing or using XACML, as well\n      as those applications implementing or using specifications based\n      on XACML.  In particular, applications using the Representational\n      State Transfer (REST) Profile [XACML-REST] can benefit from this\n      media type.\n\n   Magic Number(s):\n\n      In general, this is the same as for application/xml [RFC3023].  In\n      particular, the XML document element of the returned object will\n      be one of xacml:Policy, xacml:PolicySet, context:Request, or\n      context:Response.  The xacml and context namespace prefixes bind\n      to the respective namespace URIs for the various versions of XACML\n      as follows:\n\n      *  1.0 and 1.1: The xacml prefix maps to\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:policy; the context prefix maps to\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:1.0:context\n\n      *  2.0: The xacml prefix maps to\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:policy; the context prefix maps to\n         urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:2.0:context\n\n      *  3.0: Both the xacml and context prefixes map to the namespace\n         URI urn:oasis:names:tc:xacml:3.0:core:schema:wd-17\n\n      For signed XACML [XACML-3-DSig], the XML document element is saml:\n      Assertion, where the saml prefix maps to the SAML 2.0 namespace\n      URI urn:oasis:names:tc:SAML:2.0:assertion [SAML-2].\n\n   File Extension(s): none\n\n   Macintosh File Type Code(s): none\n\n   Person & Email Address to Contact for Further Information:\n\n      This registration is made on behalf of the OASIS eXtensible Access\n      Control Markup Language Technical Committee (XACMLTC).  Please\n      refer to the XACMLTC website for current information on committee\n      chairperson(s) and their contact addresses:\n      http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/xacml/.  Committee members\n      should submit comments and potential errors to the\n      xacml&lists.oasis-open.org list.  Others should submit them by\n      filling out the web form located at http://www.oasis-open.org/\n      committees/comments/form.php?wg_abbrev=xacml.\n\n      Additionally, the XACML developer community email distribution\n      list, xacml-dev&lists.oasis-open.org, may be employed to discuss\n      usage of the application/xacml+xml MIME media type.  The xacml-dev\n      mailing list is publicly archived here:\n      http://www.oasis-open.org/archives/xacml-dev/.  To post to the\n      xacml-dev mailing list, one must subscribe to it.  To subscribe,\n      visit the OASIS mailing list page at\n      http://www.oasis-open.org/mlmanage/.\n\n   Intended Usage: common\n\n   Author/Change Controller:\n\n      The XACML specification sets are a work product of the OASIS\n      eXtensible Access Control Markup Language Technical Committee\n      (XACMLTC).  OASIS and the XACMLTC have change control over the\n      XACML specification sets.\n"
