The <events> root element is defined by XML schema described in the Published specification.\n\nEncoding considerations : binary\n\n\nSecurity considerations : \nSame as general security considerations for application/xml media type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. In addition, this media type provides a format for exchanging information in SIP, so the security considerations from IETF RFC 3261apply.\nThe information transported in this media type does not include active or executable content.\nMechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol parameters exist. Those mechanisms as well as authentication and further security mechanisms are described in 3GPP TS 24.229.\nThis media type does not include provisions for directives that institute actions on a recipient's files or other resources.\nThis media type does not include provisions for directives that institute actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient, may result in disclosure of information that either facilitates a subsequent attack or else violates a recipient's privacy in any way.\nThis media type does not employ compression.\n\n\nInteroperability considerations : \nSame as general interoperability considerations for application/xml media type as specified in section 9.1 of IETF RFC 7303. Any unknown XML elements and any unknown XML attributes are to be ignored by recipient of the MIME body.\n\nPublished specification : \n3GPP TS 24.237 \"IP Multimedia Subsystem (IMS) Service Continuity\", version 11.15.0, available via http://www.3gpp.org/specs/numbering.htm.\n\nApplications which use this media : \nApplications supporting the service continuity as described in the published specification.\n\nFragment identifier considerations :\nThe handling in section 5 of IETF RFC 7303 applies.\n\nRestrictions on usage :\nNone\n\nProvisional registration? (standards tree only) :\nn/a\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Deprecated alias names for this type : n/a\n2. Magic number(s) : n/a\n3. File extension(s) : n/a\n4. Macintosh file type code : n/a\n5. Object Identifiers: n/a\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Frederic Firmin\n2. Email : frederic.firmin&etsi.org\n\nIntended usage : Common\ncommon\n\nAuthor/Change controller : Frederic Firmin"
