Recipients need to understand that they are at \nthe \"mercy\" of the sender, when receiving this type of data, since \ndata will be executed on their system, and the security of their \nmachines can be violated.\n\n\nInteroperability considerations : \nnone.\n\nPublished specification : \nnone.\n\nApplications which use this media : \nGroove\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1.
