Here we propose a \n   new structured json based format for comics. We treat comic files \n   as ordered sets of images that either referred by URL or \n   distributed along with the packeting file itself.\n\nPublished specification: {\n   // comic file name\n   \"name\": \"\",\n   // reading mode 1-vertical (Transverse) comic 2-manga\n   \"mode\": 1,\n   // comic picture list (ordered)\n   \"list\": [\n   {\n   // comic picture name\n   \"name\": \"\",\n   // URL of the picture\n   \"url\": \"\"\n   }\n   ],\n   // comic file configurations (as the configurations in the xml file in CBZ)\n   config: {},\n   // custom parameters\n   custom: {}\n   }\n\n   Q: Are the images just following the end of the JSON file?\n\n   A: The format is designed to be dynamic as the concrete image can \n   either be referred by a URL as in Markdown or be attached locally \n   to the object in transfer. Of course, this will expect \n   corresponding clients know that the URL may not valid and handle \n   the error properly.\n\n   Q: Is this using some archive format like ZIP or tar?\n\n   A: The comic book object in this format is not designed to be \n   transmitted all at once in any compressed format. In the \n   experimental implementation, APIs are available for user to \n   download the comic book in old compressed formats such as cbz or \n   cb7. However the designated scenario is that the client load the \n   concrete pictures in a sequenced stream for better reading \n   experience.\n\nApplications which use this media: Any application that processes or \n   illustrates image sets intended for comics.\n\nFragment identifier considerations: N/A\n\nRestrictions on usage: None",
