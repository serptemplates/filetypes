The latter may also be suitable for WWW\nvector image graphics. IGES files include parameters about the IGES\nobject itself, e.g., version number, model size, encoded elements. The\nIGES Project committee has approved (3/94) the submission for\nregistration of the format as a MIME data type.\n\n--------- issue noted during comment period -------------\n\nProposed registration (as it appears above) sent to\nietf-types&cs.utk.edu on 3/15/95 per RFC 1590 resulted in discussions\nabout the possible need for a new 3D Media Type. (This discussion was\nraised when registration for VRML was proposed.) The IGES Project\npeople opined that at such time as the the requirements are resolved\nand new Types registered (e.g., Type CAD or Type 3D), that IGES, and\nperhaps other formats, may need to be considered for repositioning as\nsubtypes of such new Media Type. However, using the above Type/Subtype\nand IGES viewers has demonstrated the expected functionality.\n\n[]\n\n\n"
