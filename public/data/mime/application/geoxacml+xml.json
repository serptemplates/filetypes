These and future version identifiers must follow the OGC patterns for versions [OGC 06-135]: the pattern includes the major and minor version numbers to the first decimal place only (e.g., 1.1).

The language defines the data type geometry and geographic functions as defined in [ISO 19107] that enable policies with geo-specific functions. Requests, responses, and policies are based on XACML schemas. Clients send a request to a server to query whether a given action should be allowed. The server evaluates the request against the available policies and returns a response. The policies implement the organization's access control requirements.\n\nAuthor/Change controller: Open Geospatial Consortium\n\nReferences:\n[oasis-access_control-xacml-2.0-core-spec-os] OASIS: eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) Version 2.0, 1 Feb 2005 http://docs.oasis-open.org/xacml/2.0/access_control-xacml-2.0-core-specos.pdf\n\n[xacml-3.0-dsig-v1.0] OASIS: XACML v3.0 XML Digital Signature Profile Version 1.0.
