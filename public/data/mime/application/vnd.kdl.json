No privacy or integrity services are necessary on its own, besides any desired data protection at the user/application level. Still, the data itself might be sensitive in its particular use case.\n\n3. Transfer of KDL documents over the network can be secured through external means, such as TLS or SSH encryption.\n\n4. There are no built-in linking facilities of any sort. KDL is a pure data language, much like JSON, and does not even provide cross-file referencing/imports or internal referencing. What you see is what you get.\n\n5. Additionally, the format itself takes certain measures against superficial attacks, such as banning certain uses of \"direction control\" characters and various other control characters.\n\n6. KDL accepts a very wide range of UTF-8 characters, including \"invisible\" unicode characters. While all unicode whitespace is considered actual whitespace by the language, non-whitespace invisible characters are treated just like anything else. That means that what might look to a reader as two separate items in a list might, in fact, be a single one.\n\n7. Likewise, KDL reserves a very small number of characters as special syntax characters, but it is possible to craft documents with \"lookalikes\" (e.g. equals signs other than `=`, or \"smart quotes\") that would result in semantically different data than what might initially be perceived.\n\n8. Even so, this is a vector shared by a very large number of similar formats, and it was decided that playing \"whack-a-mole\" with such characters would be ultimately unproductive, or even worse, give someone a false sense of security.\n\nInteroperability considerations: KDL provides a thorough specification (https://github.com/kdl-org/kdl/blob/23918bd55d13fb1e6d895a60db4f991e25887e8a/SPEC.md).

Some facilities for this are provided, such as `#nan` `#inf` and `#-inf` for implementations which might choose to support those special IEEE 754 values.\n\nPublished specification: N/A (not going into the spec tree).
