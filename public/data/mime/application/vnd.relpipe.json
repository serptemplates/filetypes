Because it may contain any data (generic \n   format), it may also contain sensitive data. It is up to the user \n   to secure the message on the protocol or container level (TLS, \n   S/MIME, GPG etc.) when needed.\n\nPrimary use of this format is IPC (inter-process communication) on a \n   local machine, between two processes, mostly owned by the same \n   user. However data in this format may be transferred also over \n   e.g. HTTP(S) or e-mail, so having a Media type is desired.\n\n   Regarding DoS: data in this binary format contain length-prefixed \n   values, thus corrupted/malicious data + buggy implementation can \n   lead to attempt to allocate huge amounts of memory. However this \n   caveat is common for almost any binary format.\n\nInteroperability considerations: Data in this format have same \n   representation regardless platform operating system, default \n   encoding, endianness, CPU architecture etc. Text attributes are \n   serialized in UTF-8 regardless local default encoding. Integer \n   numbers are serialized as LEB128. Booleans are simply 0x00/0x01. \n   Other data types will be also strictly machine-readable and \n   platform independent.",
