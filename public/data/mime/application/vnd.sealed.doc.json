They are specified \nby Sealed Media. The registration of this content-type is intended only to \nprovide a convention for labeling this proprietary data type within the \nMIME/HTTP environment and does not specify any details about the content \nformat or semantics, except to refer to the software and specifications \nprovided by Sealed Media. Company information may be obtained at http://www.sealedmedia.com.\n\nApplications which use this media : \nThis mime-type is intended for use only by the client software, \n\"Unsealer\", created by Sealed Media.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1.
