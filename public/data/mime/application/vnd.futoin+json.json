It covers\n   request, response and error message format types.\n\n   The semantics of a specific interface utilizing the media type are\n   not specified by the media type itself.\n\n   As a consequence:\n\n   1. Even though active or executable content may be encapsulated by\n      users, it is discouraged.\n   \n   A general-purpose client or server must never try to execute any \n      code found in the payload.\n\n   2. The privacy of all messages employing this media type should be\n      maintained by the peer-to-peer communications layer; there is \n      no mechanism in the media type itself that provides privacy \n      protection.\n\n   2.1. There is no strict requirement for data privacy protection of\n      a generic message. However, interface specifications that \n      employ this media type may impose such restrictions on a \n      case-by-case basis.\n\n   2.2. There is an optional extensible message integrity mechanism \n      based on the \"sec\" message field.\n\n   3. There are a number of mechanisms external to this media type \n      that can used to require and/or provide additional security:\n\n   3.1. Optional \"SecureChannel\" interface constraint as defined in \n      FTN3.\n\n      This can be used to to insure that transmission occurs over a \n      channel that provides both data privacy and data integrity \n      protection.\n\n      Modern TLS, VPN, or similar technologies can be used to meet \n      this requirement.\n\n      All peers involved in the communication must reject processing \n      if this requirement is not fulfilled.\n\n   3.2. Optional \"MessageSignature\" interface constraint as defined \n      in FTN3. This can be used to require that each message be \n      signed by strong Message Authentication Code or equal.\n\n      All peers involved in the communication must reject processing \n      if:\n\n         a) this requirement is not fulfilled,\n         b) and/or \"sec\" field coding format is not supported,\n         c) and/or signature verification fails.\n\n   3.3. Unless optional \"AllowAnonymous\" interface requirement as \n      defined in FTN3 is set, request message processing peer \n      (Executor as in FTN3) must require some type of client \n      authentication. Otherwise, processing of such request must be \n      rejected.\n\n      Additionally, this media type inherits security considerations \n      from: \n\n      The JavaScript Object Notation\n      (JSON) Data Interchange Format - \n      https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc8259#section-12\n\n   Interoperability considerations:\n\n   1. For messages coding and security:\n\n      1.1. FutoIn specifications are revised and extended over\n      time. A compliant implementation must reject processing, if any \n      part of the message is not recognized.\n\n   1.2. Response message must always be coded in the same media type\n      format as the request message, if it can be recognized.\n\n      JSON is a safe fallback for error messages related to request \n      decoding.\n\n   1.3. JSON-coded message should always start from byte with value \n      0x7B (ASCII symbol \"{\") for fast auto-detection.\n\n   2. For semantical compatibility:\n\n      FTN3 defines special rules for backward compatible interface\n      definition changes. Based on the rules, Invoker peer which uses\n      older minor version of interface specification must always be \n      able to call Executor which uses newer minor version of the \n      same major version.\n\n   3. For generic compliance:\n\n      It is common in field when at least one peer in communication \n      is not fully compliant to FTN3.
