    "template_text": "(RFC 3161 published August 2001, subtype last updated April August 2001)\n\nThis section specifies a means for conveying ASN.1-encoded messages\nfor the protocol exchanges described in Section 2 and Appendix D via\nInternet mail.\n\nTwo MIME objects are specified as follows:\n\nContent-Type: application/timestamp-query\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n<<the ASN.1 DER-encoded Time-Stamp message, base64-encoded>>\n\nContent-Type: application/timestamp-reply\nContent-Transfer-Encoding: base64\n<<the ASN.1 DER-encoded Time-Stamp message, base64-encoded>>\n\nThese MIME objects can be respectively sent and received using common\nMIME processing engines and provides a simple Internet mail transport\nfor Time-Stamp messages.\n\nFor the application/timestamp-query and application/timestamp-reply\nMIME types, implementations SHOULD include the optional \"name\" and\n\"filename\" parameters.  Including a file name helps preserve type\ninformation when time-stamp queries and replies are saved as files.\nWhen these parameters are included, a file name with the appropriate\nextension SHOULD be selected:\n\n        MIME Type                     File Extension\n   application/timestamp-query            .TSQ\n   application/timestamp-reply            .TSR\n\nIn addition, the file name SHOULD be limited to eight characters\nfollowed by a three letter extension.  The eight character filename\nbase can be any distinct name."
