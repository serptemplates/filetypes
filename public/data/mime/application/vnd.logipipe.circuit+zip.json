A file can be\n   maliciously crafted to deliberately expand way beyond its original\n   size. However, it is also possible that the application program \n   will crash because the circuit represented by the file is too \n   complex to fit into memory of the user’s system. The application \n   program may also crash because the disk is full. It is also \n   possible that the filling of available space will cause other \n   programs to crash. The user must understand that a computer’s \n   resources are finite, and this is a risk that must be accepted, \n   especially if the data comes from an unknown source.\n\n   It is possible for a circuit expressed in this media type to \n   contain a circular reference, which may cause a stack overflow \n   when loaded in a user's device. The program detects circular \n   references by checking to see if a subcircuit has been visited \n   before as it descends down the subcircuit hierarchary. There is no\n   guarantee that all possible situations where a circular reference \n   could cause a stack overflow have been uncovered during program \n   testing. The Java virtual machine should terminate the program \n   before other areas of memory are overwritten due to a stack \n   overflow.\n\n   A file in this format may contain links to malicious websites \n   which are beyond the control of the application program, and the \n   user must accept all the risks of clicking on such a link. Since \n   files in this format may be found anywhere on the internet and may\n   even arrive as spam in email messages, the user must be aware that\n   not all sources can be trusted.\n\n   This media type represents an electronic circuit which is \n   simulated by the application program. The circuit may reference \n   other files in the applications project and library directories \n   and include them as part of the simulation, either as subcircuits \n   or as data used by components in the circuit, such as external \n   data representing the voltage generated by a piecewise linear \n   voltage source or the contents of simulated read only memory. The \n   absence or presence of such files may determine whether or not the\n   simulation succeeds. The user starts the simulation by hitting the\n   play button and stops the simulation by hitting the pause or \n   rewind buttons. The application program will consume large amounts\n   of processing time while the simulation is in progress, which will\n   rapidly drain the battery of the user’s system. The circuit has \n   access to the microphone and some sensors on the user’s system \n   while the simulation is in progress.\n\n   The user has the ability to send a circuit that may consist of a \n   composite of a circuit opened by the program and files in the \n   application’s project and library directories to another \n   application, which may be an email client. If these files contain \n   sensitive data, this data will be included as part of the file \n   representing the circuit that is being sent. The program will not \n   perform this action unless the user explicitly selects the \n   appropriate action from the menu and then confirms this action by \n   selecting the destination application.\n\n   In addition to bugs in the application program, there may be \n   unforeseen security risks. New features may be added to the \n   application program which may introduce new security risks.\n\nInteroperability considerations: Logipipe CircuitSafari is the only \n   application that uses this file format, but there are no \n   restrictions on the development of other applications that may use\n   this file format.
