The message containing this content type might be\ndirected towards an automatic or manual responder, which may be\nmail-based, depending on the local implementation and environment.\nThe application/mosskey-request content type is an independent body\npart because it is entirely independent of any other body part.\n\nIf the application/mosskey-request content contains a Certification:\nfield it requests certification of the self-signed certificate in the\nfield value.  If the content contains an Issuer: field it requests\nthe Certificate Revocation List (CRL) chain beginning with the CRL of\nthe issuer identified in the field value.  If the content contains a\nSubject: field it requests either the public key of the subject or a\ncertificate chain beginning with the subject identified in the field\nvalue, or both if both exist.\n\nThe Subject: and Issuer: fields each contain a value of type <id>,\nwhich is defined in Section 4.\n\nOne possible response to receiving an application/mosskey-request\nbody part is to construct and return an application/mosskey-data body\npart.  When returning public keys, certificate chains, and\ncertificate revocation list chains, if there exists more than one,\nseveral application/mosskey-data body parts are to be returned in the\nreply message, one for each."
