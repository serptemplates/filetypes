The handler that is activated in response to a\nspecified event may be either a voice dialog or a script that can be\neither in the same or an external document.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\n\nBecause XHTML+Voice is built upon W3C standard recommendations, it is\ndesigned to be interoperable across a wide range of platforms and\nclient devices.  Because the extensions to XHTML are identified by\ntheir namespaces, all browsers that have namespace support can run an\nXHTML+Voice document as an XHTML document without voice interaction.\n   \nPublished specification:\n\n   The latest published version of XHTML+Voice is [XPLUSV12].\n\nApplications which use this media type:\n\n   XHTML+Voice documents are intended to be deployed on the World\n   Wide Web and rendered by multimodal browsers that support the\n   visual and voice modes of interaction.  Because XHTML+Voice is\n   an application of XML, authors can expect XHTML+Voice user\n   agents to be conformant XML 1.0 [XML] processors.  See section\n   2 of [RFC3236].\n\nAdditional information:\n\n   Magic number(s):  There is no single string that is always\n       present.\n   File extension(s): mxml, xhvml, xvml, xvm\n   Macintosh File Type Code(s): TEXT\n\nPerson & e-mail address to contact for further information:\n\n   Gerald M.
