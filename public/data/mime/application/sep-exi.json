This section defines the rules for a \n   string used to declare acceptable encodings and extensions of a \n   node. The Extensibility Level defines the base schema and its \n   capability for arbitrary extension. The Extensibility Level string \n   is one of “-S0” or “+S0”. The application/sep-exi indicates EXI \n   capability. The S0 indicates the base schema version: SEP2. “-S0” \n   indicates the node does not accept arbitrary tags that are not \n   defined in the base schema, and “+S0” indicates it accepts \n   arbitrary tags. A node with “-S0” MAY return error on EXI or XML\n   message with arbitrary types, elements, and attributes that are not\n   defined in the schema used for encoding. Sending messages with \n   arbitrary types, elements, and attributes on nodes that declare \n   “-S0” SHOULD be avoided.\n\n   The format of level string is ‘(-|+)S[i]’ where i is a character to\n   describe base schema version (currently ‘0’). As extension of \n   SEP2.x schemas should be backward compatible, a node declares \n   schema ID ‘S[i]’ can be assumed to be compatible for all versions \n   between ‘S0’ and ‘S[i]’.\n\n   A client SHOULD check if a server accepts non-strict part of EXI\n   document prior to PUT/POST operations on the server before sending\n   message with extended attributes/elements. A server SHOULD check \n   if a client accepts extended non-strict part of EXI document prior\n   to give responses to GET operations to the client before returning \n   message with extended attributes/elements.\n\nOptional parameters: None\n\nEncoding considerations: binary\n\nSecurity considerations: This media type is used for energy \n   management (specifically for conveying information such as demand \n   response signals, pricing information, and energy usage \n   information) which may, depending on the circumstances, require \n   privacy and integrity protections.
