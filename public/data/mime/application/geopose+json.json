It can be used for content negotiation when dealing with clients and servers that support multiple GeoPose versions. Its range is the range of published GeoPose versions. As of this writing those are: 1.0 [OGC 21-056r11]. These and future version identifiers must follow the OGC patterns for versions [OGC 06-135]: the pattern includes the major and minor version numbers to the first decimal place only (e.g., 1.1). If this parameter is not specified by the client, the server is free to return any version it deems fit. If a client cannot or does not want to deal with version ambiguity, it should explicitly specify a version.\n\nEncoding considerations: binary\n\nSecurity considerations: Per their specification, application/geopose+json typed objects do not contain executable content.
