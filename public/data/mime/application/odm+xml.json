All means the entire study; Metadata means the \n   MetaDataVersion element; AdminData and ReferenceData mean the \n   corresponding elements; AllClinicalData, SingleSite, and \n   SingleSubject are successively more tightly focused subset of the \n   study's clinical data. Each of the granularities listed represents \n   a valid ODM document structure. If not present, no default \n   granularity value is implied.\n\n   odmversion=x.y.z\n\n   ODMVersion indicates the CDISC ODM standard version of the \n   document. For example, odmversion=(1.2.0 | 1.2.1 | 1.3.0 | 1.3.1 | \n   1.3.2 | 2.0.0) lists alternatives for currently supported versions \n   of ODM. As new versions of the standard are published by CDISC, \n   these versions will follow the specified versioning syntax (e.g. \n   2.0.1). Each ODM version has a corresponding specification and \n   schema. The numbering scheme indicates the major, minor, and patch \n   versions as shown in the x.y.z syntax. A major version indicates \n   significant changes that are not compatiable with the previous \n   version. A minor version adds functionality to the standard in a\n   backwards-compatible manner. A patch version adds \n   backwards-compatible bug fixes. If not present, no default \n   odmversion value is implied.\n\nEncoding considerations:  Same as application/xml - see section 9.1 \n   of RFC 7303.\n\nSecurity considerations: As an XML-based type, this media type \n   inherits the security considerations of XML- see RFC 7303 section \n   10.
