If an attacker is able to substitute another schema in place of the intended one, the semantics of the EXI document could be changed in some ways. As an example, EXI is sensitive to the order of the values in an enumeration. It is not known whether such an attack is possible on the actual structure of the document.\n\nAlso, EXI supports user-defined datatype representations, and such representations, if present in a document and purportedly understood by a processor, can be a security weakness. Definitions of these representations are expected to be external, often application- or industry-specific, so any definition needs to be analyzed carefully from the security perspective before being adopted.",
