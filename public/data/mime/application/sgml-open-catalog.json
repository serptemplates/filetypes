(A character repertoire describes a set of characters,\n        where a character is an atom of information.  A character repertoire \n        does not describe any of the common attributes typically associated \n        with a character such as the character's form or coded representation.\n        For example, the letter capital cee is a character, it can take the \n        form C and has the US-ASCII coded representation of 67 decimal.)\n        The mapping from the sequence of octets making up the message body, \n        to the sequence of characters making up the catalog, is indicated by \n        the charset parameter of the Content-Type MIME header line [RFC1521].  \n\n        The value of the charset parameter must be one that is registered\n        with IANA [RFC1700], or employ an extension-token, such as X-big10. \n        In general, it should be possible to infer the character repertoire \n        and coded character set from the name of the encoding.\n\n        If no value is supplied, the default shall be US-ASCII.\nEncoding considerations: Some encodings of coded character sets may\n                         require that an additional\n                         content-transfer-encoding be applied. \nSecurity considerations: This media type contains SGML references to \n                         external object, files, and programs.
