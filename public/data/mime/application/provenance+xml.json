Note in particular, the privacy issues in [RFC3023]\nsection 10 for HTTP URIs. Data obtained from an inaccurate or\nmalicious data source may lead to inaccurate or misleading\nconclusions, as well as the dereferencing of unintended URIs. Care\nmust be taken to align the trust in consulted resources with the\nsensitivity of the intended use of the data. PROV-XML can express data\nwhich is presented to the user, for example, by means of label\nattributes. Application rendering strings retrieved from untrusted\nPROV-N documents must ensure that malignant strings may not be used to\nmislead the reader. The security considerations in the media type\nregistration for XML ([RFC3023] section 10) provide additional\nguidance around the expression of arbitrary data and markup.\n\nPROV-XML is a language for describing the provenance of things, and\ntherefore a PROV-XML document is metadata for other resources.\nUntrusted PROV-XML documents may mislead its consumers by indicating\nthat a third-party resource has a reputable lineage, when it has not.\nProvenance of PROV-XML document should be sought.\n\nPROV-XML uses QNames mappable to IRIs as term identifiers.\nApplications interpreting data expressed in PROV-XML should address\nthe security issues of Internationalized Resource Identifiers (IRIs)\n[RFC3987] Section 8, as well as Uniform Resource Identifier (URI):\nGeneric Syntax [RFC3986] Section 7.\n\nMultiple IRIs may have the same appearance.
