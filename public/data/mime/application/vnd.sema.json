Furthermore, the data within is encrypted with 256 bit\r\nkeys only known to the intended data owner.\r\n\r\nInteroperability considerations : \r\nCurrently the subtype \"sema\" has parser support on Windows Platforms\r\n(98, ME, NT, 2000 and XP) - however other platforms are to be covered in the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nPublished specification : \r\nThere is currently no RFC available for the media-type\r\n\"application/vnd.sema\".\r\n\r\nApplications which use this media : \r\nClients of Secured eMail (www.securedemail.org). Currently, clients are\r\nMicrosoft Office 2000, XP (w/o content) and 2003. Groupwise and Outlook\r\nExpress are planned.\r\n\r\nAdditional information :\r\n\r\n1. Magic number(s) : varies depending on object type and version 2. File\r\nextension(s) : .sema 3. Macintosh file type code : none, missing 4. Object\r\nIdentifiers: none, missing\r\n\r\nSema derives its name from \"Secured EMail Archive\". A cornerstone in the\r\nconcept of secured emailing is that the intended recipient of a email gets\r\nthe email intact. This is why it is important that the \"sema\" subtype is\r\nrecognized as a MIME media type.\r\n\r\nPerson to contact for further information :\r\n\r\n1. Name : Peter Davin\r\n2. Email : peter.davin&securedemail.org\r\n\r\nIntended usage : Common \r\nThe subtype \"sema\" is ment to be a extension to the world of secured\r\nemail communication, and act as a archive container for encrypted data in\r\ngeneral. It is a encrypted binary package that can be locked with multiple\r\nkeys - both symetric and PKI style. Since its format is planned to be\r\nreferenced at a later date, the intended usage is common.\r\n\r\nAuthor/Change controller : Contact Author Anders Hansson, CTO\r\nSecured eMail, anders.hansson&securedemail.org regarding issues of technical\r\nnature. \r\n\r\n(created 08 September 2005)\r\n\r\n[]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
