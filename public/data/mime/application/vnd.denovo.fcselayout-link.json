Since the server code is proprietary, and \n   the layout data format is proprietary and contains no\n   executable code, it is unlikely that a false server could be set \n   up with hacked layouts that could cause any problems.\n\n   Although this media type does not itself contain sensitive \n   information, it in effect provides read-only access to specific \n   content in a different location. As such, the necessity of any \n   further security precautions will depend on the nature of the \n   referenced content.\n\nInteroperability considerations : Microsoft Windows \n   98/2000/NT/XP/Vista.\n\nPublished specification : N/A\n\nApplications which use this media : FCS Express.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n   1. Magic number(s) : N/A\n   2. File extension(s) : .fe_launch\n   3. Macintosh file type code : N/A\n   4. Object Identifiers: N/A\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n   1.
