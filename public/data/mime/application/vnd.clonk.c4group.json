A malicious script can cause the game to hang. It\nis also probable that a script can trick the game into executing\narbitrary instructions. The game does no integrity checking except to\nensure that all players in a network game have the same game data.\nScripts can easily change the game state of any participating player.\n\nPlayers are advised to treat C4Group files like executable files.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nWhile the c4group file uses a custom format, its contents are mostly\nfiles with common content types.\n\nPublished specification :\nhttp://wiki.nosebud.de/wiki/C4Group\n\nApplications which use this media :\nThe game Clonk, http://clonk.de\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1.
