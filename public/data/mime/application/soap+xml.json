In SOAP 1.2, it\n      serves a similar purpose as the SOAPAction HTTP header field\n      did in SOAP 1.1.  Namely, its value identifies the intent of\n      the message.\n\n      The value of the action parameter is an absolute URI-reference\n      as defined by RFC 2396 [RFC2396], which MUST be non-empty.\n      SOAP places no restrictions on the specificity of the URI or\n      that it is resolvable.  Although the purpose of the action\n      parameter is to indicate the intent of the SOAP message there\n      is no mechanism for automatically computing the value based on\n      the SOAP envelope.  In other words, the value has to be\n      determined out of band.  It is recommended that the same value\n      be used to identify sets of message types that are logically\n      connected in some manner, for example part of the same\n      \"service\".  It is strongly RECOMMENDED that the URI be globally\n      unique and stable over time.\n\n      Use of the action parameter is OPTIONAL.  SOAP Receivers MAY\n      use it as a hint to optimize processing, but SHOULD NOT require\n      its presence in order to operate.\n\nEncoding considerations: Identical to those of \"application/xml\" as\n   described in RFC 3023 [RFC3023], section 3.2, as applied to the\n   SOAP envelope infoset.\n\nSecurity considerations: Because SOAP can carry application defined\n   data whose semantics is independent from that of any MIME wrapper\n   (or context within which the MIME wrapper is used), one should not\n   expect to be able to understand the semantics of the SOAP message\n   based on the semantics of the MIME wrapper alone.
