The\ninformation contained within the media type is GPS track information, i.e.\ntimestamps and coordinates, along with some meta-data (such as track name, boat\nname, boat id, boat type, date, etc).\n\nThe media type does not need any privacy or integrity services. The information\ncarried within the media type is a GPS track from a race boat, whose movement in\nthe race course is public information anyway. Integrity of the information is\nnot an issue since a) the information is not used in making any business (or\notherwise) critical decisions (in fact it is only used for spectator purposes in\nsailing races). b) there is no immediate attack vector exposed by altering the\ninformation.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nThe format is binary.\n\nPublished specification :\nNo\n\nApplications which use this media :\nThe sailingtracker client and server.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) :\n2. File extension(s) : st\n3. Macintosh file type code :\n4. Object Identifiers:\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Heikki Vesalainen\n2.
