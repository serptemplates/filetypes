A profile does not change the semantics of\n   the resource representation when processed without profile \n   knowledge, so that clients both with and without knowledge of a \n   profiled resource can safely use the same representation. The \n   profile parameter MAY be used by clients to express their \n   preferences in the content negotiation process. If the profile \n   parameter is given, a server SHOULD return a document that honors \n   the profiles in the list which it recognizes, and MUST ignore the \n   profiles in the list which it does not recognize. It is \n   RECOMMENDED that profile URIs are dereferenceable and provide \n   useful documentation at that URI. For more information and \n   background please refer to [RFC6906].\n\n   This specification defines six values for the profile parameter.\n\n   http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#expanded\n   To request or specify expanded JSON-LD document form.\n\n   http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#compacted\n   To request or specify compacted JSON-LD document form.\n\n   http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#context\n   To request or specify a JSON-LD context document.\n\n   http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#flattened\n   To request or specify flattened JSON-LD document form.\n\n   http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#frame\n   To request or specify a JSON-LD frame document.\n\n   http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld#framed\n   To request or specify framed JSON-LD document form.\n\n   All other URIs starting with http://www.w3.org/ns/json-ld are \n   reserved for future use by JSON-LD specifications.\n\n   Other specifications may publish additional profile parameter URIs\n   with their own defined semantics. This includes the ability to \n   associate a file extension with a profile parameter.\n\n   When used as a media type parameter [RFC4288] in an HTTP Accept \n   header [RFC7231], the value of the profile parameter MUST be \n   enclosed in quotes (\") if it contains special characters such as \n   whitespace, which is required when multiple profile URIs are \n   combined.\n\n   When processing the \"profile\" media type parameter, it is \n   important to note that its value contains one or more URIs and not\n   IRIs. In some cases it might therefore be necessary to convert \n   between IRIs and URIs as specified in section 3 Relationship \n   between IRIs and URIs of [RFC3987].\n\nEncoding considerations: See RFC 8259, section 11.\n\nSecurity considerations: See RFC 8259, section 12 [RFC8259]\n\n   Since JSON-LD is intended to be a pure data exchange format for \n   directed graphs, the serialization SHOULD NOT be passed through a \n   code execution mechanism such as JavaScript's eval() function to \n   be parsed.
