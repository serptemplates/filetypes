Certain compression\n techniques employed within the binary data are licensed under patent\n 5,249,220. between the originating wireless device and its associated\n service provider. For character sets that use only 7-bits per character,\n the text must be packed using the Pack7 transfer encoding scheme defined\n by FLEXsuite(tm)\n\nSecurity considerations :\n Encyption of secure data carried by this content-type is defined\n within the licensed intellectual property.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\n This media type uses canonical encodings which precludes\n interoperability issues.\n\nPublished specification :\n The definition of this type is a part of the Wireless Instant\n Messaging Protocol (IMP) specification available from Aether\n Systems under an appropriate licensing agreement. Some\n compression techniques used within IMP are licensed under\n patent 5,249,220.\n\nApplications which use this media :\n Various wireless messaging devices and messaging infrastructure\n equipment used in 2way paging and PCS industry.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n 1.
