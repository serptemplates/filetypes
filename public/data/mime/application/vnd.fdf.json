As \n   such, its security implications are dependent on what use that \n   data is put to at both the client and the server ends. At the \n   client, the FDF data is usually combined with a PDF file and \n   presented to an end user in some form. At the server, that data \n   can be stored in databases, or fed to other applications. In all \n   cases, it is important that this data is scrutinized to prevent \n   malicious inputs from causing damage. Unlike PDF, FDF files cannot \n   be digitally signed or protected. FDF does not natively support \n   encryption. However it is possible to encrypt an entire FDF file \n   (by treating it is a binary blob) and then to embed that entire \n   encrypted blob into the EncryptedFDFs array entry of another \n   (wrapper) FDF. Encryption used by FDF for EncryptedFDFs is old and \n   limited to a weak 40-bit RC4 using MD5 hash and is thus not \n   recommended. The FDF EncryptedFDFs entry is explicitly marked as \n   deprecated from PDF 2.0 (ISO 32000-2:2020). As FDF is based on \n   PDF, it is extensible, can contain binary data or other formats - \n   see RFC 8118 for additional considerations about PDF security.\n\nInteroperability considerations: Only a single version of FDF has \n   ever been defined, which is version 1.2 that was introduced with \n   PDF 1.2. The versioning mechanism used by FDF is the same as that \n   for PDF. As described in clause 12.7.8 of ISO 32000-2:2020, the \n   first header line of an FDF file contains the FDF version number \n   which may then be overriden by the Version key of the FDF catalog \n   dictionary, should future versions be defined. See also RFC 8118 \n   for additional general considerations on PDF interoperability.\n\nPublished specification: The Forms Data Format (FDF) is defined in \n   clause 12.7.8 in \"ISO 32000-2:2020.

FDF can be used when submitting form data to a server, \n   receiving the response, and incorporating it into an interactive \n   form. It can also be used to export form and annotation data to \n   stand-alone files that can be stored, transmitted electronically, \n   and imported back into PDF files. FDF is entirely based on PDF - \n   it uses the same syntax and has essentially the same file layout \n   and structure.\n\nFragment identifier considerations: FDF itself does not have fragment \n   identifiers, but may be the target of a PDF fragment identifier. \n   Annex O of ISO 32000-2:2020 defines all PDF related fragment \n   identifiers. Table Annex O.4 defines the \"fdf\" PDF open parameter \n   which takes a relative or absolute URI argument to an FDF file. \n   This opens the PDF document and then imports data from the \n   specified FDF file.
