    "template_text": "(last updated 14 December 2006)\r\n\r\nName : Michael Ashbridge\r\n\r\nEmail : mashbridge+iana&google.com\r\n\r\nMIME media type name : Application\r\n\r\nMIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.google-earth.kml+xml\r\n\r\nRequired parameters : None\r\n\r\nOptional parameters :\r\nNone\r\n\r\nEncoding considerations : 8bit\r\n\r\nSecurity considerations :\r\n\r\nThe KML media type is a XML-based plain-text format. It cannot contain active \r\nor executable content. The information contained in the KML media type does \r\nnot require privacy or integrity services. \r\n\r\nInteroperability considerations :\r\nThere are no special interoperability issues. KML files are simple plain-text \r\nfiles. \r\n\r\nPublished specification :\r\nA specification and reference for KML may be found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://earth.google.com/kml/\r\n\r\nApplications which use this media :\r\nThe KML filetype was designed for use in, and first implemented by, the Google \r\nEarth geospatial browser. More information on Google Earth can be found at:\r\n\r\nhttp://earth.google.com/\r\n\r\nSeveral other applications that provide some amount of KML support at this \r\ntime, and it is expected that several will soon do so in the near future. \r\nAmongst these are:\r\n\r\nSketchUp ( http://sketchup.com/ )\r\nNASA World Wind ( http://worldwind.arc.nasa.gov/ )\r\nESRI ArcGIS Explorer ( http://www.esri.com/software/arcgis/explorer/ )\r\n\r\n\r\nAdditional information :\r\n\r\n1. Magic number(s) : NONE\r\n2. File extension(s) : kml\r\n3. Macintosh file type code : GKml\r\n4. Object Identifiers: NONE\r\n\r\nKML is an acronym for Keyhole Markup Langage, which stems from the time before \r\nthe Keyhole Corporation was acquried by Google, and their Keyhole application \r\nredesigned and rebranded as Google Earth.\r\n\r\nKML is an XML-based file format and grammar for modeling and storing \r\ngeographic features such as points, lines, images, and polygons for display in \r\na geospatial browser.\r\n\r\nPerson to contact for further information :\r\n\r\n1. Name : Michael Ashbridge\r\n2. Email : mashbridge+iana&google.com\r\n\r\nIntended usage : Common\r\nIt is not unreasonable to expect that the use of KML files will be comparable \r\nto the use of PDF files.\r\n\r\nAuthor/Change controller : Michael Ashbridge\r\n\r\n\r\n(file created 14 December 2006)"
