See section 8 of RFC 3236 for additional information about how \nthis parameter was defined.\n\nEncoding considerations : binary\n\nSecurity considerations :\nThe considerations for \"text/html\" as specified in \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/html and for 'application/xml' as specified in [RFC \n7303], also hold for 'application/xhtml+xml'.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nRules for processing both conforming and non-conforming content are \ndefined in http://www.w3.org/TR/html.\n\n\nPublished specification :\nLabeling a resource with the application/xhtml+xml type asserts that the \nresource is an XML document that likely has a root element from the HTML \nnamespace. Thus, the relevant specifications are the XML specification, \nthe Namespaces in XML specification, and http://www.w3.org/TR/html.\n\nApplications which use this media :\nWeb browsers, tools for processing Web content, HTML authoring tools, \nsearch engines, validators.\n\nFragment identifier considerations :\nSame as for application/xml [RFC7303]\n\nRestrictions on usage :\nNo restrictions apply.\n\nProvisional registration? (standards tree only) :\nNo.\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Deprecated alias names for this type : N/A\n2. Magic number(s) : No sequence of bytes can uniquely identify an XHTML \ndocument. More information on detecting XHTML documents is available in \nthe MIME Sniffing specification.\n3. File extension(s) : \"xhtml\" and \"xht\" are sometimes used.\n4. Macintosh file type code : TEXT\n5. Object Identifiers: N/A\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Robin Berjon\n2.
