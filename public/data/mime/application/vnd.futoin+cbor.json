The semantics of\n   a specific interface utilizing the media type are not specified by\n   the media type itself.\n\n   As a consequence:\n\n   1. Even though active or executable content may be encapsulated by\n   users, it is discouraged. A general-purpose client or server must \n   never try to execute any code found in the payload.\n\n   2. The privacy of all messages employing this media type should be \n   maintained by the peer-to-peer communications layer; there is no \n   mechanism in the media type itself that provides privacy \n   protection.\n\n   2.1. There is no strict requirement for data privacy protection of \n   a generic message. However, interface specifications that employ \n   this media type may impose such restrictions on a case-by-case \n   basis.\n\n   2.2. There is an optional extensible message integrity mechanism \n   based on the \"sec\" message field.\n\n   3. There are a number of mechanisms external to this media type \n   that can used to require and/or provide additional security:\n\n   3.1. Optional \"SecureChannel\" interface constraint as defined in \n   FTN3. This can be used to to insure that transmission occurs over \n   a channel that provides both data privacy and data integrity \n   protection. Modern TLS, VPN, or similar technologies can be used \n   to meet this requirement. All peers involved in the communication \n   must reject processing if this requirement is not fulfilled.\n\n   3.2. Optional \"MessageSignature\" interface constraint as defined \n   in FTN3. This can be used to require that each message be signed \n   by strong Message Authentication Code or equal. All peers involved\n   in the communication must reject processing if:\n\n      a) this requirement is not fulfilled,\n      b) and/or \"sec\" field coding format is not supported,\n      c) and/or signature verification fails.\n\n   3.3. Unless optional \"AllowAnonymous\" interface requirement as \n   defined in FTN3 is set, request message processing peer (Executor \n   as in FTN3) must require some type of client authentication. \n   Otherwise, processing of such requests must be rejected.\n\n   Additionally, this media type inherits security considerations \n   from RFC 8949: Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR).",
