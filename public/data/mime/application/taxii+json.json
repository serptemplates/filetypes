See [RFC8259].\n\nSecurity considerations: These considerations are, in part, derived \n   from Section 9 of the Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information \n   Exchange [RFC8322].\n\n   This document defines a resource-oriented approach for exchanging \n   cyber threat intelligence using HTTP [RFC7230] over TLS [RFC5246] \n   and the JSON [RFC8259] Format. As such, implementers must \n   understand the security considerations described in those \n   specifications.\n\n   Security considerations relating to the generation and consumption \n   of TAXII messages are similar to application/json and are \n   discussed in Section 12 of [RFC8259].\n\n   The discovery API contains one or multiple URLs, therefor the \n   security considerations stated in Section 6 of [RFC1738] should be \n   consulted especially in regard to parsing relative URLs and \n   attempts of path traversal.\n\n   Documents of \"application/taxii+json\" are simply request and \n   response messages for an RPC like mechanism for searching, \n   uploading and downloading Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) \n   documents, most commonly STIX. The documents only contain metadata \n   about the TAXII server, such as descriptions, versions of CTI or \n   status response of the request. Documents do not contain active or \n   executable content.\n\n   Unicode is used to represent text such as descriptions in the \n   format. The considerations documented by Unicode Technical Report \n   #36: Unicode Security Considerations [UNICODE] should be taken \n   into account.\n\n   To protect the confidentiality of a given resource provided by a \n   TAXII implementation, requests for retrieval of a resource need to \n   be authenticated to prevent unauthorized users from accessing the \n   resource. It can also be useful to log and audit access to \n   sensitive resources to verify that proper access controls remain \n   in place over time.\n\n   Access control to content made available using TAXII should use \n   mechanisms that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the \n   information. While the primitive authentication mechanism of HTTP \n   Basic Authentication [RFC7617] is mandatory to implement for \n   base-level interoperability it is rarely appropriate for sensitive \n   information. A number of authentication schemes are defined in the \n   \"HTTP Authentication Schemes\" registry at IANA [IANA AUTH]. Of \n   these, HTTP Origin-Bound Authentication (HOBA) [RFC7486] and \n   SCRAM-SHA-256 [RFC7804] (\"SCRAM\" stands for \"Salted Challenge \n   Response Authentication Mechanism\") provide improved security \n   properties over HTTP Basic [RFC7617] and Digest [RFC7616] \n   authentication schemes. However, sharing communities that are \n   engaged in sensitive collaborative analysis and/or operational \n   response for indicators and incidents targeting high-value \n   information systems should adopt a suitably stronger user \n   authentication solution, such as a risk-based or multi-factor \n   approach.\n\n   Collaborating consortiums may benefit from the adoption of a \n   federated identity solution, such as those based upon OAuth \n   [RFC6749] with the JSON Web Token (JWT) [RFC7797], or SAML-core \n   [SAML-core] (\"SAML\" stands for \"Security Assertion Markup \n   Language\"), SAML-bind [SAML-bind], and SAML-prof [SAML-prof] for \n   web-based authentication and cross-organizational single sign-on. \n   Dependency on a trusted third-party identity provider implies that \n   appropriate care must be exercised to sufficiently secure the \n   identity provider. Any attacks on the federated identity system \n   would present a risk to the consortium, as a relying party. \n   Potential mitigations include deployment of a federation-aware \n   identity provider that is under the control of the \n   information-sharing consortium, with suitably stringent technical \n   and management controls.\n\n   It is recommended that all TAXII servers authenticate and \n   authorize access to all collection data on a per-client basis \n   using robust security methods. While this specification defines \n   HTTP Basic as a minimum suggested authentication mechanism, more \n   advanced security authentication methods are recommended when \n   products or deployments require stronger authentication and \n   authorization frameworks for accessing or posting data to the \n   TAXII server.\n\n   Authorization of resource representations is the responsibility of \n   the source system, i.e., based on the authenticated user identity \n   associated with an HTTP(S) request. The required authorization \n   policies that are to be enforced must therefore be managed by the \n   security administrators of the source system. Various \n   authorization architectures would be suitable for this purpose, \n   such as Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) [NIST RBAC] and/or \n   Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC), as embodied in the \n   eXtensible Access Control Markup Language (XACML) [XACML]. In \n   particular, implementers adopting XACML may benefit from the \n   capability to represent their authorization policies in a \n   standardized, interoperable format. Note that implementers are \n   free to choose any suitable authorization mechanism that is \n   capable of fulfilling the policy enforcement requirements relevant \n   to their consortium and/or organization.\n\n   While the authentication and confidentiality for the TAXII session \n   is done at a lower level via the transport mechanism (HTTPS), this \n   does not obviate the consumer (server or client) from validating \n   the format and contents of the documents sent in a session. This \n   validation should includes checking various limits, such as \n   document size limits, to limit the risk of the other party \n   attempting to attack the service.\n\n   Additional security requirements such as enforcing message-level \n   security at the destination system could supplement the security \n   enforcements performed at the source system; however, these \n   destination-provided policy enforcements are out of scope for this \n   specification. Implementers requiring this capability should \n   consider leveraging, for example, the <RIDPolicy> element in the \n   RID schema. Refer to Section 9 of [RFC6545] for more information. \n   Additionally, the underlying JSON serialization used in the \n   representation can offer encryption and message authentication \n   capabilities. For example, JSON Web Encryption [RFC7516] and JSON \n   Web Signature [RFC7515], can provide such mechanisms.\n\n   TAXII Servers may manage response volume in different ways. \n   Implementers should be aware that a search request may return more \n   objects than is prudent to return in a single HTTP Response. To \n   mitigate this, TAXII servers should consider implementing \n   restrictions on the number of objects it will return in a single \n   HTTP response.\n\n   TAXII provides clients a rich set of filtering and query options \n   to return specific results from repositories of CTI data. As such, \n   TAXII servers should implement protections against queries that \n   can potentially consume a significant amount of resources and \n   prevent the server from functioning in a normal way.\n\n   TAXII defines an optional error message that may contain sensitive \n   application data. Implementers should ensure that they do not leak \n   descriptive text or application return codes for things that a \n   user may not have access to, for example, leak info about the \n   existence of something, implementation of something, vs. just not \n   having access.\n\n   Note: Despite TAXII searching and returning STIX objects, this \n   format does not encapsulate any CTI content. It is expected that \n   CTI documents will be sent with the appropriate mime-type. For \n   these, consult their own security consideration sections.\n\n   [NEW] As the next URL parameter is a client provided property, \n   care must be taken that it is not blindly trusted as the same \n   value that the server returned as part of the TAXII Envelope. This \n   means it MUST NOT be implicitly trusted, and the value MUST be \n   reevaluated in the context of the provided query such that \n   incorrect data (data that the client is not authorized to have or \n   not part of the query set) is not returned.\n\n   Privacy considerations:\n\n   These considerations are, in part, derived from Section 10 of the \n   Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information Exchange [RFC8322].\n\n   The documents contain various descriptions and other text. There \n   is no expectation that these will contain private information, but\n   as some may be user-provided, there is no guarantee that a user \n   will not inadvertently include private data. It is expected that \n   the client or server authenticate the other party through the \n   transport mechanism before sending any possible private data. As \n   the protocol is about sharing data, it is expected that the \n   parties understand their obligations in keeping relevant data \n   private.\n\n   Adoption of the information-sharing approach described in this \n   document will enable users to more easily perform correlations \n   across separate, and potentially unrelated, cybersecurity \n   information providers. A client may succeed in assembling a data \n   set that would not have been permitted within the context of the \n   authorization policies of either provider when considered \n   individually. Thus, providers may face a risk of an attacker \n   obtaining access that constitutes an undetected separation of \n   duties (SOD) violation. It is important to note that this risk is \n   not unique to this specification, and a similar potential for \n   abuse exists with any other cybersecurity information-sharing \n   protocol. However, the wide availability of tools for HTTP clients \n   implies that the resources and technical skills required for a \n   successful exploit may be less than it was previously. This risk \n   can be best mitigated through appropriate vetting of the client at \n   the time of account provisioning. In addition, any increase in the \n   risk of this type of abuse should be offset by the corresponding \n   increase in effectiveness that this specification affords to the \n   defenders.\n\n   Overall, privacy concerns in TAXII can be mitigated by following \n   security considerations and by the careful use of the content \n   exchanged via TAXII.\n\nInteroperability considerations: The TAXII specification specifies \n   the format of conforming messages and the interpretation thereof. \n   In addition, the OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical \n   Committee has defined interoperability tests to ensure conforming \n   products and solutions can exchange TAXII documents.",

This \n   means it MUST NOT be implicitly trusted, and the value MUST be \n   reevaluated in the context of the provided query such that \n   incorrect data (data that the client is not authorized to have or \n   not part of the query set) is not returned.\n\n   Privacy considerations:\n\n   These considerations are, in part, derived from Section 10 of the \n   Resource-Oriented Lightweight Information Exchange [RFC8322].\n\n   The documents contain various descriptions and other text. There \n   is no expectation that these will contain private information, but\n   as some may be user-provided, there is no guarantee that a user \n   will not inadvertently include private data. It is expected that \n   the client or server authenticate the other party through the \n   transport mechanism before sending any possible private data. As \n   the protocol is about sharing data, it is expected that the \n   parties understand their obligations in keeping relevant data \n   private.\n\n   Adoption of the information-sharing approach described in this \n   document will enable users to more easily perform correlations \n   across separate, and potentially unrelated, cybersecurity \n   information providers. A client may succeed in assembling a data \n   set that would not have been permitted within the context of the \n   authorization policies of either provider when considered \n   individually. Thus, providers may face a risk of an attacker \n   obtaining access that constitutes an undetected separation of \n   duties (SOD) violation. It is important to note that this risk is \n   not unique to this specification, and a similar potential for \n   abuse exists with any other cybersecurity information-sharing \n   protocol. However, the wide availability of tools for HTTP clients \n   implies that the resources and technical skills required for a \n   successful exploit may be less than it was previously. This risk \n   can be best mitigated through appropriate vetting of the client at \n   the time of account provisioning. In addition, any increase in the \n   risk of this type of abuse should be offset by the corresponding \n   increase in effectiveness that this specification affords to the \n   defenders.\n\n   Overall, privacy concerns in TAXII can be mitigated by following \n   security considerations and by the careful use of the content \n   exchanged via TAXII.\n\nInteroperability considerations: The TAXII specification specifies \n   the format of conforming messages and the interpretation thereof. \n   In addition, the OASIS Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) Technical \n   Committee has defined interoperability tests to ensure conforming \n   products and solutions can exchange TAXII documents.\n\nPublished specification:\n\n   TAXII Version 2.1 OASIS Committee Specification 01\n\n   http://docs.oasis-open.org/cti/taxii/v2.1/cs01/taxii-v2.1-cs01.html\n\n   Cited in the \"OASIS Standards\" document:\n\n   https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#oasiscommiteespecs, from\n\n   https://www.oasis-open.org/standards#taxii2.1\n\nApplications which use this media: TAXII is an application layer \n   protocol for the communication of cyber threat information \n   including STIX in a simple and scalable manner.\n\nFragment identifier considerations: None\n\nRestrictions on usage: None\n\nAdditional information:\n\n   1.
