Even though they operate within the\nconfines of the glyph outline conversion system and have\nno access outside the font rendering machinery, hint\ninstructions can be, however, quite complex, and a\nmaliciously designed complex font could cause undue\nresource consumption (e.g. memory or CPU cycles) on a\nmachine interpreting it.
