Thus, a URN of a SMPTE Universal Label can use the OID URN\nnamespace specified in [RFC3061], or any other future URN namespace\nthat is appropriate for SMPTE Universal Labels.\n\nNote that, per [RFC2045], some characters (including the comma used\nto separate multiple values) require that the entire parameter value\nbe enclosed in quotes.\n\nBelow is an example of use of the optional parameter.  The two SMPTE\nUniversal Labels indicate that the MXF file uses the OP1a Operational\nPattern and contains IEC DV video at 25 Mbps, 525 lines, 59.94 fps\ninterlaced essence.\n\n   Content-Type:  application/mxf;\n      ULs=\"urn:oid:1.3.52.4.1.1.1.13.1.2.1.1.1,\n      urn:oid:1.3.52.4.1.1.1.4.1.2.2.2.1.1\"\n\nEncoding considerations: binary\n\nSecurity considerations: Application/mxf objects are not signed but\nmay be partially encrypted internally.
