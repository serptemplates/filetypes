(www.automationml.org)\n\nGeneral Comments: The goal of the AutomationML e.V. (association) is \n   the dissemination and further development of the AutomationML data \n   format as an open, neutral and free industrial standard for the \n   cross-company and interdisciplinary exchange of planning data for \n   plants in the manufacturing and process industry.\n\n"
