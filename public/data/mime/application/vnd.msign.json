The protocol\nmessages themselves contain no mechanisms to protect the integrity or\nconfidentiality of the contents, such that a transport via SSL or \nS/MIME is strongly recommended.\n\nNo msign message contains \"executable\" information of any kind.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nThe Mobile Electronic Signature Consortium sets up a compliance\ntesting process to ensure interoperability of complying products.\n\nPublished specification :\nThe specification is not public at this time.\n\nApplications which use this media :\nThis media type is used by applications implementing the msign\nprotocol. The purpose of the msign protocol is to request signatures \nfrom a mobile device.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) :\n2. File extension(s) :\n3.
