    "template_text": "(registered 2014-07-25, last updated 2014-07-25)\n\nName : William Stevenson\n\nEmail : wstevenson&maxmind.com\n\nMIME media type name : Application\n\nMIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.maxmind.maxmind-db\n\nRequired parameters : N/A\n\nOptional parameters : \nN/A\n\nEncoding considerations : binary\n\n\nSecurity considerations : \nThis format is not designed to contain any sort of active content. However, given that the format can contain strings of arbitrary size, nothing would prevent someone from storing code, file paths, URLs, etc. The interpretation of a given string field is left up to the consumer of a database in their own code.\n\nThis media type does not employ any compression scheme. Files can be compressed with standard tools such as gzip.\n\nWe do not expect files in this format to typically contain sensitive content. However, as mentioned above, this format can contain arbitrary strings. Providers of MaxMind DB files are encouraged to carefully consider whether any of the data they are storing in the database needs additional protection.\n\nInteroperability considerations : \nThis file format is capable of storing 64- and 128-bit unsigned integers. Implementers of parsers for this format should take this into consideration. For platforms without native integers of this size, the results can be stored as strings or some other appropriate representation. Nothing in this format should prevent its use across all platforms.\n\nPublished specification : \nhttp://maxmind.github.io/MaxMind-DB/\n\nApplications which use this media : \nMaxMind provides free software implementations of MaxMind DB readers in Perl, Python, PHP, C, C#, and Java. There are also a number of independent projects which implement readers for this type, including some for Elixir, Erlang, Go, node.js, Ruby, Rust and Scala.\n\nFragment identifier considerations :\nN/A\n\nRestrictions on usage :\nFiles of the application/vnd.maxmind.maxmind-db type will generally be created by MaxMind and consumed by APIs MaxMind has written. However, with the published specification, others may write their own database files in the MMDB format or write their own APIs to consume MMDB files.\n\nProvisional registration? (standards tree only) :\nN/A\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Deprecated alias names for this type : N/A\n2. Magic number(s) : N/A\n3. File extension(s) : .mmdb\n4. Macintosh file type code : N/A\n5. Object Identifiers: N/A\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : William Stevenson\n2. Email : dev&maxmind.com\n\nIntended usage : Common\nTo provide information about an IP address such as its geolocation, the ISP to which it has been allocated, or the type of user associated with the address.\n\nAuthor/Change controller : Thomas Mather"
