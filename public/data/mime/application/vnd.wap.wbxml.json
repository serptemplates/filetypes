The charset\nparameter MAY, however, be used to provide protocol-specific\noperations, such as charset-based content negotiation in WSP [WSP] and\nHTTP [RFC-2068]. The recommended value is the same as recommended for\nthe text/xml media type in [RFC-2376]; that is, \"UTF-8\" [RFC-2279],\nrepresenting the UTF-8 charset.\n\nThe charset parameter can be used by WBXML processors to determine\nauthoritatively the character encoding of the WBXML entity.\n\nIf an application/wbxml entity is received where the charset parameter\nis omitted, and the charset attribute in the binary XML format\nindicates an unknown character set, the default encoding of \"UTF-8\"\nshould be assumed.\n\nThe level parameter indicates the version. The value has the format:\n<major>.<minor>; where major and minor are integers. For example,\nlevel=\"1.1\" indicates version 1.1.\n\nEncoding considerations:\n\nThis is binary material and suitable encoding must be used when\ntransferring over protocols that cannot handle binary.\n\nSecurity considerations:\n\nAs a binary XML format, WBXML has the same security considerations as\nspecified in [RFC-2376].\n\nInteroperability considerations:\n\nThe WAP Forum Ltd.
