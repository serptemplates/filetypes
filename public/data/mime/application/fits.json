No\nother constraints are placed on the content of a file described as\n\"application/fits\".\n\nA FITS file described with the media type \"application/fits\" may have\nan arbitrary number of conforming extension header and data units\n(XHDUs) that follow its mandatory primary header and data unit\n(PHDU). The XHDUs may be one of the standard types (\"IMAGE\",\n\"TABLE\", and \"BINTABLE\") or any other type that satisfies the\n\"Requirements for Conforming Extensions\" (section 4.4.1 of [NOST]).\nThe PHDU or any \"IMAGE\" XHDU may contain zero to 999 dimensions with\nzero or more pixels along each dimension.\n\nThe PHDU may use the random groups convention, in which the dimension\nof the first axis is zero and the keywords GROUPS, PCOUNT and GCOUNT\nappear in the header. NAXIS1=0 and GROUPS=T is the signature of\nrandom groups; see section 7 of the Definition of FITS paper [NOST].\n\nRecommendations for application writers:\n\nAn application intended to handle \"application/fits\" SHOULD be able\nto provide a user with a manifest of all of the HDUs that are present\nin the file and with all of the keyword/value pairs from each of the\nHDUs.\n\nAn application intended to handle \"application/fits\" SHOULD be\nprepared to encounter XHDUs that contain either ASCII or binary\ntables, and to provide a user with access to their elements.\n\nAn application which can modify FITS files or retrieve FITS files\nfrom an external service SHOULD be capable of writing such files to a\nlocal storage medium.\n\nComplete interpretation of the meaning and intended use of the data\nin each of the HDUs typically requires the use of heuristics that\nattempt to ascertain which local conventions were used by the author\nof the FITS file.\n\nAs examples, files with media type \"application/fits\" might contain\nany of the following contents:\n\n- An empty PHDU (containing zero data elements) followed by a table\nHDU that contains a catalog of celestial objects.\n\n- An empty PHDU followed by a table HDU that encodes a series of\ntime-tagged photon events from an exposure using an X-ray detector.\n\n- An empty PHDU followed by a series of IMAGE HDUs containing data\nfrom an exposure taken by a mosaic of CCD detectors.\n\n- An empty PHDU followed by a series of table HDUs that contain a\nsnapshot of the state of a relational database.\n\n- A PHDU containing a single image along with keyword/value pairs of\nmetadata.\n\n- A PHDU with NAXIS1=0 and GROUPS=T followed by random groups data\nrecords of complex fringe visibilities\n\nMagic number(s): \"SIMPLE = T\"\n\nJeff Uphoff of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) has\ncontributed database entries for the magic number file which is used\nby the Unix \"file\" command. Magic number files with these entries\nare distributed with a variety of Unix-like operating systems. In\naddition to recognizing a FITS file using the string given above, the\nUphoff entries also recognize the data type of the pixels in the\nPHDU.\n\nFile extension(s): fits\n\nThis file extension SHOULD NOT be interpreted as a prescription.\n\nThe FITS standard originated in the era when files were stored and\nexchanged via magnetic tape; it does not prescribe any nomenclature\nfor files on disk. Various sites within the FITS community have\nlong-established practices where files are presumed to be FITS by\ncontext. File extensions used at such sites commonly indicate\ncontent of the file instead of the data format.\n\nIn the absence of other information it is reasonably safe to presume\nthat a file name ending in \".fits\" is intended to be a FITS file.\nNevertheless, there are other commonly used extensions; e.g., \".fit\",\n\".fts\", and many others not suitable for listing in a media type\nregistration.\n\nIntended usage: Common\n\nPersons to contact for further information:\n\n\"Steve Allen\" <sla&ucolick.org>\n\"Don Wells\" <dwells&nrao.edu>\n\nAuthor/Change controller:\n\n\"Steve Allen\" <sla&ucolick.org>\n\nThe IAU FITS Working Group may authorize changes to this document.\n"
