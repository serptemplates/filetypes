Optional parameters: charset parameter (see definition of charset\nparameter for application/xml, RFC 3023). The allowed values are:\n\"utf-8\" [RFC2279] and \"utf-16\" [RFC2781]. In the absence of the\ncharset parameter, UTF-8 and UTF-16 are differentiated by the\nprocedure described in [XML 4.3.3].\n\n[XML 4.3.3] Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition). W3C\nRecommendation 26 November 2008. 4.3.3 Character Encoding in Entities.\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charencoding\n\n5. Encoding considerations: binary\n\n6. Security considerations:\n\nThe general utility of this media type to the Internet community is in\nthe area of remote user interfaces for devices and services that use\nInternet-based technologies, in particular the Universal Remote\nConsole (URC) technology (ISO/IEC 24752). A Grouping Sheet contains a\ngrouping structure for a remote user interface that is based on URC\ntechnology.\n\nThe basic (standardized) format of information contained in the media\ntype does not carry active or executable content.\n\nFor the protection of the privacy and integrity of a grouping sheet,\nISO/IEC 24752-5:2013 section 9.8 explicitly encourages vendors and\nplatform carriers to consider employment of privacy and integrity\nservices such as transport security. However, concrete measures in\nthis regard are outside the scope of this standard.\n\nSee also the security considerations described in section 10 of RFC\n3023.\n\n7. Interoperability considerations: Same as interoperability\nconsiderations of text/xml as specified in RFC 3023.\n\n8. Published specification: ISO/IEC 24752-5:2013 (currently in FDIS\nvote)\n\n9. Applications which use this media type: Universal Remote Console\nclients, i.e. software and hardware for the purpose of remote control\nof devices and services.\n\n10. Additional information:\n\nMagic number(s): Same as magic number(s) of text/xml as specified in\nRFC 3023. File extension(s): .gsheet Macintosh file type code(s): not\nassigned Object Identifier(s) or OID(s): not assigned\n\n11. Intended usage: COMMON\n\n12. Other Information/General Comment:\n\n13. Person to contact for further information: Name: Gottfried\nZimmermann E-mail: gzimmermann&acm.org Author/change controller:\nISO/IEC 24752-5 is an international standard by ISO/IEC JTC1 SC35,\nwith editor Gottfried Zimmermann. ISO/IEC JTC1 SC35 has change control\nover ISO/IEC 24752-5."
