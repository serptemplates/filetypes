An (invalid) document may contain code \n   that, when executed, could lead to unexpected side effects \n   compromising the security of a system.\n\n   WoT Thing Descriptions can be evaluated with a JSON-LD 1.1 \n   processor, which typically follows links to remote contexts (i.e.,\n   TD context extensions, see W3C WoT Thing Description, section 7) \n   automatically, resulting in the transfer of files without the \n   explicit request of the Consumer for each one. If remote contexts \n   are served by third parties, it may allow them to gather usage \n   patterns or similar information leading to privacy concerns. While\n   implementations on resource-constrained devices are expected to \n   perform raw JSON processing (as opposed to JSON-LD processing), \n   implementations in general SHOULD statically cache vetted versions\n   of their supported context extensions and not to follow links to \n   remote contexts. Supported context extensions can be managed \n   through a secure software update mechanism instead.\n\n   Context Extensions (see W3C WoT Thing Description, section 7) that\n   are loaded from the Web over non-secure connections, such as HTTP,\n   run the risk of being altered by an attacker such that they may \n   modify the TD Information Model in a way that could compromise \n   security. For this reason, Consumer again SHOULD vet and cache \n   remote contexts before allowing the system to use it.\n\n   Given that JSON-LD processing usually includes the substitution of\n   long IRIs [RFC3987] with short terms, WoT Thing Descriptions may \n   expand considerably when processed using a JSON-LD 1.1 processor \n   and, in the worst case, the resulting data might consume all of \n   the recipient's resources.
