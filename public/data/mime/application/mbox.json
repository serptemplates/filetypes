The default\nvalue for the \"format\" parameter is \"default\", and refers to the\nformatting rules defined in Appendix A of this memo. mbox databases\nthat do not have a \"format\" parameter SHOULD be interpreted as having\nthe implicit \"format\" value of \"default\". mbox databases that have\nan unknown value for the \"format\" parameter SHOULD be treated as\nopaque data objects, as if the media type had been specified as\napplication/octet-stream. Additional values for the format parameter\nare to be defined in subsequent specifications, and registered with\nIANA.\n\nEncoding considerations: If an email client receives an mbox database\nas a message attachment, and then stores that attachment within a\nlocal mbox database, the contents of the two database files may\nbecome irreversibly intermingled, such that both databases are\nrendered unrecognizable.
