If\nthe content needs to be protected it must be secured through external means.\n\nThere are no other known security considerations, but a security\nanalysis was not performed.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nNone known; same as for ZIP files.\n\nPublished specification :\nSpecification is not published. MGP file is essentially an offline copy\nof a segment of a MapGuide DBXML repository, along with a manifest\ncontaining instructions on how to load the XML and binary data into the\nserver.\n\nApplications which use this media :\nMapGuide Packages are used by OSGeo MapGuide Open Source, OSGeo MapGuide\nMaestro, Autodesk MapGuide Studio and Autodesk MapGuide Enterprise\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : n/a\n2. File extension(s) : .mgp\n3. Macintosh file type code : n/a\n4. Object Identifiers: n/a\n\nThis application is being made on behalf of the MapGuide Open Source\nProject Steering Committee, which operates under the umbrella of the\nOpen Source Geospatial Foundation. Information on the MapGuide Open\nSource project may be found at http://mapguide.osgeo.org/\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Jason Birch\n2. Email : jason.birch&osgeo.org\n\nIntended usage : Common\nIntended to be used on webservers hosting .mgp files for download, and\non local PCs for associating .mgp files with the client editing/upload\ntools.\n\nAuthor/Change controller : Jason Birch\n\n(file created 2010-07-20)"
