    "template_text": "(RFC 4267 published November 2005, subtype last updated November 2005)\n\nMIME media type name: application\n\nMIME subtype names: srgs\n\nRequired parameters: none\n\nOptional parameters: none\n\nEncoding Considerations\n\nThe ABNF Form of SRGS follows the character encoding handling defined\nfor XML: an ABNF grammar processor must accept both the UTF-8 and\nUTF-16 encodings of ISO/IEC 10646 and may support other character\nencodings.\n\nInteroperability Considerations\n\nThere are no known interoperability issues.\n\nPublished Specifications\n\nSpeech Recognition Grammar Specification Version 1.0 [SRGS]\n\nApplications That Use This Media Type\n\nVarious SRGS implementations use this media type.\n\nSecurity Considerations\n\nSeveral instructions in SRGS may cause arbitrary URIs to be\ndereferenced. In this case, the security issues of [RFC3986],\nsection 7, should be considered.\n\nIn addition, because of the extensibility features of SRGS, it is\npossible that the registered media types may describe content that\nhas security implications beyond those described here. However, if\nthe processor follows only the normative semantics of the\nspecifications, this content will be ignored. Only in the case where\nthe processor recognizes and processes the additional content, or\nwhere further processing of that content is dispatched to other\nprocessors, would security issues potentially arise. In that case,\nthey would fall outside the domain of this registration document.\n\nAdditional Information\n\nMagic Numbers\n\nThe ABNF self-identifying header must be present in any legal stand-\nalone ABNF Form grammar document. The first character of an ABNF\ndocument must be the \"#\" symbol (x23) unless preceded by an optional\nXML 1.0 byte order mark. The ABNF byte order mark follows the XML\ndefinition and requirements. For example, documents encoded in UTF-\n16 must begin with the byte order mark. The optional byte order mark\nand required \"#\" symbol must be followed immediately by the exact\nstring \"ABNF\" (x41 x42 x4d x46) or the appropriate equivalent for the\ndocument's encoding (e.g., for UTF-16 little-endian: x23 x00 x41 x00\nx42 x00 x4d x00 x46 x00). If the byte order mark is absent on a\ngrammar encoded in UTF-16, then the grammar processor should perform\nauto-detection of character encoding in a manner analogous to auto-\ndetection of character encoding in XML. Next follows a single-space\ncharacter (x20) and the required version number, which is \"1.0\" for\nthis specification (x31 x2e x30).\n\nFile Extensions\n\n.gram\n\nMacintosh File Type Code\n\n\"TEXT\"\n\nPerson and Email Address to Contact for Further Information\n\nWorld Wide Web Consortium <web-human&w3.org>\n\nIntended Usage\n\nCOMMON\n\nChange Controller\n\nThe SRGS specification is a work product of the World Wide Web\nConsortium's Voice Browser Working Group. The W3C has change control\nover the SRGS specification."
