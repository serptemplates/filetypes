    "encoding_considerations": "Security considerations: Evidence appraisal is at the core of any attestation protocol flow that delivers Evidence to a Verifier. The Attester may be required to provide Evidence as a condition for gaining access to resources, networks, or services. Attester Evidence therefore needs to be authentic, and integrity protected so that Verifiers can perform appraisals that accurately represent the security posture of the Attester. Any mistake in the appraisal process could have security implications. For instance, it could lead to the subversion of an access control function, which creates a chance for privilege escalation.\n\nTherefore, the Attester’s code and configuration, especially those that collect and protect Evidence, are primary security assets that must be built and maintained as securely as possible.\n\nThe protection of the Attester system should be considered throughout its entire lifecycle, from design to operation. This includes the following aspects:\n\n• Minimizing implementation complexity (see also Section 6.1 of [I-D.ietf-rats-endorsements]);\n\n• Using memory-safe programming languages;\n\n• Using secure defaults;\n\n• Minimizing the attack surface by avoiding unnecessary features that could be exploited by attackers;\n\n• Applying the principle of least privilege to the system's users;\n\n• Minimizing the potential impact of security breaches by implementing separation of duties in both the software and operational architecture;\n\n• Conducting regular, automated audits and reviews of the system, such as ensuring that users' privileges are correctly configured and that any new code has been audited and approved by independent parties;\n\n• Failing securely in the event of errors to avoid compromising the security of the system.\nThe integrity of public and private key material and the secrecy of private key material must always be ensured. This includes key material carried in attestation Evidence and key material used to verify the authority of Evidence (such as public keys that identify trusted Verifiers). For more detailed information on protecting Trust Anchors, refer to Section 12.4 of [RFC9334].\n\nThe Attester should use cryptographically protected, mutually authenticated secure channels when supplying Evidence to Verifiers to avoid man-in-the-middle attacks. Also consider minimizing the use of intermediaries: each intermediary becomes another party that needs to be trusted and therefore factored in the Attesters TCBs.
