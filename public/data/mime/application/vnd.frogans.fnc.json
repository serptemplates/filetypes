It was registered in \r\n   2006 to work with version 3.0 of the Frogans Network System \r\n   Language (FNSL) technical specification. But the use of a media \r\n   type for the distribution of FNC documents on the Internet was \r\n   determined to be unsatisfactory because using a media type from a \r\n   Web page to launch another application did not always work, \r\n   especially on mobile devices.
