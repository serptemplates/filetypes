    "template_text": "(last updated 2012-09-19)\n\nMIME media type name : Application\n\nMIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.cyan.dean.root+xml\n\nRequired parameters : None.\n\nOptional parameters : None.\n\nEncoding considerations : 8bit (UTF-8 character set)\n\nSecurity considerations :\n\nNOTE: the root in the subtype name refers to the root of the Dean\nresource tree not the superuser.\n\nMinimal security implications.\n\nThe media type is only intended for exchange over secure https transport\nstreams, which provide the necessary privacy and integrity protection.\n\nIn order for our Dean server to provide as RESTful an API as possible,\nits root resource representation is a hypermedia document linking to all\nthe resources supported by the server. This enables discovery/HATEOAS,\nbut exposes endpoints that might otherwise be unknown to an attacker.\n\nThe media type does not employ active or executable content. It is XML\nbased and does not use compression. There are of course issues implied\nby bugs in complex XML handling libraries...\n\nInteroperability considerations :\n\n\nPublished specification :\nAvailable to Cyan customers and integrators on request.\n\nApplications which use this media :\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : None\n2. File extension(s) : xml\n3. Macintosh file type code : None\n4. Object Identifiers: None\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Matt Kern\n2. Email : matt.kern&cyantechnology.com\n\nIntended usage : Limited Use\nOnly used within large utilities and their integrators.\n\nAuthor/Change controller : Matt Kern 201209140955\n\n\n(file created 2012-09-19)"
