It is used by the NUM \n   protocol (https://www.numprotocol.com, IANA scheme \"num://\") to \n   store structured data in DNS. There are around 30 million NUM \n   records written in MODL currently and the number is growing \n   consistently.\n\nAuthor/Change controller: Elliott Brown, NUM Technology Ltd"
