The information\ntransported in this media type does not include active or executable\ncontent. Mechanisms for privacy and integrity protection of protocol\nparameters exist. Those mechanisms as well as authentication and\nfurther security mechanisms are described in 3GPP TS 33.303.\n \nThis media type does not include provisions for directives that\ninstitute actions on a recipient's files or other resources.\nThis media type does not include provisions for directives that\ninstitute actions that, while not directly harmful to the recipient,\nmay result in disclosure of information that either facilitates a\nsubsequent attack or else violates a recipient's privacy in any way.\nThis media type does not employ compression.\n \nInteroperability considerations :\nThe media type allows for interoperability of messages transmitted\nover the PC3ch interface, including those related to transport of the\nusage information request of proximity services. The messages are sent\nbetween user equipment and mobile network.\n \nPublished specification :\n3GPP TS 24.334 v12.3.0 (http://www.3gpp.org/ftp/Specs/html-info/24334.htm)\n\nApplications which use this media : n/a\n\nFragment identifier considerations :\nThe handling in section 5 of IETF RFC 7303 applies.\n\nRestrictions on usage : None\n\nProvisional registration?
