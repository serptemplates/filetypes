They *are* internally documented with a file signature,\n  allowing commonground viewers to automatically handle both old and new\n  format files.  Therefore, I don't believe a 'version' parameter is needed.\n\n===========================================================================\n   Media Type name: application\nMedia Subtype name: commonground\n\n  A Content-Type of \"application/commonground\" indicates a document in\n  the Common Ground portable file format, also known as Digital Paper.\n\nRequired parameters: none\nOptional parameters: none\n\nEncoding considerations:\n  Common Ground files are in a binary format.
