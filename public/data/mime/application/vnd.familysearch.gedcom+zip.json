Similarly, as \n   with other types of archive formats, the archive might contain \n   executable code or scripts, and it falls on the software and \n   persons managing the files to guard against malicious files.\n\nInteroperability considerations: The GEDZIP version is encoded in the \n   gedcom.ged file in the archive, and an algorithm is provided for \n   detecting the version.",
