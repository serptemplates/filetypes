    "security_considerations": "- Since SARIF files are serialized as JSON, they are subject to the same \n   security vulnerabilities as any JSON file.\n\n   - The SARIF format captures results from static analysis tools. Such \n   analysis might disclose information about software vulnerabilities. \n   Therefore SARIF file contents can be extremely sensitive, requiring \n   external privacy and integrity protection. Even when the analysis results \n   themselves are not sensitive, SARIF files can have other security issues:\n\n   - SARIF files can embed the contents of the programming artifacts (such as \n   source or binary files) that were analyzed. Such content can be of any \n   type and may include compressed material, with all their associated \n   vulnerabilities.\n\n   - SARIF files can refer to programming artifacts through arbitrary URIs, \n   with all their associated vulnerabilities.\n\n   - SARIF files produced by web site analysis tools can contain the full \n   contents of the web requests sent by the tool, and the resulting web \n   responses. The contents of the requests and responses can be of any type, \n   with the associated vulnerabilities of those types.\n\n   - The use of absolute paths in analysis result location URIs might reveal \n   sensitive information about the machine on which the scan was performed.\n\n   - The use of the hostname component in analysis result location URI might \n   reveal the network location of the machine on which the scan was performed.\n\n   - The use of raw HTML in message strings expressed in Markdown might allow \n   arbitrary code execution (for example, through javascript: links).\n\n   - Any other vulnerabilities associated with Markdown can be leveraged to \n   attack a SARIF processor. For example, the use of deeply nested constructs \n   in Markdown message strings might lead to stack overflow in some Markdown \n   implementations.\n\n   - Certain properties of the SARIF object model might reveal information \n   about the machine on which a scan was run. (The specification allows such \n   properties to be omitted or \"redacted\".)\n\n   - SARIF files can contain information about how the analysis tool was \n   invoked, including the command line that was executed. This can contain \n   arbitrary commands which might damage a machine on which they are run.\n\n   - SARIF files can contain information about when the analysis tool was \n   invoked. An attacker might be able to deduce how frequently scans are run, \n   and therefore might be able to make a malicious change and then revert it \n   before the next scan detects the problem.\n\n   - SARIF files can contain information about errors encountered by the \n   analysis tool, including its exit code. This can allow an attacker to \n   craft input to attack the analysis tool.\n\n   Interoperability considerations: N/A\n\n   Published specification: Static Analysis Results Interchange Format \n   (SARIF) Version 2.1.0.
