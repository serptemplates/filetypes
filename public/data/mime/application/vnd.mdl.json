There are no pointers, no references, and no \n   direct nor dynamic memory allocation mechanisms in the language. \n   Functions have very limited read access to outside data:\n\n   -to the rendering “state” and\n   -to data passed through the function parameters.\n\n   The only means to pass data out of the function is through the \n   return value and the optional debug module.\n\n   MDL modules might reference other module files or resource files \n   (images, light profiles, bsdf measurements) locally or possibly on \n   the internet and expect them to be found and loaded.\n\n   Except for textures, there is no direct read access to resources \n   in the language. Out-of-bounds access to textures is defined to \n   always return zero.\n\n   Out-of-bounds access to arrays is defined to always return zero \n   beginning with MDL 1.8, and undefined behavior for lower versions, \n   which might pose a risk on unsuspecting integrations.\n\n   MDL does include facilities to loop, cause computationally complex \n   operations, or consume large amounts of memory.

It allows sharing physically based appearances between \n   supporting applications, for example, Adobe® Substance , Chaos \n   Software EOOD V-Ray®, NVIDIA Omniverse™ and many others. An open \n   source SDK is available to add MDL to custom applications. MDL can \n   be used with USD and an extension is under development to use MDL \n   as an alternative high quality material model within glTF.\n\nFragment identifier considerations: N/A\n\nRestrictions on usage: N/A\n\nAdditional information:\n\n   1.
