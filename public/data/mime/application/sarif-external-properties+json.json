    "security_considerations": "- Since SARIF external property files are serialized as JSON, they \n   are subject to the same security vulnerabilities as any JSON file.\n\n   - The SARIF external property file format captures results from \n   static analysis tools. Such analysis might disclose information \n   about software vulnerabilities. SARIF external property files do \n   not include any internal means to provide data confidentiality. \n   Therefore SARIF external property file contents can be extremely \n   sensitive, requiring external privacy and integrity protection. \n   Even when the analysis results themselves are not sensitive, \n   SARIF external property files can have other security issues:\n\n   - SARIF external property files can embed the contents of the \n   programming artifacts (such as source or binary files) that were \n   analyzed. Such content can be of any type and may include \n   compressed material, with all their associated vulnerabilities.\n\n   - SARIF external property files can refer to programming \n   artifacts through arbitrary URIs, with all their associated \n   vulnerabilities.\n\n   - SARIF external property files produced by web site analysis \n   tools can contain the full contents of the web requests sent by \n   the tool, and the resulting web responses. The contents of the \n   requests and responses can be of any type, with the associated \n   vulnerabilities of those types.\n\n   - The use of absolute paths in analysis result location URIs \n   might reveal sensitive information about the machine on which the \n   scan was performed.\n\n   - The use of the hostname component in analysis result location \n   URI might reveal the network location of the machine on which the \n   scan was performed.\n\n   - The use of raw HTML in message strings expressed in Markdown \n   might allow arbitrary code execution (for example, through \n   javascript: links).\n\n   - Any other vulnerabilities associated with Markdown can be \n   leveraged to attack a SARIF processor. For example, the use of \n   deeply nested constructs in Markdown message strings might lead to\n   stack overflow in some Markdown implementations.\n\n   - Certain properties of the SARIF object model might reveal \n   information about the machine on which a scan was run. (The \n   specification allows such properties to be omitted or \"redacted\".)\n\n   - SARIF external property files can contain information about how \n   the analysis tool was invoked, including the command line that was\n   executed. This can contain arbitrary commands which might damage a\n   machine on which they are run.\n\n   - SARIF external property files can contain information about when\n   the analysis tool was invoked. An attacker might be able to deduce\n   how frequently scans are run, and therefore might be able to make \n   a malicious change and then revert it before the next scan detects\n   the problem.\n\n   - SARIF external property files can contain information about \n   errors encountered by the analysis tool, including its exit code. \n   This can allow an attacker to craft input to attack the analysis \n   tool.\n\n   - SARIF external property files do not provide a way to \n   authenticate the entity that generated the content, and do not \n   provide a way to ensure that the content has not been modified. An\n   attacker could provide a specially crafted file to hide a \n   vulnerability unless an external means is used to authenticate the\n   content, such as externally-managed digital signatures.\n\nInteroperability considerations: N/A",
