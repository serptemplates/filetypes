Its content is\ngathered by journalists, presented with a journalistic style, and\nupdated according to the progression of the story.\nA News Item may convey this information in any media type or\nformat, e.g. the thumbnail, preview and high definition renditions\nof a picture. It can also convey more structured news information,\ne.g. information about companies, sports events and general\nevents, in instances when this information is related to an event or\nfact.\n\nOther Information/General Comment: none\n\nPerson to contact for further information:\nName: Michael Steidl\nE-mail: mdirector&iptc.org\n\nAuthor/Change controller:\nName: Michael Steidl\nE-mail: mdirector&iptc.org\n\n(file created 2008-07-01)"
