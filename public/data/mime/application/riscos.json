There are\r\nno (RISC OS imposed) limits on line lengths. Parts will typically be\r\nencoded as 7bit or Base64.\r\n\r\nSecurity considerations:\r\n\r\nExecutable images may be sent with this subtype - the user should\r\nexplicitly make the decision to run any executable, not the MUA.\r\n\r\nPublished specification:\r\n\r\nThis document. For further details, see the RISC OS Programmers\r\nReference Manuals, published by Acorn Computers Ltd, ISBN\r\n1-85250-110-3.\r\n\r\nParameters\r\n----------\r\n\r\nNAME=3D3D\"<filename>,<filetype>\"\r\n\r\nName parameter can give just filename, or the fully specified\r\nfilepath, with a 3 or 4 digit hex number that is the encoded filetype\r\nof the file contained. If the filetype field is missing, then choose a\r\nsensible default based on the encoding type.  \r\n\r\n  eg, NAME=3D3D\"README,fff\" \r\n  eg, NAME=3D3D\"SCSI::HardDisc.$.Mail.SpoolFile,0dc\"\r\n  \r\nTYPE=3D3D\"<filetype>\"\r\n\r\nFiletype in textual form. The remote MUA may not understand a\r\nparticular filetype (because the user does not have the relevant\r\neditor package), and so this field can clue the user as to what they\r\nneed to run the file.  This field has a maximum width of 8 bytes, and\r\nmay contain spaces.\r\n\r\n  eg, TYPE=3D3D\"Text\"\r\n  eg, TYPE\"ImpDoc\"\r\n  \r\nLOAD=3D3D<load addr>\r\n\r\nLoad address of file, as an 8-digit hex number (32-bit word). In the\r\ncase of a filetyped file, this contains the filetype, and part of the\r\ncoded 5-byte time-date stamp for the file (see PRMs for more details).\r\n\r\n  eg, LOAD=3D3D&FFF01234\r\n\r\nEXEC=3D3D<exec addr>\r\n\r\nExecution address of file, as an 8-digit hex number (32-bit word).  In\r\nthe case of a filetyped file, this contains part of the encoded 5-byte\r\ntime- date stamp for the file (see PRMs for more details).\r\n\r\n  eg, EXEC=3D3D&0035FD23\r\n  \r\nACCESS=3D3D<access byte>\r\n\r\nThis is the encoded file access bits as a 2-digit hex number (8-bit\r\nbyte).  Currently only certain bit fields are defined to map to access\r\npermissions.  See PRMs for details of currently defined bit fields.\r\n\r\n  eg, ACCESS=3D3D&02\r\n      \r\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\r\n\r\nN.A.Smith, ANT Limited,PO Box 300,Cambridge,CB1 2EG, UK.\r\n<nas&ant.co.uk>\r\n\r\nN.B.Van Someren, 24 Hooper Street,Cambridge,CB1 2NZ, UK.\r\n<nicko&ant.co.uk>\r\n\r\n[]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
