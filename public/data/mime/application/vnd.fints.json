    "template_text": "(last updated 2003-05-13)\r\n\r\nMIME media type name : Application\r\n\r\nMIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.fints\r\n\r\nRequired parameters : version: Version of the \r\nFinTS specification. The value must be formed upon the pattern x.yz where \r\nx, y ans z are digits and z is omitted if it is 0; at the moment valid \r\nversion-parameters are: 2.01, 2.1, 2.2, 3.0 and 4.0\r\n\r\nOptional parameters : none\r\n\r\nEncoding considerations : 8bit\r\nThis media type may require encoding on transports not capable of handling \r\n8 bit text.\r\n\r\nSecurity considerations : \r\nFinTS has its own security framework providing several possibilities to \r\nprotect the exchanged messages:\r\n(a) XML Signature and XML Encryption with RSA- and DES-algorithms. Signatures \r\n    are used for secure identifiaction of customers and banks. This subset of the \r\n    security framework is called HBCI security (Home Banking Computer Interface).\r\n(b) PIN and one time password authentication (PIN/TAN)\r\n(c) bilateral concerted security techniques ('user-defined signature')\r\nThis MIME-type is used for the exchange of financial messages. There is no \r\nexecutable content in FinTS messages. (see FinTS specification)\r\n\r\nInteroperability considerations : \r\nConformance of FinTS MIME to the FinTS specification is required.\r\n\r\nPublished specification : \r\nThe specification of FinTS in German and English language can be downloaded \r\nfrom http://www.fints.org/spezifikation/2.html\r\n\r\nApplications which use this media : \r\nGerman Banks support FinTS as an open standard. There are several FinTS server \r\nproducts, at least two different client APIs and a lot of client products. Additional \r\ninformation can be found at http://www.siz.de and http://www.bdb.de\r\n\r\nAdditional information :\r\n\r\n1. Magic number(s) : none\r\n2. File extension(s) : .hbci and .hbc; .kom, .upa, .pkd an .bpd for special purpose\r\n3. Macintosh file type code : none\r\n4. Object Identifiers: none\r\n\r\nThe media type application/vnd.fints is containing sequences of segments specified \r\nin the specification for Financial Transaction Services (FinTS). FinTS is successor \r\nof HBCI (Home Banking Computer Interface) which defined a EDIFACT-based message \r\nformat (the MIME type for HBCI is application/vnd.hbci). Beginning with version \r\n3.0 the name FinTS is used. With version 4.0 the syntax of the exchanged messages \r\nis changed to an XML-based format. Further information can be found at \r\nhttp://www.fints.org/\r\n\r\nPerson to contact for further information :\r\n\r\n1. Name : Ingo Hammann\r\n2. Email : ingo.hammann&ppi.de\r\n\r\nIntended usage : Common \r\nFinTS is intended for banking applications but may also be used to exchange any \r\nkind of information as long as the messages abide by the guidelines of the FinTS \r\nspecification.\r\n\r\nAuthor/Change controller : Zentraler Kreditausschuss (http://www.zka.de) is\r\nthe standardization board for the FinTS standard.\r\nPlease contact me under the above address if you need further information.     \r\n\r\n(file created 2003-05-13)"
