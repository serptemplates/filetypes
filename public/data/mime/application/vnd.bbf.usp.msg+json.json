It may also provide access to read private information. USP Message requires encryption using TLS or DTLS above the transport protocol and requires all endpoints to have X.509 certificates for authentication and authorization. As different implementations will provide access to different capabilities or information (i.e., not all will allow firmware updates, reboots, configuration, or access to private information), the actual trust model to be used by an endpoint will be defined by the endpoint manufacturer and/or controlling entity. Additional security requirements and discussion are documented in the published specification.
