Deprecated alias names for this type: N/A\n2. Magic number(s): N/A\n3. File extension(s): N/A\n4. Macintosh file type code: N/A\n5. Object Identifiers: N/A\n\nGeneral Comments: This media type identifies a meta-format that encompasses all JSON sequence-based formats that encode a sequence of JSON objects whose members have specific names and types. It is intended for use in applications that describe files using media types, but do not have sufficient heuristics to output a more specific media type. In such a case, the application may parse the JSON sequence and analyze the existing top-level members to populate the parameters.\n\nThere are a few details to be noted:\n* The set of allowed parameter names is more restricted compared to what is permitted by the general syntax in [RFC 2045], Section 5.1. While JSON member names may contain any Unicode characters, arbitrary Unicode strings seldom denote any useful structure in JSON documents, and thus this set is limited further to cover only names that can be commonly used as identifiers in programming languages (specifically, it is aligned with the NCName production in XML). This also causes common metadata member names, such as those beginning on \"$\" in JSON Schema or \"@\" in JSON-LD, to be excluded.\n* There is no rule that individual JSON objects in a sequence must correspond to the same schema, thus, when a particular sequence of JSON objects is encountered, it must be parsed fully to ascertain that individual objects are compatible. When any two top-level members with equivalent names (regardless of casing differences, since media type parameter names are case-insensitive) are encountered, they MUST be ignored if they have different types when populating the media type parameters, and when validating JSON objects against this media type, any member whose name case-insensitively matches the parameter is sufficient to validate that parameter if the types correspond. In addition, the relevant members MUST be present in every individual object in the sequence. This process may lead to an application/prs.implied-object+json-seq object with no parameters, which is valid and denotes any sequence of JSON objects (empty or non-empty).\n* Media type parameters are generally unordered, and while this aligns with common JSON implementations, some situations may require a particular order of members or consider objects differing in the member order alone to be different. When validating the members, no particular order should be required, and when populating the parameters, it is recommended to sort them alphabetically in a case-insensitive manner (i.e. converted to uppercase and sorted lexicographically according to the ASCII values of individual characters) to simplify comparisons or indexing.\n* The member types are determined in accordance with the JSON grammar, indicated by `value` in Section 3, [RFC 8259]. The types \"object\", \"array\", \"number\", and \"string\" correspond to the grammar rules directly, while \"boolean\" is determined by the literal values \"true\" and \"false\". As an exception, \"null\" is removed from this set and null-valued members are impossible to express, with the assumption that any such member may have valid values other than \"null\" which would otherwise lead to completely incompatible media types. Null-valued members are however taken into account for the repeated members case described above, and cause other-valued members with an equivalent name to be ignored.\n\nExamples:\n\napplication/prs.implied-object+json-seq;bbox=array;geometry=object;type=string - The media type that may represent any sequence of JSON objects with these properties, such as an application/geo+json-seq sequence of Feature objects with a bounding box.\n\napplication/prs.implied-object+json-seq;type=string - Likewise, but only with the required members, such as an application/geo+json-seq sequence with arbitrary objects, but also all other sequences sharing this member.\n\nPerson to contact for further information:\n\n1. Name: Marek Čermák\n2. Email: cermmarek&gmail.com\n\nIntended usage: LIMITED USE\n\nIt is not recommended to use this media type when a more concrete type is known. Its use beyond automated archival, content negotiation and other purposes in general file hosting is limited. Applications should not advocate themselves as accepting this media type if they require more specific structure or format.\n\nAuthor/Change controller: Marek Čermák <cermmarek&gmail.com>"
