The first is a binary format, the second is\ntext-based.  In addition there are many versions of each of these\nformats, corresponding to different versions of the product.  The file\nformats and versions can be distinguished by an internal file\nsignature which allows FrameMaker to automatically handle both forms\nand old versions of the files. Both formats are intended to be\nportable to different platforms and operating systems.  Adobe Systems,\nInc. owns these formats.\n\nThis application is for the FrameMaker Interchange Format (mif)\n\nMedia Type: application\n\nMedia subtype name: vnd.mif\n\nRequired parameters: none\n\nOptional parameters: none\n\nEncoding considerations:\n        MIF files are encoded in US-ASCII.\n\nSecurity considerations:\n         None known\n\nPublished specification:\n\n        The MIF reference manual is available in the online help for\n        FrameMaker.\n        It can also be downloaded from\n        ftp://ftp.frame.com/pub/techsup/techinfo/dos/mif4.zip\n        ftp://ftp.frame.com/pub/techsup/techinfo/mac/mif4mac.hqx\n\t\t\nPerson & email address to contact for further information\n\n        Mike Wexler\n        Adobe Systems, Inc\n        333 W.
