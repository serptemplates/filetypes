    "security_considerations": "The underlying LAS format, and thus LASzip, utilize a structure that can store arrays of point cloud data and metadata corresponding to this point cloud data. The fields defined in the LAS format are of a descriptive nature and provide information that may be useful to facilitate viewing, rendering, and cataloging of data by a recipient. As such, the fields currently defined in the LAS format do not in and of themselves create additional security risks, since the fields are not used to induce any behavior by the recipient application.\n\nHowever, LAS has an extensible structure, supporting both extensions defined and standardized by ASPRS and vendor-defined extensions, thus presenting additional security risks. It is thus possible that data embedded in a LAS or LASzip file could be used to induce actions on the part of the recipient, either through a well-defined and known software capability, or as a result of malware or other malicious exploitation.\n\nIt should be noted that many LAS data producers will include additional extensions that specify metadata fields specifying confidentiality markings, access rights and handling of the data, including requirements if the file is to be maintained in a secure environment. In this case the intention is that alteration or removal of this metadata from the file would be treated as an offense under national or international law, as would be removing the file from a secure environment. While LASzip does not include the ability within itself to encrypt the contents, end-to-end encryption (e.g., HTTPS, TLS, SSL) should be used when transmitting files that include sensitive data or where access is restricted. Once received, these sensitive files should also be encrypted at rest using storage-based encryption mechanisms.\n\nLASzip provides significant compression of the underlying data, and thus the data in useable form could represent many times the data volume, and thus consume significantly more resources than might be assumed based on size of the original LASzip file.",
    "interoperability_considerations": "The LGPL-licensed LASzip library is easily integrated via the DLL that is in the LASzip subdirectory of the LAStools distribtion. Other options are to link LASzip via the BSD-licensed libLAS library or to work with the LASlib library which fully integrates and enhances the LASzip codebase with spatial indexing, filters, transforms and geo-referencing of LAS and LAZ files.",

The data will generally be put into this format from software (e.g. provided by LIDAR hardware vendors) which combines GPS, IMU, and laser pulse range data to produce X, Y, and Z point data.
