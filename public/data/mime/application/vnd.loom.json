The library is actively \n   maintained and vulnerabilities are being addressed, but protection\n   against attack requires users to stay up to date with patches.\n\n   An updated list of HDF5 library vulnerabilities can be found here:\n\nhttps://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-15991/product_id-35054/Hdfgroup-Hdf5.html\n\n   Furthermore, Loom files do not provide any internal features to \n   ensure content privacy or integrity. For example, datasets are not\n   cryptographically signed. Any such services, if needed, must be \n   supplied externally.\n\n   HDF5, and thus Loom, supports compression. This poses a security \n   risk in the form of a decompression bomb, or zip bomb. For \n   example, a dataset that looks small on disk can inflate to a very \n   large size when loaded in memory. No protection against zip bombs \n   is provided by Loom.\n\n   Given these issues, Loom files should only be accepted from \n   trusted sources.\n\nInteroperability considerations: Loom files are designed to be \n   interoperable across file systems, operating systems and computer \n   architecture (e.g. endianness).
