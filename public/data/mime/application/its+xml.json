    "template_text": "(Registered 2013-08-20, last updated 2013-08-20)\n\nName : Philippe Le Hegaret\n\nEmail : plh&w3.org\n\nMIME media type name : Application\n\nMIME subtype name : Standards Tree - its+xml\n\nRequired parameters : none\n\nOptional parameters :\ncharset\nThis parameter has identical semantics to the charset parameter of the \n\"application/xml\" media type as specified in IETF RFC 3023.\n\n\nEncoding considerations :\nBy virtue of ITS 2.0 elements being XML, the same considerations when\nsent as \"application/its+xml\" as does XML. See RFC 3023, section 3.2.\n\n\nSecurity considerations :\nAny XML document containing ITS 1.0 \"its:rules\" elements\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/its/#selection-global can be labeled with\napplication/its+xml. An ITS 1.0 or ITS 2.0 document may cause arbitrary\nURIs or IRIs to be dereferenced, via the @xlink:href attribute at the\nits:rules element. Therefore, the security issues of [RFC3986] Section 7\nshould be considered. In addition, the contents of resources identified\nby file: URIs can in some cases be accessed, processed and returned as\nresults. An implementation of ITS global rules requires the support of\nXPath 1.0 or its successor. Hence, processing of global rules might\nencompass dereferencing of URIs or IRIs during computation of XPath\nexpressions. Arbitrary recursion is possible, as is arbitrarily large\nmemory usage, and implementations may place limits on CPU and memory\nusage, as well as restricting access to system-defined functions. ITS\n1.0 and ITS 2.0 permit extensions. Hence it is possible that\napplication/its+xml may describe content that has security implications\nbeyond those described here. Because of these considerations\napplication/its+xml may require integrity protection, either through the\nuse of signing or transport protection mechanisms.\n\n\nInteroperability considerations :\n\n\nPublished specification :\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/2007/REC-its-20070403/ and http://www.w3.org/TR/its20/\n\nAny XML document containing ITS 1.0 \"its:rules\" elements \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/its/#selection-global can be labeled with application/its+xml. \nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/its/EX-link-external-rules-2.xml provides an example of a \ndocument linking to a file with ITS 1.0 and ITS 2.0 \"rules\". The link target is \nat http://www.w3.org/TR/its/EX-link-external-rules-1.xml. There is no need that \nthe link target has \"its:rules\" as a root element. The processing semantics is \nthat rules are gathered in document order.\n\n\nApplications which use this media :\nThis new media type is being registered to allow for deployment of ITS 1.0 and \nITS 2.0 on the World Wide Web., e.g. by localization tools.\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : none\n2. File extension(s) : .its\n3. Macintosh file type code : TEXT\n4. Object Identifiers: none\n\nnone\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Internationalization Tag Set Interest Group\n2. Email : public-i18n-its-ig&w3.org\n\nIntended usage : Common\nnone\n\nAuthor/Change controller : The Internationalization Tag Set (ITS) 1.0 and 2.0 \nspecifications are a work product of the World Wide Web Consortium's \nInternationalization Tag Set Working Group. The W3C has change control over this \nspecification."
