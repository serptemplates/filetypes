Speed runs are either\nunassisted where a player plays the game in realtime as close as\npossible to normal gameplay situations or tool assisted where a player\nuses various forms of tools, such as slow down emulation, rerecording\nand memory watching, to produce an optimal movie without concerns for\nnormal gameplay situations. This format can be used for both types.\n\nRequired parameters:\nNone\n\nOptional parameters:\nNone\n\nEncoding considerations:\nBinary\n\nSecurity considerations:\n\nMovies are recorded input to a computer program. As such they should not\nbe run on privileged programs.
