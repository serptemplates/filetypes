    "template_text": "(RFC 2045 and 2046 published November 1996, subtype last updated April November 1996)\n\nThe \"octet-stream\" subtype is used to indicate that a body contains\narbitrary binary data.  The set of currently defined parameters is:\n\n (1)   TYPE -- the general type or category of binary data.\n       This is intended as information for the human recipient\n       rather than for any automatic processing.\n\n (2)   PADDING -- the number of bits of padding that were\n       appended to the bit-stream comprising the actual\n       contents to produce the enclosed 8bit byte-oriented\n       data.  This is useful for enclosing a bit-stream in a\n       body when the total number of bits is not a multiple of\n       8.\n\nBoth of these parameters are optional.\n\nAn additional parameter, \"CONVERSIONS\", was defined in RFC 1341 but\nhas since been removed.  RFC 1341 also defined the use of a \"NAME\"\nparameter which gave a suggested file name to be used if the data\nwere to be written to a file.  This has been deprecated in\nanticipation of a separate Content-Disposition header field, to be\ndefined in a subsequent RFC.\n\nThe recommended action for an implementation that receives an\n\"application/octet-stream\" entity is to simply offer to put the data\nin a file, with any Content-Transfer-Encoding undone, or perhaps to\nuse it as input to a user-specified process.\n\nTo reduce the danger of transmitting rogue programs, it is strongly\nrecommended that implementations NOT implement a path-search\nmechanism whereby an arbitrary program named in the Content-Type\nparameter (e.g., an \"interpreter=\" parameter) is found and executed\nusing the message body as input."
