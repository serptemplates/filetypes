Exporting RMS files may compromise the \ndata. An RMS file from an untrusted source is potentially unsafe and may break \nthe integrity of an application. It may be possible to exploit application \nvulnerability using malicious RMS file.\n\n\nInteroperability considerations :\nNone\n\nPublished specification :\nEarly draft of specification is available at\nhttp://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=271\n\nApplications which use this media :\nRMS file contains persistent data for the MIDP application.\nMIDP applications and application management software use this format for the \ndata provisioning, exchange and backup.\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : First six bytes: 0x4d 0x49 0x44 0x52 0x4d 0x53 (&#8220;MIDRMS&#8221;)\n2. File extension(s) : rms\n3. Macintosh file type code : None\n4. Object Identifiers: None\n\n\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Mikhail Gorshenev\n2. Email : Mikhail.Gorshenev&sun.com\n\nIntended usage : Common\n\n\nAuthor/Change controller : The Java Community Process(JCP) oversees the \nchanges made by theJSR-271 expert group to the MIDP Specification.\n(See Java Community Process website for details http://java.sun.com/jcp)\n\n(file created 2007-06-25)"
