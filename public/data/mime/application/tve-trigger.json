The media \r\ntype is used to instantiate a trigger receiver object on a TV \r\nenhancement HTML page. The trigger receiver object is executable \r\ncode implemented by a TV receiver.\r\n\r\nSample instantiation:\r\n\r\n<OBJECT TYPE=\"application/tve-trigger\" ID=\"triggerReceiverObj\"> \r\n</OBJECT> \r\n\r\nThe OBJECT tag must be void of content. The TYPE and ID \r\nattributes must be set as shown in the example. \r\n\r\nThe trigger receiver object processes messages, called triggers, \r\ntransmitted in a TV signal for the associated TV enhancement. \r\n\r\nTriggers are text based, and their syntax follows the basic \r\nformat of the [EIA-746A] standard (7-bit ASCII, the high-order \r\nbit of the first byte must be \"0\").\r\n\r\nSee [SMPTE-DDE1] for more information on trigger contents and the \r\ntrigger receiver object.\r\n\r\n\r\n   Security considerations: \r\n\r\nAll insertion points for content in the TV network are assumed to \r\nbe trusted sources, so no security problems are presumed. \r\nTherefore, the use of scripts in triggers, and ECMA Script in \r\ngeneral is not presumed to be a security problem for malicious \r\ncontent or viruses any more than the notion of rogue video and \r\naudio being inserted into a broadcaster's emission.  As with \r\nvideo and audio, the broadcaster is responsible for the quality \r\nof the data content of its programming.\r\n\r\n   Interoperability considerations: none\r\n\r\n   Published specification:\r\n\r\n[SMPTE-DDE1]: \"SMPTE 363M, Declarative Data Essence, Content Level 1\", \r\nproduced by the Society of Motion Picture and Television \r\nEngineers (http://www.smpte.org), describes the trigger format, \r\nand the behavior of the trigger receiver object. All SMPTE \r\nstandards can be purchased for a nominal fee at \r\nhttp://www.smpte.org/stds/index.html. Note: SMPTE specification \r\nnumber will be assigned once registration of this media type is \r\napproved by the IANA.\r\n\r\n[EIA-746A]: \"Transport Of Internet Uniform Resource Locator (URL) \r\nInformation Using TEXT-2 (T-2) Service\", produced by Consumer \r\nElectronics Manufacturers Association (CEMA), and can be \r\npurchased from Global Engineering Documents \r\n(http://global.ihs.com/).\r\n\r\n   Applications which use this media type:\r\n\r\nEnhanced television receivers, which conform to [SMPTE-DDE1].\r\n\r\n   Additional information:\r\n\r\n       Magic number(s): none\r\n       File extension(s): n/a\r\n       Macintosh File Type Code(s): n/a\r\n\r\n   Person & email address to contact for further information:\r\n\r\nLinda Bucsay Welsh \r\nIntel Corporation\r\n2111 NE 25th Ave.\r\nHillsboro, OR 97124-5961\r\n\r\nTelephone:\t503 264 4987\r\nFAX:\t\t503 264 3375\r\nInternet:\tlinda&intel.com\r\n\r\n   Intended usage: COMMON\r\n\r\n   Author/Change controller: SMPTE (http://www.smpte.org) \r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n"
