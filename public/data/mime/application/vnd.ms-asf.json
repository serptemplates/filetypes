Some \n     encoding will be necessary for MIME mailers as in \n     application/octet-stream (see RFC 2046).\n\n     Interoperability considerations: Clients must ignore any received \n     ASF content which they do not understand or which they do not know\n     how to render.\n\n     Security considerations: ASF content has a security risk equal to \n     that of the media types it carries.\n\n     Published specification: \n     http://www.microsoft.com/NetShow/asf-wp.htm\n\n     Applications which use this media type: Streaming Multimedia \n     applications in (1) Real Time (e.g., Conferencing applications), \n     (2) \"On Demand\" (e.g., streaming multimedia content \n     for web pages), and (3) store and forward (e.g., Email). \n\n     Additional information:\n\n     File extension(s): .asf\n\n     Person & email address to contact for further information:\n     Eric Fleischman\n     Microsoft Corporation\n     One Microsoft Way\n     Redmond, WA 98052-6399\n     Email: ericf&microsoft.com\n     Phone: 206-957-5334\n     Fax:   206-936-7329\n\n     Intended usage: Network-oriented streamed multimedia information \n     sent via either Unicast and Multicast modes.\n\n     (One of COMMON, LIMITED USE or OBSOLETE)Common\n\n     (Any other information that the author deems interesting may be\n     added below this line.)\n     ASF is a multimedia file format whose contents are designed to be \n     streamed across a network to support distributed multimedia \n     applications.  ASF content may include any combination of any \n     media type (e.g., audio, video, images, URLs, HTML content, MIDI, \n     2D & 3D modeling, scripts, and objects of various types).  \n\n\n\n\n"
