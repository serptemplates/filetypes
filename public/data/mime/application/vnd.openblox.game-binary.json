    "template_text": "(registered 2015-08-28, last updated 2015-08-28)\n\nName : Mark Otaris\n\nEmail : mark.otaris&openmailbox.org\n\nMIME media type name : Application\n\nMIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.openblox.game-binary\n\nRequired parameters : N/A\n\nOptional parameters : \nN/A\n\nEncoding considerations : binary\n\n\nSecurity considerations : \nFiles using this media time can contain active content that will be\nexecuted when they are used. The specific capabilities of this\nexecutable code depend on the context and on the application used, but\nthere is no system in place intended to prevent execution of untrusted\ncode.\n\nIn order to preserve the user from harm, applications using this media\ntype must make sure that the active content in untrusted files is not\ncapable of arbitrarily manipulating the system it executes on and that\nthey do not disclose information that may make a subsequent attack\neasier or violate the user's privacy.\n\nSince this active content will usually be used on a system with a\nfilesystem, this will generally mean making sure there is no way for\nthe active content to get access to parts of the filesystem that do not\ncontain resources necessary for the use of this active content, usually\nfiles in a resources folder. The media type does not provide this\nprotection, since the interface used to access the host system is not\ndependent on the way the game objects are encoded, or on the interface\nused to manipulate them.\n\nFiles using this media type do not need to be transmitted over a\nnetwork by implementations of the media type, since communication\nbetween game clients and game servers is done using streams containing\nbinary data that is not necessarily equivalent to this format. For this\nreason, the applications using this media type do not need to care for\nthe integrity of the files. However, when these files are transmitted\nover a network for storage, backup or other purposes using other means,\ncare should be taken to use secure transport protocols in order to\nguarantee the integrity of the files.\n\nInteroperability considerations : \nThis media type corresponds to the networking protocol used by the OpenBlox game engine to transport game data over a network connection. The implementation used may be difficult to replicate using other libraries or frameworks. For this reason, it is expected that applications will use the XML media type instead. A specification for this media type will be published when time allows.\n\nPublished specification : \nThere is no published specification for this media type at the moment.\n\nApplications which use this media : \nThis media type is used by OpenBlox Studio and the OpenBlox game engine.\n\nFragment identifier considerations :\nN/A\n\nRestrictions on usage :\nNo restrictions on usage of this media type arise from patented technology or intellectual property rights.\n\nProvisional registration? (standards tree only) :\nN/A\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Deprecated alias names for this type : N/A\n2. Magic number(s) : N/A\n3. File extension(s) : obg\n4. Macintosh file type code : N/A\n5. Object Identifiers: N/A\n\nThe OpenBlox game engine is capable of converting from this media type to the corresponding XML media type and from the XML media type to this media type. This may be of particular importance for interoperability.\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Mark Otaris\n2. Email : mark.otaris&openmailbox.org\n\nIntended usage : Common\nThis media type is intended for usage with the OpenBlox game engine and applications that use or modify files for this game engine.\n\nAuthor/Change controller : Mark Otaris <mark.otaris&openmailbox.org>\nJohn M Harris, Jr. <jharris&johnmh.me>"
