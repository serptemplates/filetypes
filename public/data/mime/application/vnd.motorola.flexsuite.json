This type would be used by the network gateways of\nwireless messaging service providers as well as operating systems and\napplications of wireless devices.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : \n2. File extension(s) : \n3. Macintosh file type code : \nBecause FLEXsuite(tm) is a collection of protocols, the structure of\nthe content for this media type provides for determining the specific\nprotocol represented in the data payload. The individual protocols may\nalso be transferred using media types associated with their content\nstructure.\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Mark Patton\n2. E-mail : fmp014&email.mot.com\n\nIntended usage : Common \nFacilitate advanced application solutions in the wireless messaging\nindustry.\n\nAuthor/Change controller : The FLEXsuite(tm) of Enabling Protocols is\nmanaged by the FLEXsuite(tm) Protocol Development staff of Motorola's\nPersonal Networks Group.\n\n\n"
