Therefore, it provides\r\nvery limited interoperability with applications that understand XML.\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished specification : \r\nAs stated previously, this MIME type uses XML to store its structure and\r\nmetadata. However, the details of this structure are proprietary to\r\nCritical Tools, Inc.\r\n\r\nApplications which use this media : \r\nPERT Chart EXPERT published by Critical Tools, Inc.
