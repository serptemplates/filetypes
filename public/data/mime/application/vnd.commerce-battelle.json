Applebaum\n\nE-mail : applebau&131.167.52.15\n\nMIME media type name : Application,        vnd.commerce-battelle\n\nMIME subtype name : Vendor Tree\n\nRequired parameters : None\n\nOptional parameters : CHARSET, as defined for MIME.\n\nEncoding considerations : May need QUOTED-PRINTABLE transfer encoding.\n\nSecurity considerations : Smart Card Commerce transactions typically include \nsensitive data, so that transmission often needs to attend to authentication, \ndata integrity, privacy, access control and non- repudiation concerns.  This \nspecification permits transmission of such smart card based data via services \nwhich support MIME object encapsulation.  This specification does NOT, itself, \nprovide security related mechanisms.  These mechanisms must be added either by \nproprietary means or MIME based security services such as: Security Multipart \nfor MIME - RFC1847, Secure MIME- RSA PKCS(Public Key Cryptography Standards), \nMIME Object Security Services - RFC1848, Message security Protocol - Draft RFC \nby Housley.\n\n\nInteroperability considerations : \n\nPublished specification : \n\nApplications which use this media : Existing practice for exchanging Smart Card \nBased information includes a wide range of specifications. This traffic is \nexpected to grow substantially.\n\nThis content type provides a means of delimiting such content in a standard \nfashion.\n\nUsage:  This is a generic mechanism for sending Smart Card based information for\ndigital commerce, identification, authentication, exchange of smart card based \ncard holder information.\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) :  \n2. File extension(s) : ica,icf,icd,icc,ic# where # is an integer such that  \n-1<#<9.\n3. Macintosh file type code : \n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : David C. Applebaum\n2. E-mail : applebau&131.167.52.15\n\nIntended usage : COMMON.  Usage:  This is a generic mechanism for sending Smart \nCard based information.\n\n\n\nAuthor/Change controller : David C.
