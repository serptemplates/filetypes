It allows sharing physically based appearances between \n   supporting applications, for example, Adobe® Substance , Chaos \n   Software EOOD V-Ray®, NVIDIA Omniverse™ and many others. An open \n   source SDK is available to add MDL to custom applications. MDL can \n   be used with USD and an extension is under development to use MDL \n   as an alternative high quality material model within glTF.\n\nFragment identifier considerations: N/A\n\nRestrictions on usage: N/A\n\nAdditional information:\n\n   1.
