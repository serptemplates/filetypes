    "template_text": "(last updated 2012-03-27)\n\nMIME media type name : Application\n\nMIME subtype name : Vendor Tree - vnd.dm.delegation+xml\n\nRequired parameters : None\n\nOptional parameters : None\n\nEncoding considerations : 8bit\n\nSecurity considerations : In order for device management servers to \n   exchange delegation protocol messages, the device management \n   servers use an xml document containing delegation protocol \n   parameters after having set up a secure connection. This \n   delegation message does not contain any confidential information\n   and if the device management servers are not familiar with each \n   other, there would not be a secure connection established in the \n   first place. It is a pre-requisite that the device management (DM) \n   servers will trust each other as contractual negotiation will have \n   been done between the management authorities before any delegation \n   process can be started. The creation of a secure connection \n   between the device management servers is mandatory and requires \n   pro-active certificates exchange. There is no executable content \n   exchanged between the device management servers. The XML document \n   does not contain confidential information.\n\n   Here is the list of the main data:\n\n   - DM Server Identifier\n   - Device Identifier\n   - Device Manufacturer\n   - Device Model\n   - The part of DM Tree which management is to be delegated\n   - Type of delegation\n   - Session Identifier\n\nInteroperability considerations :\n\nPublished specification : OMA Device Management Server Delegation \n   Protocol, a subset of the OMA Device Management Protocol (v1.3), \n   http://www.openmobilealliance.org/\n\nApplications which use this media : This MIME content type is \n   intended for common use by networked data device management \n   applications.\n\nAdditional information :\n\n   1. Magic number(s) : None\n   2. File extension(s) : None\n   3. Macintosh file type code : None\n   4. Object Identifiers: None\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n   1. Name : Axel Ferrazzini\n   2. Email : aferrazzini&rim.com\n\nIntended usage : Common\n\nAuthor/Change controller : OMA Device Management working group\n\n(file created 2012-03-27)"
