    "template_text": "(file created 2013-05-01, last updated 2013-05-01)\n\nMIME media type name : Application\n\nMIME subtype name : Standards Tree - urc-targetdesc+xml\n\nRequired parameters : none\n\nOptional parameters : charset parameter (see definition of charset\nparameter for application/xml, RFC 3023). The allowed values are:\n\"utf-8\" [RFC2279] and \"utf-16\" [RFC2781]. In the absence of the\ncharset parameter, UTF-8 and UTF-16 are differentiated by the\nprocedure described in [XML 4.3.3].\n\n[XML 4.3.3] Extensible Markup Language (XML) 1.0 (Fifth Edition). W3C\nRecommendation 26 November 2008. 4.3.3 Character Encoding in Entities.\nhttp://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#charencoding\n\nEncoding considerations : binary\n\n\nSecurity considerations : The general utility of this media type to\nthe Internet community is in the area of remote user interfaces for\ndevices and services that use Internet-based technologies, in\nparticular the Universal Remote Console (URC) technology (ISO/IEC\n24752). A Target Description document contains discovery information\non a URC-compatible device/service, and links to related documents\nsuch as Socket Descriptions and Resource Sheets.\n\nThe basic (standardized) format of information contained in the media\ntype does not carry active or executable content. However, the\n<extension> and <mapping> elements (see ISO/IEC 24752-4:2013, sections\n6.8.5, 6.13.11, and 6.14) that allow for vendor- and platform-specific\nextensions, could potentially carry such content. ISO/IEC 24752-4:2013\ncontains a note that strongly discourages vendors to use the\n<extension> element for active or executable content.\n\nThe information contained in the media type exposes discovery\ninformation on target devices and applications that are - in most\ncases - not sensitive to privacy and integrity. However, for sensitive\ntargets transport security (HTTPS) may be employed, providing a basic\nlevel of integrity and privacy. This would prevent e.g. a spoofing\nattack, in which a client may get directed to a wrong target, and thus\nexpose their login information to a third party.\n\nNote: ISO/IEC 24752-4:2013 section 6.15 explicitly encourages vendors\nand platform carriers to consider employment of privacy and integrity\nservices such as transport security. However, concrete measures in\nthis regard are outside the scope of this standard.\n\nSee also the security considerations described in section 10 of RFC\n3023.\n\nInteroperability considerations :\n\n\nPublished specification : ISO/IEC 24752-4:2013 (currently in FDIS\nvote)\n\nApplications which use this media : Universal Remote Console clients,\ni.e. software and hardware for the purpose of remote control of\ndevices and services.\n\n\nAdditional information :\n\n1. Magic number(s) : Same as magic number(s) of text/xml as specified\nin RFC 3023 2. File extension(s) : .td 3. Macintosh file type code :\nnot assigned 4. Object Identifiers: not assigned\n\nThis is a resubmission of ticket 645804 which was closed as a matter\nof administrative procedure.\n\nPerson to contact for further information :\n\n1. Name : Gottfried Zimmermann 2. Email : gzimmermann&acm.org\n\nIntended usage : Common\n\n\nAuthor/Change controller : ISO/IEC 24752-4 is an international\nstandard by ISO/IEC JTC1 SC35, with editor Gottfried Zimmermann.\nISO/IEC JTC1 SC35 has change control over ISO/IEC 24752-4."
