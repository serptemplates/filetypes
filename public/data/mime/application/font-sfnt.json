However, this very extensibility may present \nspecific security concerns – the flexibility and ease of adding new data \nstructures makes it easy for any arbitrary data to be hidden inside a \nfont file.

Even though \nhints operate within the confines of the glyph outline conversion system \nand have no access outside the font rendering engine, hint instructions \ncan be, however, quite complex, and a maliciously designed complex font \ncould cause undue resource consumption (e.g. memory or CPU cycles) on a \nmachine interpreting it. Indeed, fonts are sufficiently complex, and \nmost (if not all) interpreters cannot be completely protected from \nmalicious fonts without undue performance penalties.\n\nWidespread use of fonts as necessary component of visual content \npresentation warrants that a careful attention should be given to \nsecurity considerations whenever a font is either embedded into an \nelectronic document or transmitted alongside media content.",
    "interoperability_considerations": "As it was noted in the first paragraph of the \"Security considerations\" \nsection, the same font format wrapper can be used to encode fonts with \ndifferent types of glyph data represented as either TrueType or \nPostScript (CFF) outlines. Existing font rendering engines may not be \nable to process some of the particular outline formats, and downloading \na font resource that contains unsupported glyph data format would result \nin inability of application to render and display text. Therefore, it \nwould be extremely useful to clearly identify the format of the glyph \noutline data within a font using an optional parameter, and allow \napplications to make decisions about downloading a particular font \nresource sooner. Similar, another optional parameter is suggested to \nidentify the type of text shaping and layout mechanism that is supported \nby a font.

Various font \noutline formats can be utilized as part of the font data set, e.g. a \nfont compliant with the ISO/IEC 14496-22 standard may contain either \nTrueType or CFF (Adobe PostScript Compact Font Format) outlines. \nSimilarly, fonts may implement support for various text layout \nmechanisms such as OpenType layout, Apple Advanced Typography or \nGraphite (developed by SIL International). The following optional \nparameters can be used to specify a set of features a particular font \nresource would support:\n\n1) Name: Outlines\nValue: TTF, CFF\nThis parameter can be used to specify the type of outlines supported by \nthe font.
