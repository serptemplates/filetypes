We don't allow scripts in it, we don't embed binaries in it. Our application does not have any \"eval\" on the document or parts of it. The security issues associates with this type have not been assessed by a 3rd party.\r\n\r\nInteroperability considerations :\r\n\r\n\r\nPublished specification :\r\nThe closest thing we have to a spec is http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/111834\r\n\r\nApplications which use this media :\r\nBalsamiq Mockups, myBalsamiq and other applications listed on http://support.balsamiq.com/customer/portal/articles/135659\r\n\r\nAdditional information :\r\n\r\n1. Magic number(s) : none\r\n2. File extension(s) : bmml\r\n3. Macintosh file type code : BMML\r\n4. Object Identifiers: none\r\n\r\nI'm a well meaning and well respected software vendor (balsamiq.com) trying to do the right thing by registering our xml-based file type with IANA. If I left some answers blank it's not because I didn't read the RFCs, it's because I wasn't sure they were needed. Please let me know if you have any questions.\r\n\r\nPerson to contact for further information :\r\n\r\n1. Name : Giacomo Guilizzoni\r\n2.
