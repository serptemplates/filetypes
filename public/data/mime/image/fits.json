Files with 4 or more\nnon-degenerate axes (NAXISn>1) SHOULD be described as\n\"application/fits\", not as \"image/fits\".

This means that \"image/fits\" SHOULD NOT be applied to FITS\nfiles containing MEF (multi-exposure-frame) mosaic images. Also,\nrandom groups files MUST be described as \"application/fits\" and not\nas \"image/fits\".\n\nA FITS file described with the media type \"image/fits\" is also valid\nas a file of media type \"application/fits\". The choice of\nclassification depends on the context and intended usage.\n\nRecommendations for application writers:\n\nAn application that is intended to handle \"image/fits\" SHOULD be able\nto provide a user with a manifest of all of the HDUs that are present\nin the file and with all of the keyword/value pairs from each of the\nHDUs. An application writer MAY choose to ignore HDUs beyond the\nPHDU, but even in this case the application SHOULD be able to present\nthe user with the keyword/value pairs from the PHDU.\n\nNote that an application intended to render \"image/fits\" for viewing\nby a user has significantly more responsibility than an application\nintended to handle, e.g., \"image/tiff\" or \"image/gif\". FITS data\narrays contain elements which typically represent the values of a\nphysical quantity at some coordinate location. Consequently they\nneed not contain any pixel rendering information in the form of\ntransfer functions, and there is no mechanism for color look-up\ntables. An application SHOULD provide this functionality, either\nstatically using a more or less sophisticated algorithm, or\ninteractively allowing a user various degrees of choice.\n\nFurthermore, the elements in a FITS data array may be integers or\nfloating-point numbers. The dynamic range of the data array values\nmay exceed that of the display medium and the eye, and their\ndistribution may be highly nonuniform. Logarithmic, square-root, and\nquadratic transfer functions along with histogram equalization\ntechniques have proved helpful for rendering FITS data arrays. Some\nelements of the array may have values which indicate that their data\nare undefined or invalid; these should be rendered distinctly. Via\nWCS Paper I [WCS1] the standard permits \"CTYPEnnn = 'COMPLEX'\" to\nassert that a data array contains complex numbers (future revisions\nmight admit other elements such as quaternions or general tensors).\n\nThree-dimensional data arrays (NAXIS=3 with NAXIS1, NAXIS2 and NAXIS3\n> 1) are of special interest. Applications intended to handle\n\"image/fits\" MAY default to displaying the first 2D plane of such an\nimage cube, or they MAY default to presenting such an image in a\nfashion akin to that used for an animated GIF, or they MAY present\nthe data cube as a mosaic of \"thumbnail\" images. Even in the absence\nof WCS indication of a temporal axis the time-lapse movie-looping\ndisplay technique can be effective, and application writers SHOULD\nconsider offering it for all three-dimensional arrays.\n\nAn \"image/fits\" PHDU with NAXIS=1 is describing a one-dimensional\nentity such as a spectrum or a time series. Applications intended to\nhandle \"image/fits\" MAY default to displaying such an image as a\ngraphical plot rather than as a two-dimensional picture with a single\nrow.\n\nAn application that cannot handle an image with dimensionality other\nthan 2 SHOULD gracefully indicate its limitations to its users when\nit encounters NAXIS=1 or NAXIS=3 cases, while still providing access\nto the keyword/value pairs.\n\nFITS files with degenerate axes (i.e., one or more NAXISn=1) MAY be\ndescribed as \"image/fits\", but the first axes SHOULD be non-\ndegenerate (i.e., the degenerate axes SHOULD be the highest\ndimensions). An algorithm designed to render only two-dimensional\nimages will be capable of displaying such an NAXIS=3 or NAXIS=4 FITS\narray that has one or two of the axes consisting of a single pixel,\nand an application writer SHOULD consider coding this capability into\nthe application. Writers of new applications which generate FITS\nfiles intended to be described as \"image/fits\" SHOULD consider using\nthe WCSAXES keyword [WCS1] to declare the dimensionality of such\ndegenerate axes, so that NAXIS can be used to convey the number of\nnon-degenerate axes.\n\nMagic number(s): \"SIMPLE = T\"\n\nJeff Uphoff of the National Radio Astronomy Observatory (NRAO) has\ncontributed database entries for the magic number file which is used\nby the Unix \"file\" command. Magic number files with these entries\nare distributed with a variety of Unix-like operating systems. In\naddition to recognizing a FITS file using the string given above, the\nUphoff entries also recognize the data type of the pixels in the\nPHDU.\n\nFile extension(s): fits\n\nThis file extension SHOULD NOT be interpreted as a prescription.\n\nThe FITS standard originated in the era when files were stored and\nexchanged via magnetic tape; it does not prescribe any nomenclature\nfor files on disk. Various sites within the FITS community have\nlong-established practices where files are presumed to be FITS by\ncontext. File extensions used at such sites commonly indicate\ncontent of the file instead of the data format.\n\nIn the absence of other information it is reasonably safe to presume\nthat a file name ending in \".fits\" is intended to be a FITS file.\nNevertheless, there are other commonly used extensions; e.g., \".fit\",\n\".fts\", and many others not suitable for listing in a media type\nregistration.\n\nIntended usage: Common\n\nPersons to contact for further information:\n\n\"Steve Allen\" <sla&ucolick.org>\n\"Don Wells\" <dwells&nrao.edu>\n\nAuthor/Change controller:\n\n\"Steve Allen\" <sla&ucolick.org>\n\nThe IAU FITS Working Group may authorize changes to this document."
