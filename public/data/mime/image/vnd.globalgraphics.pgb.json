It cannot include executable codes or \r\nmacros. The defined fields are mainly of a descriptive nature and provide information \r\nthat is required to correctly view and render the image by a recipient. As such, the \r\nfields currently defined in the TIFF specification do not in themselves create \r\nadditional security risks, since the fields are not used to induce any particular \r\nbehaviour by the recipient application.\r\n\r\nvnd.globalgraphics.pgb has an extensible structure, so that it is theoretically possible \r\nthat fields could be defined in the future which could be used to induce particular \r\nactions on the part of the recipient, thus presenting additional security risks, but \r\nthe decision as to what action that recipient should take will still be in the hands \r\nof the recipient.\r\n\r\nInteroperability considerations : \r\nThis media type will be used in the applications listed below. The recipient tool may \r\ndetermine from the header of the file whether or not they can appropriately process \r\nany particular instance.\r\n\r\nPublished specification : \r\nThe specification is privately held and made available to Global Graphics’ technology \r\npartners under non-disclosure agreements only.\r\n\r\nApplications which use this media : \r\nvnd.globalgraphics.pgb is intended to be used for the storage, archiving and transmission \r\nof raster data created by a Global Graphics Harlequin RIP, either by a Harlequin RIP, or \r\nby other tools using file reading technology licensed from Global Graphics\r\n\r\nAdditional information :\r\n\r\n1.
