    "security_considerations": "The .btif file is derived from the TIFF 6.0 image file \n    format. It contains bank check images and ASCII text \n    data (see attached btif specification, version 1.3).  \n    This is all passive data information. There is no executable \n    code contained in the file and no way for the file to \n    begin execution of any program contained on the user's \n    machine, nor on any remote system. In addition, there are \n    no directives of any kind contained in the file to cause \n    any pre-existing application to execute or to perform \n    any action.\n\n    There are two components of the .btif file. The first is \n    image data. The supported image compression formats are \n    G4 (CCITT Group 4), JPEG, ABIC, and IOCA/ABIC (ABIC compression \n    requires a special license from IBM).\n\n    The other component is information, in the form of ASCII \n    text, which contains index data about the check items such \n    as the issue date, paid date, amount, etc. for each check \n    contained in the file.\n\n    These image data segments and index information are not \n    explicitly encrypted within the specifications of the \n    BTIF file format.  Encryption can and should be employed \n    in communication layers above the BTIF file specification.  \n    For example, one means of encryption that Nations Bank \n    utilizes for its WEB applications is HTTPS which encrypts \n    all HTTP traffic and files including the BTIF files.  \n    Additional security measures are employed within the NationsBank \n    internal networks to protect the information.\n\n    On the client PC, the user would have to provide his own \n    security strategy to protect the contents of his BTIF files.",

It requires a unique MIME type to ensure that \n    only Nations Bank's plugins and helper applications will be \n    launched when attempting to read these image files.\n\n    The BTIF file format can contain image segments with compression \n    formats that are not contained in the TIFF 6.0 specification. \n    This means that standard TIFF readers will not be able to read \n    BTIF files that contain these proprietary compression types.  \n    This is another reason why a special MIME type is required.",
