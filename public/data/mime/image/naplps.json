NAPLPS (North American Presentation Layer\n\tProtocol Syntax) is used to transmit device-independent\n\tvector and raster graphics. Due to their spatial and\n\tcolor coordinate schemes, these graphics, sometimes\n\treferred to as \"frames\", are executable by virtually any\n\tdevice.\n\nRequired parameters: version identification\n\n\tFor example:\n\n\t\t\timage/naplps; version=1983\n\nOptional parameters: none\n\nEncoding considerations:\n\tAs NAPLPS is based on an extensible \"character set\"\n\tscheme which includes completely interchangeable 7-bit\n\tand 8-bit options, NAPLPS graphics may contain data in\n\teither 7-bit or 8-bit format. In order to avoid the need\n\tfor encoding and decoding, 7-bit NAPLPS character sets\n\tare recommended for all 7-bit environments.\n\nSecurity considerations: None.\n\nPublished specification:\n\tDocuments describing NAPLPS (North American Presentation\n\tLayer Protocol Syntax):\n\t\tANSI X3.110-1983\n\t\tCSA T500-1983\n\nPerson & email address to contact for further information:\n\tIlya Ferber\n\tYAM International\n\t43 Bashari Street\n\tRehovoth\n\tISRAEL\n\tiferber&netvision.net.il\n\n\n\n"
