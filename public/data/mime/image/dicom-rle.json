As such, it does not in itself create security risks beyond the information disclosed on viewing the image. There is no means to induce any particular behavior by the recipient application.\n\nThe media type does not provide any privacy or integrity services, so, if needed these may be provided externally, e.g., through the use of TLS or Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).\n\nThis media type employs compression, so users are warned that decompression may lead to significant increase in the size of the data.

In this role it may be used for single or multi-frame images, but does not take advantage of any inter-frame correlation (i.e., is a still image compression mechanism). When pixel data of a single frame is extracted from its DICOM encapsulated representation, it is highly desirable that such extracted pixel data be made available using web services and identified with a standard media type.\n\nFragment identifier considerations:\nDICOM RLE encodes single frame rasterized pixel data that is encoded in a compressed bit stream that is not fragmented and is decoded starting at the beginning of the bit stream. As such, no media type specific fragment identifier or fragment semantics are defined. In particularly no mechanism to selectively locate positions or sub-regions within an image is defined.\n\nRestrictions on usage:\nNone.\n\n\nProvisional registration?
