Our intent is to eventually, after \ndue discussion and review, submit the new pair for registration \nwith the IANA.\n\nTHE CHOICE OF CONTENT-TYPE/SUBTYPE PAIRS:\nSoftSource is currently proposing the following new MEDIA TYPE \nPAIRS:image/x-dwg, image/x-svf and image/x-dxf to the community \nfor consideration and comments.  These pairs are proposed to \nfacilitate the new Netscape Navigator plug-ins - one for viewing \nAutoCAD drawing and DXF files, and one for viewing SVF files (for \nCAD and general-purpose graphics; SVF is an acronym for Simple \nVector Format, a file format SoftSource jointly developed with \nNCSA).  These plug-ins were developed to help make an estimated \n(by Autodesk) one billion architectural,engineering and \nconstruction CAD drawings - in the form of DWG files - easily \navailable to all users.\n\nBoth plug-ins work with scaleable vector graphics allowing the \nuser to magnify portions of the drawing or toggle layer \nvisibility without requiring multiple downloads.  Thus,the zoom, \npan, and layer visibility controls of either plug-in make it a \nsnap to explore even the most complex CAD drawings online.  The \nSVF plug-in also features navigation via HTML hyperlinks adding \na host of elegant, new options for any application or context \nthat requires detailed, structured information and the power of \ngraphics.\n\nCHOICE OF CONTENT-TYPE:\nSoftSource has chosen to follow the example set by Computer \nGraphics Metafile (commonly called CGM).  CGM, a vector format, \nchose to place this file format under the content-type image.   \nThus, as the DWG, DXF and SVF subtypes are also vector files, we\nfeel it is most appropriate to include our proposed subtypes \nunder the same content-type as CGM.\n\nSECURITY CONSIDERATIONS:\nSince the DWG, DXF and SVF file formats are passive data, \nSoftSource does not foresee any security problems with these \nMedia type pairs.  However, we would appreciate comments or \nsuggestions should anyone in the community feel otherwise.\n\nOBJECT IDENTIFIERS:\nIf by object identifiers you mean a way to identify the file, \nthe following information is located at the beginning of each \nfile type.\n\nSVF\nAt the beginning of each SVF file you find the following - \nSVFv(then one or more numbers or a decimal point - to indicate \nthe version number -,followed by the null terminator zero).\n\nDWG\nIn a DWG file, the first 6 bytes in the file are AC(followed by \nfour numbers that indicate which version of AutoCAD created the \nfile).\n\nDXF\nThe only way to identify a DXF file is by its extension, .DXF.\n\nREFERENCES TO VERSIONS:\nDoes this refer to the release or version number of our plug-ins?  \nThe release or version number of the DWG/SVF/DXF file? The \nreference to versions is unclear.\n\nEXTERNAL PROFILING:\nAgain, we are not clear as to the meaning/context of the term \nexternal profiling.  \n\nREQUEST FOR CLARIFICATION:\nWe are unclear to the reference to OIDs for X.400 MHS.  We were \nunable to address this requirement need for mapping.\n\nBACKGROUND:\nThe proposing firm is SoftSource.  SoftSource has developed and \nmarketed software tools for Computer Aided Drafting (CAD) users \nsince 1982. Products include the highly rated AutoCAD add-ons, \nDRAWING Librarian and BLOCK Librarian. In 1990, SoftSource Built \nDXE, the industry-standard AutoCAD read-write application pro-\ngramming interface, now used by the world's largest CAD \ncompanies. DXE is the basis for the company's newest product \nunder development: a full-featured CAD system, designed to read \nand write AutoCAD and DXF file formats without translation. \nIt is slated for release in the first half of 1996.\n\u001a\n\nTO WHICH HARALD REPLIED, ON 3/15/96\n\nReturn-Path: <ietf-types-request&uninett.no>\nFrom: \"Harald.T.Alvestrand\" <Harald.T.Alvestrand&uninett.no>\nTo: Jodi Moline <jodim&softsource.com>\ncc: ietf-types&cs.utk.edu\nSubject: Re: Proposed Media Type (content-type/subtype)\nDate: Fri, 15 Mar 1996 13:18:48 +0100\nSender: Harald.T.Alvestrand&uninett.no\n\nYou seem to be using the RFC 1590 form for registrations.\nPlease use the RFC 1541 one instead; it's simpler.\n\nApart from that, note that:\n\n- X- types can't be registered.

In fact, .DXF is the\ndefacto standard.  It is publicly published.  In these niche communities\n.DXF and .DWG are practically ubiquitous.  Oxford University forms the\nEuropean group to establish the European standards for DXF read/write\ncapabilities.\n\n\n\n>- Are the DWG/DXF formats proprietary to AutoCAD? If so, do you have\n>  agreement from someone at AutoCAD (or whoever the vendor is)\n>  to publish these? (Or - displaying my ignorance - are you that\n>  vendor?)\n\nAll major CAD Companies read and write the .DWG and .DXF file formats.\n\n\n>- Is there a reference to a published specification for each of\n>  these three formats?\n>\n>On security, note that some (many?) file formats contain\n>extension fields that can be used for *anything*, and in fact\n>are often used for things like Word macros; do any of these\n>formats contain any such thing?\n\nAll three file formats can have *extra* data embedded in them.  None of the\ndata that is there however implies any standard for how the data gets\ninterpretted.  Especially anything as *live* as a macro -- it's just data.\n\n\n>\n>Apart from these points, this seems a reasonable thing to do.\n>\n>             Harald T.
