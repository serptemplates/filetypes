The \n   MIME subtype name may be 'heif-sequence' only if the file conforms \n   to the requirements of the 'msf1' brand, and contains that brand \n   as a compatible brand. (A brand in the file header identifies a \n   specific profile of a more general format.)\n\nRequired parameters: none\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n   profiles: Specified by RFC 6381 and its successors.\n\n   codecs: Specified by RFC 6381 and its successors for files \n      conforming to specifications derived from ISO/IEC 14496-12. \n      Note that for HEVC, the format of a list item included in the \n      value of the codecs parameter is specified in ISO/IEC 14496-15.\n      When the codecs parameter is present, the first list item \n      should represent a track having the handler type 'pict'.

Informatively, the syntax is BLInternal, ListItem1(, \n      ListItemN)*, where \n\n      BLInternal is 0 or 1; \n      each Listitem has the structure \n         OlsIdx.MaxTid.ProfileTierLevel1(.ProfileTierLevelN)*\n      and\n      OlsIdx and MaxTid are integers\n      ProfileTierLevelX is the substring specified for any HEVC \n         sample-entry for the codecs parameter\n\n   dependencies: as specified for the dependencies optional MIME \n      parameter of image/heif and image/heic MIME types.\n\nEncoding considerations: as for video/mp4\n\nSecurity considerations: See section 4 of RFC 4337 and section 7 of \n   RFC 6381.
