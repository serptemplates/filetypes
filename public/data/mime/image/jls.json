In the absence of a JFIF header, there is no mechanism to specify the color space of a multi-component image.\n\n\nPublished specification:\nThe baseline encoding of lossless and near-lossless images encoded with JPEG-LS is fully specified in ISO/IEC 14495-1 (ITU T.87).\n\nApplications which use this media:\nThough JPEG-LS is generally applicable to any type or natural or artificial color or monochrome images, it is primarily used in the medical field, particularly to encode the encapsulated pixel data of DICOM images. In this role it may be used for single or multi-frame images, but does not take advantage of any inter-frame correlation (i.e., is a still image compression mechanism). When pixel data of a single is extracted from its DICOM encapsulated representation, the compressed bit stream conforms to the JPEG-LS standard and it is highly desirable that such extracted data be made available using web services and identified with a standard media type that is recognized by non-medical (consumer) applications, such as web browsers, in much the same way, for example, as baseline JPEG (ISO/IEC 10918-1) is identified by the image/jpeg media type.\n\nNote that even though JPEG-LS is a product of ISO/IEC JTC1/SC29/WG1 and as such is part of the JPEG \"family\" of standards, just as JPEG 2000 is, like JPEG 2000, which has a media type assigned of image/jp2 [RFC3745], JPEG-LS needs its own media type.\n\n\nFragment identifier considerations:\nJPEG-LS encodes single frame rasterized pixel data that is encoded in a compressed bit stream that is not fragmented and is decoded starting at the beginning of the bit stream. As such, no media type specific fragment identifier or fragment semantics are defined. In particularly no mechanism to selectively locate positions or sub-regions within an image is defined.\n\nRestrictions on usage:\nPayment free licensing of patents claimed to be of relevance for the implementation of JPEG-LS are discussed in Annex I of ISO/IEC 14495-1.\n\nProvisional registration?
