(A brand in the \n      file header identifies a specific profile of a more general \n      format.)\n\n   The use of subtype values is constrained as follows: \n\n   The MIME subtype name may be 'heic' only if the file conforms to \n   the requirements of the 'heic', 'heix', 'heim', or 'heis' brand, \n   and contains at least one of those brands as a compatible brand. \n   The MIME subtype name may be 'heif' only if the file conforms to \n   the requirements of the 'mif1' brand, and contains that brand as a \n   compatible brand.\n\nRequired parameters: none\n\nOptional parameters:\n\n   profiles: Specified by RFC 6381 and its successors.\n\n   codecs: Specified by RFC 6381 and its successors for files \n      conforming to specifications derived from ISO/IEC 14496-12. \n      Note that for HEVC, the format of a list item included in the \n      value of the codecs parameter is specified in ISO/IEC 14496-15.\n\n   itemtypes: One or more comma-separated item descriptions. \n\n      Each item description corresponds to the type of one or more \n      image items included in the file, in any order. An item \n      description should be present for the primary item of the file \n      and may be present for other image items of the file. \n\n      Each item description starts with an item type string and is \n      followed by a plus-separated ('+') list of zero or more item \n      property strings. \n\n      An item type string starts with the four-character item_type \n      value of the item and may be followed by zero or more \n      dot-separated ('.') qualifiers specified below. The field \n      item_type is defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12.\n\n      When the item type is a four-character code of a coded image, \n      it may be followed by a dot-separated ('.') value, as specified \n      for the codecs parameter of the ISO base media file format name \n      space in RFC 6381. For the item type 'hvc1', the value after \n      the '.' is the profile-tier-level value as specified in ISO/IEC \n      14496-15.\n\n      When the item type is a four-character code of a derived image \n      item, it may be followed by a dot-separated ('.') pixel count \n      value that is the positive decimal integer indicating the \n      number of pixels that is required for the input images of the \n      derived image item and the reconstructed image itself. For the \n      item type 'hvc1', the pixel count value must be present for an \n      item description, when that pixel count value is greater than \n      twice the largest pixel count inferred from the \n      profile-tier-level value of any coded image of the same item \n      description list.\n\n      An item property string consists of the box-type of an item \n      property marked as essential. The list of the item property \n      strings must indicate the entire set of item properties that \n      are marked as essential. The item property strings must appear \n      in the order they are associated with the image item in the \n      file.\n\n   lhevcptl: For multi-layer image items, specifies the decoding \n      capabilities required for different combinations of layers and \n      temporal sub-layers; the syntax and semantics are specific to \n      HEVC and are formally specified by the lhevcptl optional MIME \n      parameter in ISO/IEC 14496-15 for the L-HEVC sample entry \n      types. Informatively, the syntax is BLInternal, ListItem1(, \n      ListItemN)*, where \n\n      BLInternal is 0 or 1; \n      each Listitem has the structure \n         OlsIdx.MaxTid.ProfileTierLevel1(.ProfileTierLevelN)*\n      and\n      OlsIdx and MaxTid are integers\n      ProfileTierLevelX is the substring specified for any HEVC \n         sample-entry for the codecs parameter\n\n   dependencies: a list of comma-separated URLs (see RFC 3986) from \n      the DataReferenceBoxes in the top-level MetaBox and all tracks. \n      The DataReferenceBoxes indicating a reference to the same file \n      as the container file must not be listed. The URLs should be \n      relative whenever possible. Note that the URLs are often, but \n      not required to be, relative, and that some characters in URLs \n      may require escaping in some situations. DataReferenceBox and \n      MetaBox are specified in ISO/IEC 14496-12.\n\nEncoding considerations: as for video/mp4\n\nSecurity considerations: See section 4 of RFC 4337 and section 7 of \n   RFC 6381.
