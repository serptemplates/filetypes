It is\n      specified in IS 8632:1992 Parts 1-4. It can handle vector graphics and\n      images. It stores pictures in a way which is independent of any\n      particular software, computer or graphics device. \n\n      CGM offers the Internet community the first option for a vector-based \n      (i.e., line-art) image type.  Currently, the valid image types are JPEG, \n      and GIF, both raster or bitmap type image files.  Vector images allow for \n      greater detail and clarity at multiple zoom levels. Also, they are usually \n      much more compact than the equivalent bitmap.\n\n      CGM is used by a number of other standards including the Office Document \n      Architecture (ODA) standard, ATA within the commercial aviation industry, \n      J2008 within the automotive industry and the CALS (Computer-aided \n      Acquisition and Logistics Support) specification of the US Dept of Defence. \n      The CGM can be used to exchange pictures between different types of \n      applications. CAE/CAD, graphic arts, business graphics and desk top \n      publishing packages can all use the CGM to exchange graphical information. \n\n      More than 300 applications can generate and/or interpret CGM files.\n      There are a number of public domain CGM generators and interpreters \n      available.\n\n      Parameters and Encoding\n\n      The CGMs should use the binary encoding, as specified in \n      IS 8632:1992 Part 3.  \n\n      Valid version numbers are those specified in ISO 8632:1992 and any \n      amendments. (Currently Versions 1, 2 and 3 are specified in ISO 8632:1992 \n      and version 4 is specified in IS 8632:1992 Amendment 2 (1995) which adds \n      Application Structures which can be used to support hyper-links.)\n      The versions are upward compatible in the sense that a valid Version 1\n      metafile is a valid Version 2 metafile, Version 2 is a subset of Version\n      3, and Version 3 is a subset of Version 4.\n     \n      The version number in this parameter must be the same as the version \n      number within the CGM file itself.  It is recommended that only Version 1 \n      CGMs be used initially because most current software handles \n      Version 1 CGMs. It is expected that in the next year or two software \n      will be upgraded to handle version 3 and 4 CGMs.  Version 2 is not \n      expected to be widely used as a target implementation level.\n\n      Profiles are used to specify limits, for example the maximum number\n      of points in a polygon or the set of fonts which can be used. \n      Reliable CGM interchange can only be assured with CGMs conforming \n      to one of the principal profiles. The profile declared in this parameter\n      must be the same as the profile declared within the CGM itself.\n\n      Valid profiles are those registered with ISO as International \n      Standardized Profiles (ISP). The Model Profile, as specified in \n      IS 8632:1992 Amendment 1, and three others are being registered \n      as ISPs (DISP 12071-1 Basic Scientific and Technical, DISP 12071-2 \n      Advanced Scientific and Technical, DISP 12071-3 Basic Presentation \n      and Visualisation (Model Profile), DISP 12071-4 Advanced \n      Presentation and Visualisation). \n\n\n      Acknowledgements\n\n      The following people have contributed towards this registration proposal:\n      Alan Francis (Page Description, UK)\n      Brian DiAntonio (Electronic Book Technologies/Carberry, US) \n      Dr Anne Mumford (Advisory Group on Computer Graphics, UK)\n      Lofton Henderson (Henderson Software Inc, US)\n      Steve Carson (GSC Associates, US)\n\n\n      Contact: Alan Francis\n      Email: A.H.Francis&open.ac.uk\n      Phone: +44 1908 316921\n      Address: Page Description, 6 Spencer St, New Bradwell, Milton Keynes,\n               MK13 0DW, UK.\n\n\n\n\n"
