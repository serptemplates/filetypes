In such\nschemes it is not possible for a small amount of data to expand\nenormously because the level of compression is limited; the compressed\nsize is related directly to the number of pixels in the uncompressed\nimage and not to the content of the data.\n\nWhen variable-rate compression is used, the format includes information\nas to the expected size of the uncompressed data.
