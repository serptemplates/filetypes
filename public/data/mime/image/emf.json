It\n   is also possible that EMF+ data is \"safe\" while EMF data contains\n   an exploit (or vice versa); the EMF+-aware implementation (such as\n   an application designed for GDI+ on Windows XP or above) would\n   skip the \"unsafe\" data while another implementation would fall\n   prey to the exploit.\n\n   As a \"basic\" image format, the image/emf media type does not\n   employ executable content and provides no facilities for privacy\n   or integrity.",
