MICE won the 2007 Pwnie Award for \"Mass\n   0wnage\" and \"Breaking the Internet\".  The official Microsoft\n   security bulletin describes that the flaw occurs because Windows\n   Metafiles can set the SETABORTPROC value of the MetafileEscapes\n   enumeration (accessible via the META_ESCAPE record), allowing for\n   arbitrary code execution, i.e., \"active content\".\n\n   Windows Metafiles can contain Enhanced Metafiles using the\n   META_ESCAPE_ENHANCED_METAFILE record; thus, the security\n   considerations of EMF apply to WMF.\n\n   Windows Metafiles are historically very buggy.  As the original\n   intent was to replicate Windows GDI calls, flaws in GDI, or in a\n   display or printer driver implementing the backend to GDI, could\n   be exploitable.  WMF implementations not backed by Windows GDI\n   have different risks: namely, while a malicious WMF author may not\n   consider the non-Windows GDI implementation as a primary target,\n   WMF has many \"corner case\" records for which an implementation's\n   processing may not have received the same level of scrutiny as the\n   Windows implementation.  \"Fuzzing\" the implementation is\n   appropriate.\n\n   As a \"basic\" image format, the image/wmf media type does not\n   employ executable content and provides no facilities for privacy\n   or integrity.",

Accordingly,\n   there is a large body of free and commercially available clip art\n   that is still in use, either independently or embedded in\n   productivity documents (word processing documents, desktop\n   publishing documents, slideshows, presentations, spreadsheets, and\n   workbooks).  For example, references to WMF content appear (non-\n   normatively) in Office Open XML.  To say that support for this\n   format is necessary for interoperability would not be an\n   understatement.\n\n   Accommodations for comments or arbitrary data storage in Windows\n   Metafiles are virtually non-existent.  However, Windows Metafiles\n   can contain Enhanced Metafiles using the\n   META_ESCAPE_ENHANCED_METAFILE record, so an implementation that\n   handles Windows Metafiles is also expected to handle enhanced\n   metafile content.  Windows Metafiles can store and output text\n   strings (see META_TEXTOUT and META_EXTTEXTOUT records), but the\n   encodings of the strings may be ambiguous.

The value of this parameter is a charset from\n      the IANA \"Character Sets\" registry\n      <http://www.iana.org/assignments/character-sets>.  When this\n      parameter is not specified, DEFAULT_CHARSET has the following\n      meaning in the WMF specification: \"a character set based on the\n      current system locale; for example, when the system locale is\n      United States English, the default character set is\n      ANSI_CHARSET\" (which is Windows-1252, more or less).  That is,\n      when not specified, the default character set is system\n      dependent.  This optional parameter is new to this registration\n      and may not enjoy widespread support for some time.
