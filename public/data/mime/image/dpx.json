    "encoding_considerations": "Security considerations: DPX files only encode images with corresponding metadata and do not employ executable content.\n\nThe header defines a \"user-defined information\" section that can contain arbitrary binary data. As such, a maliciously coded file could contain a binary blob comprising executable content. Therefore, the user-defined header must not contain executable content, and implementations that receive, display, or otherwise process images must preclude the execution of any executable content that might be received.\n\nSome files also contain a “standards-based metadata” section that can include arbitrary XML. Such XML could include potentially harmful or malicious links to other resources.\n\nImplementations will need to ensure that a received file can be handled within the available memory. DPX allows run-length encoding, so decoders will need suitable bounds checks to ensure that memory locations outside the allocated decoded image buffer cannot be altered.\n\nDPX files do not have integral encryption or authentication. A 32-bit “encryption key” field is defined in SMPTE ST 268-1, but the standard does not specify an encryption algorithm; therefore, utilizing the field for encrypting picture data will generally not be interoperable. Any file protection, privacy, or integrity requirements must be handled using an external mechanism.\n\nInteroperability considerations: SMPTE ST 268-1 has been very widely used since it was standardized (initially as SMPTE 268M:1994) but has experienced some interoperability issues in practice. These issues have occurred primarily due to conflicting interpretations relating specifically to how the pixel data is ordered, packed, and padded. SMPTE ST 268-2 has improved interoperability due to the inclusion of metadata that resolves ambiguities that are present in SMPTE ST 268-1. However, SMPTE ST 268-2 is a more recent standard, whereas SMPTE ST 268-1 has been widely used for many years prior and is employed in voluminous archives. There are multiple editions of SMPTE ST 268-1 and SMPTE ST 268-2. Features can be added between editions while the media type remains unchanged. Accordingly, a reader that conforms to an earlier edition might not interpret all the files that conform to the most recent edition.\n\nBoth SMPTE ST 268-1 and SMPTE ST 268-2 define core fields and values. Files must include all core fields, and reader or receiver implementations must interpret all core fields and values.\n\nPublished specification: SMPTE ST 268-1; SMPTE ST 268-2 (which incorporates SMPTE ST 268-1 by reference)\n\nApplications which use this media: DPX is derived from Kodak's Cineon format and is used primarily as a file format for digitization of camera-captured frames and as a digital intermediate file format.\n\nFragment identifier considerations: N/A\n\nRestrictions on usage: N/A",
