      "Excel is a spreadsheet application included in the Microsoft Office suite. The software comes with .XLTX templates for various categories, such as Business, Personal, Budgets, and Charts",
      "XLTM files are similar to XLTX files. However, XLTM files support macros, which are a series of commands a user has grouped so they can quickly execute a repetitive or complex task, such as formatting a document, entering data, or performing calculations.",
      "To save a spreadsheet as an XLTM file with Microsoft Excel, select File → Save As, then choose \"Excel Macro-Enabled Template\" from the format dropdown menu.",
      "NOTE: If you want to create a spreadsheet from an XLTM template that still supports macros, you must save it as an XLSM file. But if you want to create a spreadsheet from an XLTM template that does not need to support macros, you can save it as an .XLSX file."

  "more_information": {
    "description": [
      "An XLTM file is a macro-enabled spreadsheet template created by Microsoft Excel. In addition to one or more macros, it may store settings, layout information, and spreadsheet data. Excel users save spreadsheets as XLTM files when they look to create multiple spreadsheets (primarily .XLSM) with the same information and layout."
    ]
  },
  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open XLTM files in Microsoft Excel (Windows, Mac, iOS, Android). Excel 2007 and later versions can open XLSM files by default, and earlier versions can open XLSM files if you have installed the Microsoft Office Compatibility Pack. For security reasons, Excel does not enable XLTM files' macros by default. To enable macros in an XLTM file, click Enable Macros when prompted.",
      "After you open your XLTM file in Excel, you can either edit the template the XLTM file contains, or you can use the XLTM file to create a new spreadsheet."
