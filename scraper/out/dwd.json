      "The Davka Corporation publishes software products that promote Jewish customs and traditions, as well as the Hebrew language. To that end, the company's word processing program, DavkaWriter, supports both English and Hebrew writing. For example, it includes a Hebrew dictionary, thesaurus, and translation tool.",
      "Documents saved in DavkaWriter are typically saved as DWD files. However, different versions of DavkaWriter use different versions of the DWD format. For example, if you share a DWD file created in a newer version of DavkaWriter with someone who uses an old version of the program, they may not be able to open the file. To circumvent this problem, you must export your file in the old version of the DWD format (by selecting File → Export and exporting as the DavkaWriter, Older Version file type)."

      "A DWD file is a document created by DavkaWriter, an English and Hebrew word processor. Like a .DOCX file, a DWD file can contain formatted text, images, and shapes. Unlike most DOCX files, at least some of the text a DWD file contains is likely written in Hebrew."

      "You can open a DWD file in DavkaWriter (Windows, Mac). If your document was created by a newer version of DavkaWriter, and you are attempting to open the file in an older version, it may not open. In that case, you (or the person who created the DWD file) must use the newer version of DavkaWriter to export the file in the older DWD format."
