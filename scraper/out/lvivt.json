      "The LVIVT format acts as a wrapper for the game's executable, meaning it does not contain playable game data on its own. Instead, the file must be decoded to restore the original EXE file before the game can be launched. Encoding the file helps preserve the integrity of the game's internal resources, such as scripts, assets, or compiled logic, ensuring that the program behaves as intended.",

      "An LVIVT file is an encrypted game file created by Lvivtotoro, an independent game developer known for lightweight Windows-based games. It stores an executable file (.EXE file) in an encoded format, preventing users from directly running or modifying the original game executable. Developers typically use the LVIVT format to protect game data, prevent tampering, or securely manage distribution of the game."

      "You can open or decode an LVIVT file with the Lvivtotoro decompiler.exe program, which extracts the EXE file from the encrypted container. Once decoded, the resulting executable can be run like a standard Windows program."
