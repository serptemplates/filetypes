      "VirtuosoWorks NOTION is a now-discontinued scorewriter that allowed composers to create, edit, and play back musical scores. Most notably, NOTION used audio samples recorded by the London Symphony Orchestra, specifically for use with NOTION, to play back users' scores. This gave NOTION's playback a realistic, live performance-esque sound.",
      "NOTION saved the scores that composers created as NTN files. When opened in NOTION, these scores appear as editable sheet music, consisting of a score title, author name, measures, notes, rests, tempo notation, and other musical notation."
