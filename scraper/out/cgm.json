      "CGM files are encoded using one of three different methods:",
      "Binary encoding - Standard file encoding that enables software programs to read the file quickly and efficiently.",
      "Character-based encoding - Produces the smallest possible file size, which saves disk space and allows for faster data transfers.",
      "Clear-text encoding - Allows users to read and understand the contents of the file and modify the file using a basic text editor."

      "Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) is free, platform-independent, international standard metafile format for storing and exchanging vector graphics (2D), raster graphics, and text. CGM uses an object-oriented approach and many function provisions for image production. CGM uses these object-oriented characteristics for remolding graphical elements to render an image. A metafile contains necessary information that defines other files. In CGM, a text-based source file contains all graphical elements that can be later compiled into a binary file. Basically, CGM is a way to facilitate 2D graphical data interchange, independent from any particular platform, or device.\n\nCGM format provides different elements to perform functions, and signify objects to adjust geometric primitives and graphical information. Although CGM has been superseded by other formats to display graphic arts on web pages as it is not well supported by web pages, still very popular among industrial, aeronautical, and other technical applications. Though World Wide Web Consortium has developed WebCGM, an alternative approach for the use of CGM on the Web. The primary CGM implementation was an illustration of the sequence of basic operations of the Graphical Kernel System (GKS). It has not been much adopted in professional designs but has largely supplanted by other formats such as DXF and SVG.",
      "A CGM file is an image saved in a vector graphics format designed to support the needs of many graphics applications. It was originally used for clip art libraries, but newer revisions (based on the ISO/IEC 8632 standard) are now commonly used for CAD drawings."
