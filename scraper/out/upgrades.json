      "In Bloons Tower Defense (BTD), players attempt to stop balloons from escaping a maze by placing weapon-wielding towers around that maze. During the game, players can purchase upgrades for each tower they place. Each tower has its own, unique upgrade path, defined in an UPGRADES file.",
      "UPGRADES files are plain text files, which specify a tower's upgrade path using JSON-formatted text. While most players will never encounter BTD UPGRADES files, modders may be interested in opening the files and modifying the upgrade paths they define."
