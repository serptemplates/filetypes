      "A file with .drc extension is a compressed 3D file format created with Google Draco library. Google offers Draco as open source library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric meshes and point clouds, and improves storage and transmission of 3D graphics. It encodes the input data and saves it as .drc file. At the receiving end, the API reads .drc files and can output these as PLY or OBJ files. The compressed output file enables users to download apps faster and provide quick loading of 3D graphics in browsers.",
      "Contains copy-protection information stored in an OMA (Open Mobile Alliance) rights object, formatted in WBXML (WAP Binary XML); includes the key used to encrypt the content of a .DCF file; enables Digital Rights Management (DRM) encrypted files to be opened and played back."
