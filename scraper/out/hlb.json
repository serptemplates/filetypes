      "VMS/VAX systems were standard in the 1980s and 1990s, and Digital Equipment Corporation renamed VMS/VAX to OpenVMS in 1992. The system was eventually deprecated, making HLB files largely obscure. However, some organizations still use OpenVMS, and users needing technical assistance with OpenVMS may still access HLB files."

      "An HLB file is a help library used by the Virtual Memory System (VMS) operating system for Virtual Address eXtension (VAX) computers developed by Digital Equipment Corporation. It contains help documentation in a structured format that users can access via VMS/VAX system commands and then navigate to learn how to use various system features or software applications."
