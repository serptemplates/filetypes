      "Jason Nunn developed and released UNIS Composer 669 in 1994. Users could compose music with UNIS Composer 669 by arranging sequences of sound samples, which they played back in a loop or pattern.",
      "The 669 format is similar to the more popular .MOD format, another tracker format from the same period. While 669 files were common among music tracker enthusiasts, the 669 format is now a legacy format."

      "A 669 file is a module created by UNIS Composer 669, an early music tracker program popular in the DOS era. It supports up to eight audio channels, each containing a sequence of notes or patterns created with user-specified sound samples. Musicians created compositions with UNIS Composer 669, often for video games, and saved their work as 669 files to preserve their work."
