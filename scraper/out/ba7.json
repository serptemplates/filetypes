      "TaxAct 2017 users will most likely only use the TA7 file to save, print, or upload their taxes. However, the BA7 file is helpful for backing up a TA7 file in case it becomes corrupt or is lost.",
      "To save a backup of your tax return select File → Backup... and name your file. You must save your tax return as a TA7 file before creating your backup. To restore a backup in TaxAct, select File → Restore Backup... and navigate to the location of your BA7 file.",
      "Since annual tax returns are filed for the previous year, the BA7 file is created in 2018 typically from the beginning of January to April 15. Once you have completed a tax return, you can either print and mail in the tax forms or file electronically."

      "A BA7 file is a backup file of a .TA7 2017 tax return created with the 2017 version of TaxAct, a tax-preparation program. It contains tax data for the 2017 tax year, which is used for archival purposes and in case the TA7 file is lost or becomes corrupt. BA7 files store federal IRS and state tax form data along with the user's basic information."
