      "The JMCP file is one of several file extensions created by JM-Crypt software. Other file extensions include \".jmcx\", \".jmck\", \".jmcr\", and \".jmce\". The encrypted files are commonly used to secure confidential personal files and sensitive business files.",
      "The JM-Crypt algorithm uses the one-time pad (OTP) encryption method and twice encrypts the file. The first encryption is with a random extract of a long random key generated by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) key generator, which is unique to JM-Crypt Security. The second encryption includes password protection that depends on the method selected by the user, which may be fully automatic (random auto-generated password used by the JMCX file), semi-automatic (project mode, which is utilized by the JMCP file), or manual (a password created by the user and featured in the .JMC file).",
      "NOTE: You need the JM-Crypt software and algorithm that were used to originally encrypt the file in order to decrypt the JMCP file."
