      "An EVENT file is a hidden file created by various Corel applications, including Video Studio and PaintShop Photo Express (discontinued). The Corel app creates an EVENT file in each folder the app has cataloged. EVENT files contain records about whether the app has modified the folder's contents over time (e.g. if picture files have been added or removed)."
