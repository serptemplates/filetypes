      "While most video files created using MPEG-2 compression (such as .MPG and .MPEG files) contain both video and audio data, M2V files contain only video. M2V files are most often used to create DVD movies, because many DVD-authoring tools require users to import separate video and audio files.",
      "Some video-editing programs, such as Adobe Premiere and After Effects, allow users to export their videos in the M2V format. Users can then use DVD-authoring applications, such as DVD Flick and CyberLink Power Director, to combine their M2V file with an audio file and produce a finalized movie."

      "The M2V file format is a file extension commonly associated with MPEG-2 Video. MPEG-2 is widely used video compression standard that is often used for DVDs, digital television broadcasting and other video distribution methods. The M2V format specifically contains only video data, which means it does not include audio or any other multimedia components. It is essentially raw or elementary stream of video.\n\nM2V files can be used for various purposes, including authoring DVDs or creating video content for broadcast. When creating DVDs, for example, M2V video stream is typically paired with separate audio file in formats like AC3 or LPCM to create complete DVD video.\n\nTo use M2V files in video editing or authoring software, you might need to combine them with an appropriate audio file, create menus and structure your content for DVD authoring or another distribution format.\n\nM2V files are generally not intended for direct playback on most media players or video editing software because they lack audio and other necessary components for complete video experience. Instead, they are part of larger multimedia project or distribution package.",
      "An M2V file is a video file encoded using MPEG-2 compression. It contains only video data and does not contain any audio or subtitles. M2V files are commonly used by DVD-authoring applications, which pair M2V files with audio files (such as .M2A and .WAV files) to create movies."
