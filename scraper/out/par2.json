      "Parchive is a program that allows users to create parity volumes associated with a group of files. Using the parity volumes, users can restore any files that go missing from the group or become damaged. For example, if a user shares a set of files online, and one of the files becomes corrupted, other users can use the parity volumes associated with that group of files to restore the corrupted file.",
      "The second version of Parchive, known as Parchive 2 or PAR2, saves parity volumes as PAR2 files. It also saves a small index file, used to identify and verify the integrity of associated files, with the .par2 extension."
