      "The AVCHD format was introduced in 2006 after being jointly developed by Sony and Panasonic, primarily for use in high definition consumer camcorders. As a format, AVCHD favors comparably to .HDV and is a format which is acceptable for professional use.",
      "Playback of the AVCHD format is not supported across all Blu-ray Disc players as even though AVCHD does share many format similarities with Blu-ray Disc, it is not part of the Blu-ray Disc specification.",
      "NOTE: There is a known incompatibility of the AVCHD format within the Panasonic brand's original HD Writer importing and editing software, which shipped from 2006 to 2008. This version of HD Writer cannot recognize the current 1080i format or newer formats like 1080p50 or 1080p60. The newer HD Writer AE can in fact read the newer 1080i format while versions 2 and higher can read 1080p (in both frame rates)."

      "An AVCHD file is a recording file format introduced for saving high-definition(HD) videos to DVDs, hard disk drives, and memory cards. AVCHD videos, recorded onto DVD and Blu-ray, can be played easily on most Blu-ray Disc players. Also, the AVCHD stuff can also be recorded on SD cards and played by many Blu-ray Disc players, television sets, and media consoles. The ffdshow tryouts and Libavcodec are the open-source codecs that can decode the AVCHD files.",
      "A file-based format for digital recording and playback of high-definition video; its name is an acronym which stands for Advanced Video Coding High Definition."
