      "A .CAF file typically refers to a “Cal3D Binary Animation File.” Cal3D is an open-source 3D character animation library often used in video game development and other interactive 3D applications. These “.caf” files are specifically designed to store binary animation data for characters or objects created using Cal3D framework.\n\nCAF files play a crucial role in imparting realistic human-like movements to characters. They define animations for various actions such as walking, running or any other dynamic actions that character might perform. Cal3D animations can also be represented in an XML format, using files with a “.xaf” extension. This XML representation provides an alternative way to store and manipulate animation data within Cal3D."
