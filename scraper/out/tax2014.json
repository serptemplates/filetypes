      "TurboTax can import data from a previous year into a new TAX2014 document. Simply create a new return in TurboTax and select \"Transfer Return\" when prompted. To import data from 2013, select the tax return with the .TAX2013 extension. You can also import data from TaxACT and H&R Block Tax files.",
      "A TAX2014 file can be saved by the desktop version of TurboTax or exported from TurboTax Online. To export a TAX2014 file from TurboTax Online, click \"Tools,\" then select \"Save your 2014 return to your computer.\" You can then open the return in the desktop version of TurboTax. You can also open a tax return saved on a Mac in the Windows version of TurboTax and vice versa. However, you may have to add the file extension \".tax2014\" to the Mac file if it was not added automatically.",
      "Once you have completed a tax return, you can either print and mail the tax forms or file electronically. The \"e-file\" process is typically free for federal returns, but there may be a fee to file the state return electronically.",
      "NOTE: You can password-protect your TAX2014 file by adding a password when you save the file. This will encrypt the data to protect your personal financial data and will require a password in order to open the file."
