      "AutoHotkey is an open-source tool that allows users to execute complex or repetitive tasks with the press of a button. For example, users can use AutoHotkey scripts to autocorrect documents' spelling, perform Google searches from their desktop, and quickly enter the same information in a number of repetitive forms.",
