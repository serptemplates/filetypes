      "Researchers, engineers, and analysts use RNQ files to simulate and analyze system performance. In a DES model, systems are represented as sequences of events that occur at specific points in time.",
      "DES model examples include a customer arriving at a service desk, a machine beginning a task, or an item being shipped. These simulations enable users to test various scenarios, identify bottlenecks, and inform data-driven decisions without impacting real-world operations."

      "An RNQ file contains a simulation model created with Renque, a discrete event simulation (DES) tool. It stores the complete setup of a simulation, including system components, event logic, timing rules, and data collection settings. RNQ files can represent a wide range of processes, including business operations, manufacturing systems, and service workflows."
