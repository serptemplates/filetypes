      "The XPS format was designed as a replacement for the Enhanced Metafile (.EMF) format. It is similar to the PDF format, but is based on XML instead of PostScript.",
      "Windows users can save a document as an XPS file by selecting Microsoft XPS Document Writer as the printer when printing (similar to how users can save a document as a PDF file by selecting Microsoft Print to PDF). After you save a document as an XPS file, you can no longer edit it. You can, however, open, view, sign, and manage the file's permissions in Microsoft XPS Viewer.",
      "Old versions of Windows (Vista to 10) came pre-installed with Microsoft XPS Viewer. In later releases of Windows 10, Microsoft stopped installing XPS Viewer by default. Instead, XPS Viewer is now an optional feature that Windows 10 and 11 users can enable if they choose."

      "An XPS file represents page layout files that are based on XML Paper Specifications created by Microsoft. It was developed as a replacement of EMF file format and is similar to PDF file format, but uses XML in layout, appearance, and printing information of a document. It is, in fact, more justified to say that XPS is an attempt on PDF, but couldn’t get enough popularity as owned by PDF for many reasons. Microsoft provides XPS Document Writer by default from Windows 7 onwards for the creation of XPS files. XPS files can be generated by selecting the “Microsoft XPS Document Writer” as printer while printing the document.\n\nXPS viewers come integrated as part of Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Internet Explorer 6 or later. XPS files become read-only once they are generated. This adds to the user’s confidence in received documents sent as XPS for the authenticity of the document. An XPS document can contain one or more pages as converted from the original document.",
      "An XPS file is a document that contains fixed page layout information written in the XPS page description language. The file defines a document's layout, appearance, and printing information. XPS files are similar to .PDF files, but saved in Microsoft’s proprietary XPS format."
