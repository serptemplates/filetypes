      "Heroes of Might and Magic V is a popular turn-based strategy game published by Ubisoft. The game enjoys a healthy modding community, which creates and distributes mods saved as H5U files.",
      "Each H5U file is a renamed .ZIP file that contains all the mod's assets. To install the mod an H5U file contains, a player must place it in Heroes of Might and Magic V's UserMODs directory. To uninstall a mod, all a player must do is delete the mod's H5U file from the UserMODs directory (and relaunch the game).",
      "NOTE: In the past, Heroes of Might and Magic V mods were saved as .PAK files. With the release of The Tribes of the East expansion, players began saving and distributing mods as H5U files instead."
