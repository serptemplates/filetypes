      "SITX archives support long filenames, UNIX (macOS) and Windows file permissions, and built-in error correction, which helps recover data from transmission errors. They also offer password protection with 512-bit RC4 encryption and other encryption methods like AES, DES, and Blowfish. Starting with StuffIt 9, the format also includes JPEG compression, reducing image file sizes by 15–30% without losing quality.",
      "NOTE: Initially developed by Aladdin Systems (later Allume Systems), Smith Micro now maintains StuffIt. While Mac users commonly used SITX archives in the 2000s, they have become less common as .ZIP and other modern compression formats gained popularity."

      "A file with .sitx extension is a compressed archive file created with StuffIt software. This format was introduced as an extension to the original standard Stuffit (.sit) file format and offers comparatively more compression to its predecessor. SITX files are more compact and occupy less space along with the support for 512-bit compression aimed for security. SITX files are recognized by their Internet media types as application/x-stuffitx and application/x-sitx with Uniform Type Identifier as com.stuffit.archive.sitx.",
      "A SITX file is a compressed archive created by StuffIt 7.0 and later. It features Smith Micro’s ATOM compression technology, providing higher compression rates than the older .SIT format. The SITX format is designed to maintain file integrity across different operating systems by preserving metadata, file attributes, and folder structures during compression."
