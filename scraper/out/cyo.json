      "Data analysts, legal teams, and information managers who need to identify duplicates or near-duplicates across large sets of documents are the primary users of Clustify. The software uses text analysis and similarity detection algorithms to help users organize extensive document collections, such as those used in e-discovery, research, or content management.",
      "After processing the documents, the program generates a CYO file to record the clustering results. The file acts as a bridge between Clustify's internal processing and the user's ability to review or use the clustering results in other tools."
