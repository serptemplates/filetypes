      "A file with a .CDR extension containing “Raw CD Audio Data” typically holds digital information extracted directly from the source tracks of an audio CD. This “raw” designation signifies that the data is unprocessed, preserving the original binary structure as it exists on the physical disc. The content includes the precise audio samples alongside subcode information like track timings. These .CDR files are not designed for direct playback in standard media players. Instead, they serve as a fundamental resource for specialized tasks such as professional CD mastering, precise audio editing, and authoring new CDs. Specialized software applications for audio production and CD burning utilize this raw data to generate finished audio CDs or to transcode it into more common, playable formats like WAV or MP3.\n\nIf you need to work with .cdr files containing “Raw CD Audio Data,” you would typically use specialized audio software to process or convert them, as they are not standard audio files that can be played in most media players.",
      "A CDR file is a drawing created with CorelDRAW, a vector illustration and page layout design application included with CorelDRAW Graphics Suite. It typically contains vector image data, such as lines, paths, and colored shapes, but may also include text, tables, and digital effects. The CDR format is commonly used for documents, such as brochures, tabloids, letters, advertisements, postcards, webpages, and web banners."
