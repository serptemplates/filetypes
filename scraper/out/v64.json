      "Doctor V64 is an unofficial tool that players could purchase and connect to their N64 to back up their game data. The device saved users' game data files as V64 files. Each V64 file contained an exact copy of the N64 game it was created from, as well as a copy of a player's save data. Players could export V64 files from and load V64 files into Doctor V64.",
