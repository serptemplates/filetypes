      "A .ifo file is an information file that is part of DVD specifications. The acronym IFO stands for information. IFO files provide information about the contents of the disc to the DVD player such as about the video files, menus, subtitles, and any special features that the DVD may have. This is the file that tells the DVD player what to display when the menu appears, the start of different chapters in the DVD, and the location and time of the video and audio files on the DVD. VLAN VLC Player can open IFO files.\n\nIFO files are saved with .ifo extension.",
      "An IFO file is a DVD-Video disc information file used by DVD players. It contains information referenced by the DVD player which allows users to navigate and play the contents of the DVD. IFO files work in conjunction with .VOB and .VRO files, which contain the actual audio and video data."
