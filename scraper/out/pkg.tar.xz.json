      "Arch Linux is a Linux variant that was released in 2002. It includes a default package manager, named pacman, that users can use to create, install, and otherwise manage software packages. Prior to late December 2019, these packages were saved as PKG.TAR.XZ files. (They are now saved as PKG.TAR.ZST files.)",
      "Each PKG.TAR.XZ file consists of a software package stored in a .TAR archive that has been compressed using .XZ compression. Compressing the package makes it easier to distribute via the Internet and other file-sharing methods.",
