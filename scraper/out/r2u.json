      "Ransomware is a form of malware that renames and encrypts a user's files so they cannot open them. After encrypting a user's files, ransomware programs produce a ransom note that instructs users on how they can (supposedly) pay a ransom to restore their files.",
      "R2U ransomware encrypts a user's files and renames them to use the .r2u extension, producing filenames that end in extensions like .jpg.r2u. It then produces a ransom note named readme.txt.",
      "Ransomware is most commonly distributed in email attachments and programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and opened an unverified attachment or program, that may be how your computer became infected by R2U ransomware."
