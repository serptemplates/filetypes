      "The Nintendo DSi was the successor to the Nintendo DS and the predecessor to the Nintendo 3DS. The DSi and the 3DS allowed gamers to download a collection of games, commonly referred to as DSiWare, from the Nintendo DSi Shop and eShop. DSiWare games were saved in DSI files.",
      "In addition to allowing players to play downloaded games on their Nintendo devices, DSI files can be used to create unofficial ROMs that PC-based DSi and 3DS emulators, such as Citra, can open. To create an emulator-compatible ROM from a DSI file, gamers can use GodMode9 (Nintendo 3DS) or GodMode9i (Nintendo DSi).",
