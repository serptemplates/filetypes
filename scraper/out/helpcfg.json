      "Adobe Creative Suite 5 (CS5) included a feature called the Adobe Community Help Client (CHC). This application was linked to Adobe's community help websites and used its connection to those websites to show online help content to users. For example, when users selected Help in Adobe Acrobat X's menu, Acrobat X used the Community Help Client to find and show online help content. Subsequent versions of Adobe's Creative Suite and Creative Cloud applications included similar online help clients, named the Adobe Help Manager and Adobe Help Center.",
      "HELPCFG files are configuration files that Adobe CHC and other Adobe help clients use to retrieve help content for Adobe applications. For example, PremierePro_14.0.helpcfg contains the information, including product ID, base URL, and help service URL, used to retrieve and show online help content for Adobe Premiere Pro 14.",
      "At certain intervals, Adobe's help clients retrieve updated HELPCFG files from Adobe's servers. These files may contain updated paths to online help content. In the past, advanced Adobe users could use Adobe's help clients and their HELPCFG files to download online help content for use offline. As an example, you can find instructions for downloading and storing CS5 help documents offline at this link."
