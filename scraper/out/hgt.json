      "Some data in the original SRTM dataset is missing due to limits of the space missions. These areas are referred to as \"voids.\" Efforts have been made to fill in the missing gaps using interpolation methods. For example, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) created the \"Version 2\" and \"Version 2.1\" datasets, which include modified data. Therefore, some downloaded HGT files may include interpolated data.",
