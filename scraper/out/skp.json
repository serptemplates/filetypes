      "Trimble SketchUp is a 3D modeling program used in architecture, interior design, urban planning, film, video game design, and mechanical engineering industries. While Trimble now owns SketchUp, Google and @Last Software previously developed it. @Last Software released all versions of SketchUp up to version 5, and Google released version 6.",
      "The SKP format is the default format SketchUp uses to save complete 3D models, such as building designs or video game characters. However, SKP files may also contain SketchUp components, such as a door, window, or beam, instead of a complete building. Storing these components in SKP files allows designers to import and reuse them in multiple designs easily.",
      "NOTE: The Windows version of SketchUp automatically creates backups of users' SKP files (.SKB files). If you delete an SKP file or it becomes corrupted, you can restore the file using its SKB equivalent. The macOS version of SketchUp automatically saves SKP backups with the filename filename~.skp."

      "An SKP file is a proprietary three-dimensional model file created with the 3D design program SketchUp. It can comprise of several different 3D elements or components such as shades, wireframes, and textures. An SKP file can contain the entire architecture or may consist of smaller designs (such as door or a chair) of a larger design. This lets the models defined in such files to be reusable by inserting into other SketchUp documents.\n\nSKP files can be identified by their extension i.e. .skp that can easily be searched and found on a system by using the Operating System’s search feature.",
      "An SKP file is a three-dimensional (3D) model created by SketchUp, an easy-to-use 3D design program. It contains a model comprising wireframes, shades, edge effects, and textures. SKP files may also include components users can insert into other SketchUp documents."
