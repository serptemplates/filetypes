      "The Bink Video 2 format was released in 2013, replacing the original Bink (.BIK) format. The format provides considerably better performance than Bink while maintaining high video quality. BK2 files function as containers for data compressed with the Bink Video 2 and audio codecs. The compressed data may also be contained in .BIK2 files.",
