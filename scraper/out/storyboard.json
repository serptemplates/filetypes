      "STORYBOARD files are meant to be opened in Apple Xcode (Mac), as part of an Xcode project (.XCODEPROJ file). In Xcode, you can view a STORYBOARD file's contents as a visual storyboard or as XML. To change your view of the file's contents, right-click the file and select Open As → Xcode Storyboard or Open As → Source Code. (If your STORYBOARD file's contents always appear as source code, you need to Hide Code Review.)",
      "You can also view a STORYBOARD file's contents in the Mac version of Microsoft Visual Studio. After opening the project that contains your STORYBOARD file, right-click the file and select Open With → Xcode Interface Builder.",
      "Finally, you can view the XML a STORYBOARD file contains in Microsoft Visual Studio Code (multiplatform), GitHub Atom (multiplatform), or any other text or source code editor."
