      "Caesium is a free tool that allows users to compress, resize, and convert images. To import images into Caesium, users select File → Add Pictures... or File → Open Folder... and then select the images they want to import. The imported images then appear in Caesium's file list.",

If you have already compressed or resized an image included in your file list, your CLF file will also contain information about the compressed or resized version of your image, such as its new file size and resolution."
