      "FolderShare was acquired by Microsoft in 2005. It allowed users to access information across various devices. By double-clicking a P2P file within FolderShare, a file on a different device would be downloaded to your computer. FolderShare was replaced by Windows Live Sync.",
      "NOTE: The term \"P2P\" is also short for \"peer-to-peer,\" which refers to Internet file sharing programs. Most P2P programs do not use the \".p2p\" file extension."

      "A P2P file contains a shortcut to a file and is used by FolderShare, a Windows Live computer synchronizing service. It stores a reference to a specific file and is used in place of the actual file. P2P files are most often seen when On Demand Sync is active."
