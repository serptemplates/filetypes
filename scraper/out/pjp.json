      "You can convert the PJP image to a .JPG image by simply renaming the .pjp file extension to .jpg then opening it with a program that supports JPG images, such as Microsoft Photos in Windows or Apple Preview in macOS. You can view the image then export it to a different image type, such as .PNG or .BMP."

      "A PJP file is a bitmap image created in the Progressive JPEG format (PJPEG). It contains encoded bitmap data so that the downloaded image appears progressively from a blurry picture to the final sharp image. This enables image previews to be viewed before the entire image is downloaded."
