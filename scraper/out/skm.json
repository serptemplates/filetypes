      "An SKM file contains material information used by Trimble SketchUp, a 3D modeling application. It is a Zip-compressed package that stores .XML texture property files and typically includes a thumbnail .PNG image and .JPG texture image. SketchUp users utilize materials saved in SKM files to layer 2D graphics on 3D models."

      "You can only open SKM files with Trimble SketchUp. To add an SKM file to use the material it stores, place the SKM file in the application's \"Materials\" folder. You will then be able to access it in the Materials window in SketchUp.",
      "Since SKM files are Zip-compressed packages, you can also open them with an archive utility, such as Windows File Explorer or Apple Archive Utility. You may need to rename the .skm file extension to .zip for the compression utility to recognize it. After you extract its contents, you can view the XML, PNG, and JPG files that comprise the material."
