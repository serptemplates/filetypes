      "The WOFF 2.0 format is similar to the WOFF 1.0 format but features improved compression in order to decrease network bandwidth use. The format is based on the Brotli compression algorithm, which is an open source data compression library used to increase the speed of web browsing. WOFF2 files are roughly 30% smaller than .WOFF files.",
      "WOFF2 files allow web developers to use custom fonts rather than the standard web fonts. Many browsers support the WOFF format, including Chrome (beginning in version 36), Edge (beginning in version 14), Firefox (beginning in version 35), Safari (beginning in version 10), and Opera (beginning in version 26).",

      "WOFF2 is a font file format that is a more compressed version of the Web Open Font Format (WOFF). It was developed as a way to reduce the file size of web fonts, allowing them to load faster and use less bandwidth. WOFF2 uses a compression algorithm called Brotli to compress the font data, which can result in file sizes that are significantly smaller than equivalent WOFF fonts. This format is supported by most modern web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Edge (version 14 onwards).",
      "A WOFF2 file is a web font file created in the WOFF (Web Open Font Format) 2.0 format, an open format used to deliver webpage fonts on the fly. It is saved as a compressed container that supports TrueType (.TTF) and OpenType (.OTF) fonts. WOFF2 files also support font licensing metadata."
