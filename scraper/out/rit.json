      "SecurITree is a multiplatform program that allows security professionals to diagram attack trees, which are branching sequences of events by which an attacker might achieve a specified negative goal. For example, a security professional might create an attack tree that specifies multiple methods by which an attacker could compromise a nuclear power plant.",
      "Each SecurITree attack tree contains a set of shapes connected by lines. The shapes contain text that details the steps in an attacker's assault. When a user saves a SecuriTree attack tree, it is saved as an RIT file.",

The top node of an RIT file describes an attacker's overall goal, while the other nodes describe one or more series of events that allow the attacker to achieve that goal."
