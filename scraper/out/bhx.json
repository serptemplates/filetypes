      "BinHex was an encoding system and app available for Classic Mac OS. It allowed users to convert binary files into hexadecimal or plain text files, from which the original binary file could be reconstructed.",

      "A BHX file contains a plain text or hexadecimal representation of a binary file, created by the BinHex encoding system. BHX files were most often used to transfer binary files (such as images, multimedia, and documents) as text-based email attachments. You can extract the binary file a BHX file describes with Apple Archive Utility or ESTsoft ALZip."
