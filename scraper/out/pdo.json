      "Pepakura Designer allows papercraft enthusiasts to \"unfold\" digital 3D models into 2D papercraft designs. Users can then print the 2D papercraft design, cut out its pieces, and assemble them to recreate the 3D model in real life. Each 2D design contains folding lines, cut marks, and other instructions used to recreate the model.",
      "Users can import many different types of 3D models into Pepakura Designer, including .DXF, .OBJ, .3DS, .LWO, .STL, .KML, and .KMZ files. After the user imports their 3D model, Pepakura Designer unfolds the model and saves its 2D version as a PDO file. Users can click any of their PDO file's 2D parts to see which part of the 3D model that part corresponds to.",
      "NOTE: In addition to being able to view PDO files in Pepakura Designer, users can view PDO files in Pepakura Viewer, a free PDO-viewing software that is bundled with Pepakura Designer."

      "A PDO file is a papercraft file created by Pepakura Designer, a program used to turn digital 3D models into physical papercraft models. It contains a 3D model and its corresponding 2D papercraft cutouts. The 2D cutouts that PDO files contain are meant to be printed, so a papercraft enthusiast can assemble the cutouts into a replica of the 3D model."
