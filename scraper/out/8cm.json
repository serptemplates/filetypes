      "The 8CM format is an improvement on the .MOD and .6CM formats, which support up to four and six channels, respectively. The eight channels in an 8CM file enable creators to layer multiple instruments, sound effects, or voices independently, giving them more control over the mix."

      "An 8CM file is a module created by Triton Fasttracker that contains multiple audio tracks with eight channels. It is saved in the proprietary Eight Channel Module (8CM) format, allowing users to compose music or sound effects with eight separate audio channels. Throughout the 1990s, musicians and game developers often used Fasttracker to produce electronic music and game audio."
