      "Andrey Isaev developed Tonfotos to simplify the browsing of extensive collections of photos by making them more searchable based on when and where they were taken, the people appearing in the photos, and other types of unique information. When you tag people in photos, Tonfotos creates a TNFP file to store the information you add about the people.",
      "To tag people in photos, thus storing the information in the TNFP file, open the information panel, click the face of a person, and select This is ... → New person. Tonfotos then creates a new person in the \"People\" section of the app and stores the information in the TNFP file.",
      "NOTE: For Tonfotos to create a TNFP file to store people's information, you need to enable the app by selecting File → Library Locations..., choose the location, then check the \"Store dossier of people\" to the on position. Tonfotos saves the TNFP file next to the photos in the root folder of the photo archive."

It stores information about people tagged in photos, including their names, relations to other people, comments, and their main avatar. Tonfotos references the information in TNFP files to organize and display photos that include the tagged people."
