      "A QPR file is a query program source code file automatically generated by Microsoft Visual FoxPro when a user defines and runs queries. It contains plain text instructions, similar to a Visual FoxPro .PRG file, for executing database queries that retrieve or manipulate data within a Visual FoxPro database. QPR files allow developers to customize queries without manually writing all the necessary code and reuse or modify them for future queries."
