      "In March 2022, some PC users reported their computers' had been infected by VTYM ransomware. This malware encrypts users' files, including documents and images, and appends them with the .vtym extension. It then produces a ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. The ransom note contains instructions users can supposedly follow to decrypt their files.",
      "Ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by VTYM ransomware."

      "A file with the .vtym extension has been renamed and encrypted by VTYM ransomware. The .vtym extension is added to the file's original extension, producing an extension like .jpg.vtym. There is currently no way to decrypt and open VTYM-encrypted files."

      "VTYM files are encrypted, and they cannot be decrypted or opened. The best option to restore VTYM-encrypted files is likely to perform a System Restore. Performing a System Restore will cause you to lose any data created in the interval between now and your last restore point. Therefore, you may want to back up any data and files created since your last restore point."
