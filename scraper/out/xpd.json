      "An XPD file is a webpage file created from an XML document. More often, this is generated through an XSLT transformation. The XPD file format specifications are available on W3 that define a way to increase interoperability of multi-process XML applications. The XML Pipeline Language defines the processing relationships between XML resources.",
