      "An XPD file is a webpage file created from an XML document. More often, this is generated through an XSLT transformation. The XPD file format specifications are available on W3 that define a way to increase interoperability of multi-process XML applications. The XML Pipeline Language defines the processing relationships between XML resources.",
      "An XPD file is a license file downloaded alongside Sony PlayStation Store content. It is used for Digital Rights Management (DRM) and is required to transfer games and other downloaded files to a PlayStation Portable (PSP)."
