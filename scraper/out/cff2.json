      "CFF2 file format is the version 2.0 of the CFF file format and allows efficient storage of glyph outlines and metadata similar to the CFF file format. CFF2 differs from CFF in that it is intended to be used in the context of an OpenType font as a ‘sfnt’ table with the tag CFF2. It can’t be used as a stand-alone program and depends on data in other OpenType tables."
