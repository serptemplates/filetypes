      "Indigo Renderer is a multiplatform 3D rendering application that allows professional artists to create photorealistic images. Artists may create architectural mockups, video game scenes, film special effects, and more. The software is available as a standalone application or as a plugin for other 3D CAD programs.",
      "You can create an IGM file with Indigo Renderer when saving a material. To create an IGM file with Indigo Renderer, select File → New Material, then choose File → Save Material or Save Material As.",
      "While many artists create IGM files from scratch. You can also download IGM files from Indigo Renderer's website for free. Additionally, if you want to share an IGM file, you can compress it in the .PIGM format, which reduces the size to make it easier to store or transfer."

      "An IGM file is a material created by Glare Technologies Indigo Renderer, an app for generating photorealistic 3D images. It stores the graphical properties of a material in the XML standard that gives the surface of a 3D object a realistic appearance, such as that of metal, wood, plastic, brick, or liquid. IGM files may be included as part of an Indigo Renderer scene (.IGS file)."
