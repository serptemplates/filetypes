      "Android Debug Bridge is a command-line tool that allows Android developers to communicate with Android devices from a PC. To use a device with ADB, developers must first enable USB debugging within the device's Developer options. (To access Developer options, select Settings → About phone and tap the phone's build number seven times. Developer options will then appear on the device's Settings screen.) Then, the developer must connect the device to a PC that has Android Studio installed, using either WiFi or a USB cable.",
      "When working with devices running Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) or higher, developers can use ADB to create a snapshot of the device's current state. These snapshots are saved as AB files.",
      "To use ADB to back up your Android device:",
      "Make sure USB debugging is enabled on your Android device.",
      "Connect your device to your PC.",
      "Open a terminal window and navigate to the directory in which ADB is located (usually android_sdk/​platform-tools).",
      "Execute the command adb backup -all.",

      "adb backup -apk -all",
      "After you execute this command, ADB will ask whether you want to encrypt your backup using a password. Enter a password if you so desire. Then, select Back up my data. After you do, ADB will create a backup.ab file in your current directory."
