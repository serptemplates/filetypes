      "WinAce enables you to split archives into smaller parts so they can be more easily transferred, whether it be over the Internet or on physical storage devices, such as CDs or flash drives. When splitting an archive, WinAce creates multiple files depending on the size of the archive and the split archive size specified by the user. The first split archive is saved with the .c01 file extension, the second is saved with the .c02 file extension, and so on."
