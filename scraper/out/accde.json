      "A file with .accde extension is a Microsoft Access 2007 file format for creating Execute Only database files to protect custom database code. It compiles all VBA code into executable only so that it cannot be viewed or edited. ACCDE file format is replacement fo MDE file format that was used by earlier versions of Microsoft Access. ACCDE are ACCDB files in executable only mode and more compact due to absence of any source code. The compact size of these files improves the memory usage as well as enhances the application performance. ACCDE files can be opened with Microsoft Access 365.",
      "Database file created by Microsoft Access, a desktop relational database program; saves a \"locked-down\" version of an .ACCDB file so that all Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) code is saved in a compiled format and is not viewable or editable; allows custom database code to be protected."
