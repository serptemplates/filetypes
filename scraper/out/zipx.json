      "The ZIPX format was introduced with WinZip 12.1 in May 2009 and includes metadata that indicates the file was created using an advanced compression method. This lets users know that the file must be decompressed with WinZip 12.1 or another compatible file compression utility, such as PeaZip or The Unarchiver.",
      "You may encounter ZIPX files in a variety of ways, such as when receiving compressed files via email or downloading compressed files from a website. You may also find ZIPX files when exploring backup files that have been compressed with ZIPX compression.",
      "You can create ZIPX archives with WinZip by selecting .zipx in the \"Create/Share\" ribbon, adding the file(s) you want to compress, then clicking the floppy disk \"Save\" icon or selecting File → Save."

      "A ZIPX file is an extended version of the standard ZIP file that has been compressed using an advanced version of compression. This advanced compression method is developed by CorelWinZip that compresses all the files using the extended ZIPX format. ZIPX files are smaller in size than ZIP file format and makes data transfer over the internet more efficient. ZIPX files require WinZip to be installed on the system in order to open them.",
      "A ZIPX file is a .ZIP archive that has been compressed with an advanced compression method developed by CorelWinZip. It contains one or more files compressed in the extended Zip format (Zipx), which creates smaller files than previous versions of the Zip format."
