      "MCADDON files are created manually by users that want to distribute multiple MCPACK or MCWORLD files online. In order to create a MCADDON file, compress your MCPACK or MCWORLD files as a .ZIP file then rename the extension from \".zip\" to \".mcaddon\".",
      "Since MCADDON files are compressed with Zip compression, they can be expanded using a Zip decompression utility. Simply rename the \".mcaddon\" extension to \".zip\" and use a zip decompression program to expand the contents. Some Zip programs include Corel WinZip, 7-Zip, Apple Archive Utility, or ES File Explorer."
