      "Apple introduced the M4R format in 2007 to store audio played back by an iPhone during an incoming call. While users primarily downloaded and transferred M4R files with iTunes before Apple discontinued it, they could also manually transfer M4R files on their computer to their connected iPhone with a third-party file manager. After transferring an M4R file to their phone, they can set it as the ringtone on their iPhone by selecting Settings → Sounds & Haptics → Ringtone.",
      "Additionally, users could create M4R files with iTunes, but they also may create them with third-party software programs or download them from the Internet. M4R files not created with iTunes most likely do not include copyright protection.",
      "NOTE: M4R stands for \"MPEG-4 Ringtone.\""

      "Unlock the secret to custom iPhone sounds with the M4R file format, a specialized audio type dedicated exclusively to iOS ringtones. At its core, an M4R file is a standard MPEG-4 AAC audio file, but its unique .m4r extension acts as a direct signal to Apple’s ecosystem, designating it as a ringtone rather than a standard song. You can craft these custom ringtones using a variety of audio editing and conversion software. Once created, the primary method for transferring them to your device is through synchronization via iTunes or Finder. While the M4R format was engineered specifically for the iPhone, its underlying AAC audio content means it can be played back on any media player or device that supports the versatile AAC format, offering a degree of flexibility beyond the Apple ecosystem.",
      "An M4R file is a custom iPhone ringtone that plays back during an incoming call. It is similar to an .M4A file as it stores audio data encoded with the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) codec in the MPEG-4 Part 14 (MP4) multimedia container format. Before Apple discontinued iTunes, iPhone users often downloaded M4R files from the media player and then transferred them to an iPhone when the phone was synced with the computer via iTunes."
