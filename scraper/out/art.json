      "An ART file is a compressed bitmap image file created and used by America Online (AOL) service and client software. It was built to reduce the image size for quick downloading over the internet. The compression algorithm applied on image to generate .art files is similar to the JPEG format, but at times reduces the image quality while favouring the reduction of file size. ART files can be opened using the AOL File Viewer.",
      "CAD model created by ArtCAM, a CNC (computer numerical control) program used for artistic design and manufacturing; saves a 2D or 3D model as well as instructions for a machine to cut or engrave the design; used for signs, woodworking, engraving, and jewelry."
