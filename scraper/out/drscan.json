      "A DRSCAN file contains scans created by Data Rescue, a program used for recovering files from crashed or infected hard drives. It saves the result of one or more drive scans, which detect the existing directory structure and locate files. DRSCAN files can be imported back into Data Rescue but only if the Mac OS X system specifications match those when the scan was performed."
