      "Scarlet is an unofficial, third-party alternative to the iOS App Store. In addition to allowing a user to download and install iOS applications, by sideloading their IPA files, Scarlet includes many advanced features. One of these features is the ability to back up apps and their related data in SCRIPA files.",
      "For example, if a user has modified an app's settings, they might want to back up that app as a SCRIPA file. Doing so creates a copy of the app that retains their settings data, which the user can quickly reinstall and resume using (with their settings already in place) if needed.",
