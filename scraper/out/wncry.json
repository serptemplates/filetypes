      "Wana Decrypt0r 2.0 is an updated version of WannaCry (WCry) ransomware. This virus encrypts your files and appends the .wncry extension to them, producing files that look something like filename.docx.wncry. The encryption prevents you from opening the files.",
      "The virus then produces a .TXT ransom note explaining what has happened to your files, as well as how you can pay a ransom to decrypt them. (FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files.)",
      "Wana Decrypt0r 2.0 is primarily spread via emails designed to trick a victim into opening a malicious email attachment. The virus is also sometimes spread through fake system updates and torrent websites."

      "A WNCRY file is a file encrypted by Wana Decrypt0r 2.0, which is ransomware utilized by cybercriminals. It contains a user's file, such as a .BAT, .BMP, .WAV, or .XLSX file, encrypted with the RSA algorithm and AES-128 ciphers. WNCRY files became prevalent in 2017."

The best way to restore your WNCRY files is to perform a system restore on your PC or load uninfected versions of your files from a backup. If you cannot restore your files using a system restore or backup, you may want to try the WNCRY decryption tools linked below."
