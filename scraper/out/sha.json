      "GodMode9 allows users to back up the data stored on their Nintendo 3DS's internal storage system, which is commonly referred to as SysNAND. When a user backs up their data, GodMode9 creates a .BIN file that contains the backed-up data and an SHA file that contains a checksum. Before the user stores their BIN file or uses the file to restore their data, they can use the SHA file to verify the BIN file's integrity.",
      "For example, a user can:",
      "Create an SHA file for their SysNAND contents before backing up their data.",
      "Back up their data and produce a second SHA file.",
      "Compare the two files' values to ensure their data was backed up correctly."
