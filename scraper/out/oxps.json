      "The OpenXPS format is based on the XML Paper Specification (XPS) format, which Microsoft developed to replace the Enhanced Metafile (.EMF) format. However, OpenXPS is an open format standardized in June 2009 by Ecma International, a standards organization for communication and information systems.",
      "NOTE: While the OpenXPS format is based on the XPS format, the two formats are not interchangeable. You cannot simply change the .oxps extension of an OXPS file to .xps in order to make it an .XPS file."

      "The file format OXPS is known as Open XML Paper Specification. It’s a page description language and document format. Microsoft is the developer of this format. OXPS file format is very much familiar to these PDF files. The setup of the OXPS file is the same as an XPS format. The only difference is the description of OXPS as an open format. The .oxps file extension is the most current version of the XPS file format originated by Microsoft and Ecma International. If we talk about the specification, the OXPS and XPS files are used to publish, share, and allocate fixed-layout documents. As a substitute to PDFs, the OXPS file format can store text and multimedia data, with arranging features and printing layout characteristics.",
      "An OXPS file is a document saved in the Open XML Paper Specification (OpenXPS) format. It stores information that describes the structure and content of the document and preserves it as a fixed layout similar to .PDF documents. Users typically create OXPS files to save essays, letters, postcards, newsletters, and business documents."
