      "WinHKI is an obscure archiving utility that was available for Windows. It allows users to compress and archive files in one of three different formats: HKI1, HKI2, and HKI3. Each format is optimized for use with different types of files.",
      "HKI3 is WinHKI's catch-all format. Thus, unlike HKI1 and HKI2 files, HKI3 files are not likely to contain any particular types of files. (HKI1 files typically contain MP3 files or CD images, and HKI2 files typically contain programs or documents.)"

      "An HKI3 file is an archive created by WinHKI, an archive utility developed by Hanspeter Karl Imp. It contains one or more files that have been compressed and packaged together, to reduce their file size and make them easier to store and share. HKI3 files are similar to but compressed differently than .HKI1 and .HKI2 files."
