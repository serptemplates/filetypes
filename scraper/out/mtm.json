      "The MTM file extension, an acronym for MultiTracker Module, represents a specialized audio file format historically used for dynamic music playback in video games and multimedia applications. Functioning as a container, a single MTM file bundles a collection of individual music tracks or patterns that can be triggered independently or seamlessly combined to form a complete, interactive composition. This structure was ideal for creating adaptive soundtracks that could respond to in-game events. As part of the broader tracker module family, it shares a foundational philosophy with renowned formats like MOD and S3M, yet it is distinguished by its unique technical approach to data storage, channel allocation, and playback sequencing.\n\nMTM files were popular in the 1990s and early 2000s, particularly in the demoscene and video game music communities. Today, they are less commonly used, but there are still some multimedia and gaming applications that support the format. To play an MTM file, you will need a media player or software that supports the format, such as Winamp or ModPlug Player.",
      "Universal audio tracker module format that is similar to a .MOD file; contains sound samples and a musical score for playback; supports up to 32 channels, which allows many samples to be played back at once."
