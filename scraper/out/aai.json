      "Dune HD specializes in media players for organizing, playing, and streaming media to televisions. Models include BOXY, Ultra Vision 4K, and Magic 4K Plus.",
      "Typically, the Dune HD media players organize AAI images into folders based on the content for which they are designed. For example, information for an Internet radio station may be saved in the \"Station1\" folder, which includes a .TXT file describing the visualization parameters and the AAI image for the station's icon (likely named icon.aai).",

      "An AAI file is a raster image used by Dune HD media players to display images with transparency, such as icons for Internet radio stations or channels. It stores 32-bit RGBA image data, which is based on the RGB model and includes an alpha channel for transparency. Users will likely only encounter AAI files if they are attempting to modify graphics in a Dune HD media player."
