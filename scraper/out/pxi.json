      "PXI files are similar to how the #include directive works in the C programming language. Additionally, PXI files are different from .PXD files, which are definition files that declare classes, functions, or variables for use in other Pyrex (or Cython) modules. While PXD files serve a similar purpose to .C header files, PXI files are more like inline text includes that are copied directly into a file at compile time.",
      "NOTE: Pyrex is less commonly used today (not actively developed) but served as the basis for Cython, a more modern and widely adopted tool for writing Python-compatible C extensions."

Developers primarily use PXI files to store chunks of code to be inserted into a .PYX file, allowing them to reuse code or break large modules into smaller, more manageable parts."
