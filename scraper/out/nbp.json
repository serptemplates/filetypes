      "An NBP file is a published notebook (.NB) created by Wolfram Research Mathematica to store analysis results as an interactive document. It stores all of the elements that comprise a notebook, such as text, graphics, sound, calculations, diagrams, and user interface components. Mathematica no longer develops the NBP format; users publish notebooks in the NB format."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open NBP files with Wolfram Research Mathematica. To open an NBP file, select File → Open. Wolfram Research Player is a free app that can also open NBP files.",
      "Since NBP files store plain text, you can view them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad in Windows, Apple TextEdit in macOS, or gedit in Linux. However, opening NB files with a text editor will not display them the same as Mathematica or Wolfram Player, which displays them natively."
