      "An ASTRO file contains a component of a website built with the Astro JavaScript web framework. It stores a mixture of HTML, JavaScript, and code in the Astro-specific syntax that makes up a component, such as a header, button, or profile card. Astro users typically use ASTRO files to organize components when building a website and can open and edit them with a source code or plain text editor."

Some source code editor options include Microsoft Visual Studio Code (multiplatform), Sublime Text (multiplatform), and Brackets (Windows and macOS). These editors are helpful because they provide features, such as syntax highlighting.",
      "Plain text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (macOS), can also open ASTRO files. However, these options don't provide the same helpful viewing and editing capabilities as source code editors."
