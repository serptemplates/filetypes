      "Most MathType users will not encounter EQL files since they are stored in the application's installation directory, and the program references them. However, some users may discover them when migrating preferences between MathType installations.",
      "NOTE: EQL files' filenames relate to the object for which they store settings (e.g., Toolbar.eql defines the layout and functionality of MathType's toolbar). Also, if an EQL file becomes corrupt, users can delete it to restore the default setting since the software automatically regenerates the necessary configuration file."
