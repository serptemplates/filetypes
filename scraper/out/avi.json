      "The AVI format is based on the Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF), a container format initially released in 1991 to store multimedia. MICROSOFT INTRODUCED the AVI format a year later in 1992 and is still commonly used today.",
      "The AVI video format can store high-quality video and audio and typically uses less compression than other similar video formats such as .MPEG and .MOV. While this means the video quality will be high, it results in large AVI file sizes, which can be problematic for users with limited space."

      "The AVI file format is an Audio Video multimedia container file format that was introduced by Microsoft. It holds the audio and video data created and compressed using several codecs (Coders/Decoders) such as XVid and DivX. Since different codecs can be used to encode the AVI contents, the retrieving applications i.e. AVI players, should be able to open these only if they have the required codecs installed with which the AVI contents were created. The format is supported by default on all Microsoft Windows platforms as well as on almost all other major platforms. Several applications and APIs provide the capability to create/save, read and convert AVI to other popular formats such as MP4, MOV, WMV, etc.",
      "An AVI file is a video file saved in the Audio Video Interleave (AVI) multimedia container format created by Microsoft. It stores video and audio data encoded in various codecs, including DivX and XviD."
