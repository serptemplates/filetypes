      "The GYM name comes from Genesis YM2612, which is the console's sound chip. By using the Genecyst emulator, users could log the audio data stream sent to the YN2612 sound chip into the GYM file. They could then play the GYM file back with an audio player to listen to the music. However, the .VGM format was later introduced as an improved version of the GYM format and replaced it.",
