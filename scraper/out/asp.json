      "ASP files are similar to .HTML files but are used a little differently. When a web browser requests an HTML file, the server just sends the file. However, when a web browser requests an ASP file, the server sends the request through the ASP engine, which parses the ASP file and generates plain HTML that is sent to the client's browser. Since ASP pages are processed on the server, website visitors do not see the actual ASP code, just the HTML generated from the scripts within the page. ASP pages typically use the .asp extension rather than .html.",
      "Since the release of ASP 1.0 in 1996, there have only been two other versions, ASP 2.0 in 1997 and ASP 3.0 in 2000. In 2002, Microsoft released ASP.NET, which superseded ASP. Now ASP is commonly referred to as Classic ASP or ASP Classic. Because of the wide implementation of the ASP.NET framework, ASP pages have largely been replaced by .ASPX pages. Some advantages of ASP.NET over ASP is the use of more languages such as C#, VB.NET, J#, and Delphi.NET, as well as improved performance with compiled code, more advanced debugging, and better run-time error handling."

      "ASP stands for Active Server Pages which is a development framework for creating web pages. It enables computer code to be executed by an internal server to serve the web requests. When a request is generated for an ASP file by web browser, the server reads the the file and executes any code/script inside it to generate the HTML result which is returned to the browser for display.\n\nUnlike HTML pages, which are static pages served by the server, ASP files generate dynamic contents at runtime that may involve requests to data from a database. ASP pages typically use the .asp extension rather than .html. Since code/script inside an ASP file is executed on the server side, requesting browser can’t see the code used to build the served page. All modern browsers are capable of displaying pages generated as result. Being built on Microsoft technology, pages built with ASP are hosted on Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS) servers.",
      "An ASP file is a webpage created by a web developer that resides on a web server and may contain scripts written in VBScript or JavaScript. It is parsed on the server, which generates HTML that is sent to the client's browser. ASP files are commonly used by ASP.NET sites and websites hosted on Windows servers running Microsoft IIS."
