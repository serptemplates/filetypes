      "A SIT file is a compressed archive file created with Micro StuffIt software. This is the original standard file format that was introduced by StuffIt. SIT file format is commonly used on Macintosh systems, but now it is supported on both Windows and Macintosh platforms. StuffIt extended the SIT file format to SITX which offers more compression as compared to SIT files. SIT files can be opened with Smith Micro StuffIt Deluxe Mac 16 software.",
      "Compressed file \"stuffed\" by Smith Micro StuffIt software; common file compression format used on Macintosh systems; originally Mac-only, now cross-platform, meaning SIT files can be created and opened on both Macintosh and Windows platforms."

      "MAC OS includes built-in support for extracting SIT files, and you don’t necessarily need additional software. Find the .sit file that you want to extract on your Mac. In most cases, you can simply double-click on the .sit file. macOS should recognize the StuffIt format and automatically use the built-in Archive Utility to extract the contents. The extracted files and folders will be placed in the same directory as the original .sit file."
