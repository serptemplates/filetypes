      "An ECE file is a dynamically generated web page by the content management platform, Escenic Content Engine (ECE). It contains server-side code that is processed by the web server and served back to the user browser as HTML page. ECE file format is not very commonly popular as compared to other server side file formats such as ASP and PHP. These files are rendered internally and served to end users for display purpose.",
