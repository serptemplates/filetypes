      "A STEX file contains a texture created by version 3 of Godot Engine, a free and open-source game engine used to create 2D and 3D games. It stores an image in StreamTexture format, which is applied to an object in the game to give it texture. Godot replaced the STEX format with the .CTEX format when it released version 4 of Godot Engine."
