      "A file with .sdf extension contains the Microsoft SQL Server Compact (SQL CE) database which is also known as a compact relational database; produced by Microsoft for the applications made for mobile devices and desktops. It supports both 32 and 64 bits operating system and the complete content of database is included in a single SDF file and can occupy more than 4GB disk space. For the security purpose, a .sdf file can be encrypted with 128-bit encryption. The SQL CE runtime settles parallel multi-user access to the .sdf file. The SDF file can be copied via QuickOnce or simply it can be copied to destination for system deployment.",
      "An SDF file contains a compact relational database saved in the SQL Server Compact (SQL CE) format, which is developed by Microsoft. It is designed for applications that run on mobile devices and desktops and contains the complete database contents, which may be up to 4GB in size."
