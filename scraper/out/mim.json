      "A MIM file is an encoded file used by email programs that contain 8-bit data or other characters besides the US ASCII character set. It supports 8-bit content, such as file attachments, instead of standard 7-bit messages typically sent over email. MIM files also include metadata, such as the MIME version, content type, and encoding method."
