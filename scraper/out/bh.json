      "Carl Bunton developed the BH algorithm in the 1990s and made it available with ZipTV, a suite of compression components for app developers to help them securely archive and store backups. BH shares similarities with Zip compression and supports encryption.",

Additionally, non-developers may compress their files as BH archives even though it was originally intended for app developers. To create a BH archive with PowerArchiver:",
