      "A file with .dz extension is a compressed archive created with the command line utility Dzip. It offers a higher compression ratio than other compression file formats. Dzip can also decompress compressed files and extraction of files is more quicker. Dzip comes with full integration for Windows shell to accept dragged files with the feature to avoid duplication of files when dragged to archive. Like RAR files, Dzip is able to create self-extracting executable files from its .dz files. The comparatively small size of Dzip utility (130k) makes it possible to carry this utility on disc.",
      "Compressed file created by Dzip, a command line utility used for compressing and decompressing files; saves the archive in a proprietary format that sometimes can be created and extracted more quickly and with a higher compression ratio than other compression methods."
