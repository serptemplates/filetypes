      "A PAN file, in the context of Panorama, refers to a database file created by Panorama database software. Panorama is a database management system developed by ProVUE Development for macOS.\n\nThe PAN file extension is used to represent a Panorama database file, which stores structured data in a tabular format. These files can contain tables, records, fields, and data entries. Panorama provides tools for managing and manipulating data within these databases.\n\nIf you have a PAN file, you can use Panorama software to open and work with the database, perform queries, create reports, and perform various data operations.",
      "The PAN file format used by Panorama database software is a proprietary format developed by ProVUE Development. The specific technical details of the format are not publicly disclosed, as the format is specific to Panorama and its associated software.\n\nHowever, PAN files are binary files that store structured data in a proprietary manner. They include information about tables, fields, records, indexes, and other database components, allowing Panorama software to read and manipulate the data efficiently.",
      "Database file created by Panorama, a data manipulation application; saves data in a structured proprietary format and can be viewed in the form of a spreadsheet in the software; can be filtered, sorted, searched, and saved using the software's highly efficient algorithms."
