      "Bass guitar tablature is a musical notation that instructs bass guitarists on how to play a piece of music. Besides bass guitar tablature, the ASCII tab format may also save guitar tablature in .TAB files. The main difference between the files is that BTAB files store notes for 4 strings instead of 6 strings.",
      "While the ASCII tab format stores tablature and lyrics, the format may also include symbols for instructing the playing of various techniques. Some symbol examples include the following:",
      "b - Bend string up",
      "r - Release bend",
      "v - Vibrato",
      "T - Tap",
      "t - Right hand tap",
      "S - Shift slide",
      "The ASCII tab format is human-readable but may also be saved inconsistently since many people create BTAB files by typing in tablature in a simple .TXT file. They then change the .txt file extension to .btab."
