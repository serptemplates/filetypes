      "DIF stands for data interchange format and is a standardized spreadsheet export format that is widely supported. The purpose of DIF files is to allow users to export data from a spreadsheet in a format that can be imported by a variety of programs.",
      "One limitation of the format is that it does not support multiple spreadsheets. This means that the DIF file can only store one spreadsheet. Therefore, if you need to export multiple spreadsheets in the DIF format you will need to create multiple DIF files."

      "A DIF file is a spreadsheet supported by spreadsheet software such as Microsoft Excel and Access and Apache OpenOffice Calc. It contains spreadsheet data exported from a program. DIF files are stored in ASCII text, which means they can be viewed and edited with a text editor."
