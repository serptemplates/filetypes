      "Engineers and product designers use SolidWorks to create 3D assemblies, which are representations of mechanical parts, tools, and other manufactured items. After creating an assembly, users can translate it (or its components) into a 2D drawing.",
      "When a user creates a drawing, they are asked to choose a drawing sheet format. This format determines the drawing's width and height, as well as what guidelines, logos, and notation the drawing includes. SolidWorks contains many default drawing sheet formats, most of which represent a standard format used in the engineering industry. These drawing sheet formats are saved as SLDDRT files."

      "An SLDDRT file is a drawing sheet created by Dassault Systemes SolidWorks, a popular CAD program. It contains dimensions used to load the sheet in SolidWorks, so a user can create an appropriately-sized drawing (.SLDDRW file). SLDDRT files may also contain logos, guidelines, and fields used to show drawing properties."
