      "An MP file is a project file created with the Personal Learning Edition (PLE) of 3D modelling program, Maya. It is supported by the PLE version of Maya only and is purely for non-commercial uses. For this purpose, Maya PLE edition includes a watermark on the exported file. Maya PLE provides limited functionality and can be installed on personal computers only. The MP file contains all the information about the project created with PLE and can be opened with Autodesk Maya PLE.\n\nMP files contain all the project data, including 3D models, textures, lighting, animations, and scripts. However, they are exclusive to Maya PLE and cannot be opened in the full commercial version of Maya.",
