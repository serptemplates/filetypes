      "A file with .s00 extension is the first part of a compressed file that is split using the ZipSplitter software. Splitting the files into such smaller files reduces the overall size of the compressed archive and makes it easy for transportation over the internet. Remaining parts of the split archive are named with extensions .S01, .S02 and so on. When the file is supposed to be extracted, the .EXE file included with the split file is double-click. The EXE looks for .S00 file and uses the other accompanied files for extraction of the whole archive.",
      "An S00 file is the first part of a file that was split using ZipSplitter, a program used to split files for easier transportation. It contains a segment of a larger file, such as a .WMV or .MP4 file, that is one part of several other parts. S00 files can be restored, along with the other parts (.S01, .S02, etc.) by double-clicking the .EXE file included with the split file."
