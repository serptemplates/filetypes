      "A MOD file pattern is actually designed in a sequencer user interface as a table with one column per channel, So this table has four columns (one for each Amiga hardware channel. Each column has 64 rows).\n\nA cell in the table can cause one of the following actions to happen on its column’s channel when its row’s time is reached:\n\nStart an instrument playing a new note in this channel at a given volume, possibly with a special effect applied on itChange the volume or special effect being applied to the current noteChange pattern flow; jump to a specific song or pattern position or loop inside a patternDo nothing; any existing note playing in this channel will continue to play\n\nAn instrument is a single sample along with an optional specification of which portion of the sample can be repeated to hold a solid note.",
      "Karsten Obarski initially developed the Amiga module format and released it with the Ultimate Soundtracker software for the Commodore Amiga system in 1987. As music trackers began supporting the format, especially on PCs in the 1990s, other developers released variations of the MOD format.",
      "Initially, the MOD format only supported four audio channels and sixteen instruments. However, recent MOD variations have increased the number of supported channels to 32 and supported instruments to 31.",
      "The sound samples within a module are assigned to different tracks and are played back according to the notes in the score. A MOD module also includes a list that tells the application playing the module the order the patterns are to be played.",
      "NOTE: MOD files may be created by various MOD trackers, including FastTracker, StarTrekker, Noise Tracker, MilkyTracker, and Cog."

      "The MOD file format, recognized by its .mod extension, is a landmark in digital audio history. It was originally developed as the Amiga module format by Karsten Obarski and launched with the revolutionary Ultimate Soundtracker software for the Commodore Amiga. Functioning as a music module file, it operates on a principle similar to a MIDI file but with a critical difference: it is a self-contained package that includes both the note patterns and the actual sound samples for each instrument. This means that every instrument, from drums to melodies, is played back precisely as the composer intended using the embedded samples. Due to its compact size and high-quality audio output, the MOD file became a staple for background music in video games and a foundational element within the creative, tech-driven demoscene computer art subculture.",
      "A MOD file is a music module file saved in the standard music module format, originating from the Amiga module format. It contains note patterns (similar to a .MIDI file) and sound samples representing different instruments played back according to the notes. MOD files are typically used for background music in video games and the \"demoscene\" computer art subculture."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open a MOD file with various audio players, such as Nullsoft Winamp (Windows), VideoLAN VLC media player (multiplatform), Schism Tracker (multiplatform), and MikMod (multiplatform). Unfortunately, some audio players that support MOD files may no longer be developed and not work on modern operating systems.",
      "On an Android device, you can play MOD files with Smarper Amiga Mod Player for Android, and on iOS devices, you can use PureModPlay or VividTracker to play MOD files."
