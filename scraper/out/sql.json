      "You will most likely only encounter SQL files if you develop or manage web databases. The SQL language first appeared in the 1970s at IBM and was adopted by the ANSI and ISO standard groups in 1986 as the standard language for relational database management systems (RDBMS). Since its adoption, it has gone through multiple revisions to support a wider set of features and has spawned several database language variations, which include Mini SQL (mSQL) and MySQL.",

      "A file with .sql extension is a Structured Query Language (SQL) file that contains code to work with relational databases. It is used to write SQL statements for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, and Delete) operations on databases. SQL files are common while working with desktop as well as web-based databases. There are several alternatives to SQL such as Java Persistence Query Language (JPQL), LINQ, HTSQL, 4D QL, and several others. SQL files can be opened by query editors of Microsoft SQL Server, MySQL and other plain text editors such as Notepad on Windows OS.",

      "SQL files can be read by any SQL-compatible database program, such as MySQL and Richardson RazorSQL. You can also open and edit SQL files in various source code editors, such as gVim, Bare Bones BBEdit, and MacroMates TextMate.",
      "If you do not have access to a SQL database program or a source code editor, you can open a SQL file in a plain text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad and Apple TextEdit. Note, however, that these plain text editors will not show the helpful styling and syntax that source code editors provide to help users make sense of SQL files."
