      "SQLite databases store data in tables, which may contain multiple fields of various data types such as text or integers. Developers can access and modify this data using SQL queries or \"CRUD\" (create, read, update, delete) operations. Since databases are self-contained, updates to the database are fully contained within the SQLITE file. However, SQLite may record transaction information in a second temporary file called a rollback journal.",
      "The SQLite library is freely available and is supported by all major mobile and desktop platforms including Android, iOS, Windows, and macOS. Additionally, all major programming languages provide support for SQLite.",
      "NOTE: The file extension \".sqlite\" is not always used for SQLite databases. Developers often use a different file extension such as \".dat\" or \".db\" to conceal the file format."

      "A file with .sqlite extension is a lightweight SQL database file created with the SQLite software. It is a database in a file itself and implements a self-contained, full-featured, highly-reliable SQL database engine. SQLite database files can be used to share rich contents between systems by simple exchanging these files over the network. Almost all mobiles and computers use SQLite for storing and sharing of data, and is the choice of file format for cross-platform applications. Due to its compact use and easy usability, it comes bundled inside other applications. SQLite bindings exist for programming languages such as C, C#, C++, Java, PHP, and many others.",
      "An SQLITE file contains a database created with SQLite, a lightweight Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) widely used in application development for storing embedded databases. SQLITE files are often created by software developers for storing data used by their applications."
