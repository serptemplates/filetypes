      "The DB.CRYPT12 file is a result of WhatsApp appending the .CRYPT12 file extension to the .DB file. It is used by WhatsApp to secure a user's message database on his or her Android device. For each new version of the application, WhatsApp uses a different algorithm to encrypt the DB files. The extension appended to the DB file, such as .CRYPT6, .CRYPT7, or .CRYPT8 signifies the algorithm used for encryption.",
      "The DB.CRYPT12 database files are located on the SD card of your Android device. The file is located in the following directory: /​sdcard/​WhatsApp/​Databases",
      "NOTE: WhatsApp Messenger creates DB.CRYPT12 files periodically to save incremental backups of databases. You can delete DB.CRYPT12 files to reclaim storage space but you will delete messages stored in the DB.CRYPT12 database."
