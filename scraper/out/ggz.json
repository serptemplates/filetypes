      "GGZ files are emulator-specific, meaning you can open a GGZ file only while using the emulator that created the file. The easiest way to open a GGZ file is to visit NeptunJS.xyz and navigate to the webpage used to play the video game from which your GGZ file was created. Begin playing the game, and then click the Load state button. Then, navigate to and open your GGZ file.",
      "GGZ files are .GZ archives that contain a save state file and a .PNG preview image. If you decompress your GGZ file, you can use the save state file it contains to resume your game in a supported emulator. For example, if your GGZ file contains an .N64 file, you can decompress the GGZ file and then open the N64 file in Nemu64, OpenEmu, or N64oid."
