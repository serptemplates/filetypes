      "JPEG 2000 was created in 2000 by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) committee to replace the JPEG format. The group also released a part 2 extension to the format that supports additional features, such as the composition of multiple code streams into one image and animations. Images saved in the part-2 extension to the format typically have the .jpx extension.",
      "JPX files typically contain digital photographs. However, they may also store other types of images, such as medical scans or satellite map images.",
      "NOTE: Most JPEG 2000 images are saved as .JP2 files, but they may also be saved as JPX and .JPF files."

      "A file with .jpx extension is an extension to the JPEG 2000 file format. It uses the JPEG 2000 compression primarily and also provides advanced features such as multiple layers for an image, various colour spaces, opacity, and fragmented code streams. JPX also allows other compressions such as JBIG, CCITT Group3, CCITT Group4, etc. in addition to the JPEG 2000 compression. The JPX file format was approved as ISO/IEC 15444-2 standard, but couldn’t receive a warm reception due to the extensive usage of JPEG file format. Applications that can open JPX files include Corel PaintShop Pro, Adobe Photoshop 2020, Adobe Illustrator 2020, and CorelDraw Graphics Suite 2020.",
      "A JPX file is an image saved in the part-2 extension to the JPEG 2000 format. It stores image data compressed with lossy or lossless compression and supports image transparency and retains alpha and spot channels. JPX files may also contain additional metadata that describes the contents of the file."
