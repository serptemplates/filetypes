      "Extensible Markup Language, or XML, is a markup language developers use to structure data. XML files contain datasets structured using XML.",
      "XML allows developers to structure data using custom tags. This flexibility makes XML ideal for cataloging information about nearly any set of related items. For example, a developer creating a catalog of automobiles may include the following entry in their XML file:",
      "<auto> <manufacturer>Tesla</manufacturer> <model>S</model> <horsepower>670 to 1,020</horsepower> <price>$69,420+</price> </auto>",
      "Because websites and applications can easily process XML, and humans can easily understand the data XML files contain, XML has become a standard way of transferring data over the Internet and between programs. XML is also used to structure the data contained within other types of files, such as Microsoft Office Open XML Documents (.DOCX, .PPTX, .XLSX), LibreOffice OpenDocuments (.ODT, .ODP, .ODS), .XHTML files, and .SVG files."

    "description": [
      "XML stands for Extensible Markup Language that is similar to HTML but different in using tags for defining objects. The whole idea behind creation of XML file format was to store and transport data without being dependent on software or hardware tools. Its popularity is due to it being both human as well as machine readable. This enables it to create common data protocols in the form of objects to be stored and shared over network such as World Wide Web (WWW). The “X” in XML is for extensible which implies that the language can be extended to any number of symbols as per user requirements. It is for these features that many standard file formats make use of it such as Microsoft Open XML, LibreOffice OpenDocument, XHTML and SVG.",
      "An XML file is an XML (Extensible Markup Language) data file. It contains a formatted dataset that is intended to be processed by a website, web application, or software program. XML files can be thought of as text-based databases."
