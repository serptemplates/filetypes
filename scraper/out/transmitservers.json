      "Panic Transmit allows users to conveniently log in to, retrieve files from, and transfer files between many different servers. Transmit keeps a record of all the servers a user is logged in to, as well as the user's server login credentials. The user's servers appear in Transmit's Servers menu.",
      "If a user wants to transfer their server list and login credentials to another instance of Transmit, they can do so by exporting that information as a TRANSMITSERVERS file. Then, when the user opens their new instance of Transmit, they can import the file to connect to their servers.",
      "NOTE: Panic began using the TRANSMITSERVERS file type in version 5. Previous versions of Transit stored exported server lists in .EXPORTEDFAVORITES or EXPORTEDSERVERS files."
