      "The AR format acts as a container for multiple game assets, allowing the developers to package and distribute large amounts of data efficiently. This structure also enables the game engine to quickly locate and load necessary files without needing individual access to each resource. Players and modders sometimes extract or modify AR files to access or customize game content."

      "An AR file is a game data archive used by Midtown Madness and Midtown Madness 2, racing games developed by Angel Studios and published by Microsoft. It contains game resources in a compressed format, including 3D models, textures, vehicle data, tracks, sounds, and menu elements. The game loads the resources in the AR file at runtime to render environments, display menus, and manage gameplay elements."

      "However, modders may use tools, such as deAR (for the original Midtown Madness) and deAR2 (for Midtown Madness 2), which can unpack the data stored inside these archives. Since AR files are stored in a structure similar to standard .ZIP compression, various ZIP-compatible utilities, such as 7-Zip and Corel WinZip can extract assets from AR files."
