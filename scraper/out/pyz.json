      "A PYZ file is an executable Python application stored in a compressed or uncompressed .ZIP archive. It contains a .PY script (likely named __main__.py) and may also include Python modules, libraries, and resource files. Users package and share Python applications as PYZ files to share with others who can securely run them across different platforms without installation."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open PYZ files with the Python interpreter (beginning with version 2.6) on any platform. For example, you can type the following in Python to run a Python application in a PYZ file: python filename.pyz. You can also run a PYZ file in Windows by double-clicking it.",
      "Since PYZ files are renamed ZIP files, you can open them with a standard compression utility, such as \"Windows File Explorer,\" Apple Archive Utility (macOS), Corel WinZip (Windows), or Corel WinZip Mac (macOS). You may need to rename the file extension from .pyz to .zip."
