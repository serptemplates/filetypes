      "GTK+ reads the IMMODULES file at runtime to determine which input method modules are available and how to initialize them. Each entry in the file typically includes the module’s path, supported locales, and other metadata required to load and use the module correctly. Without the IMMODULES file, certain language input features will not function correctly in GTK+-built applications.",
      "GTK+ tools (like gtk-query-immodules) generate IMMODULES files and typically store them in system or application directories. While most end-users won’t encounter IMMODULES files, developers or system administrators who build or package GTK+ applications for multilingual environments may need to work with these files to ensure the correct input methods are available."

      "An IMMODULES file is a module configuration file used by applications built with the GTK+ (GIMP Toolkit) framework, which is a library used to create graphical user interfaces (GUIs) on Linux and other Unix-like systems. It contains information about input method modules, which are components that allow users to enter complex characters, such as Chinese or Japanese text, via different input methods."
