      "You will most likely only come across a PPS file if you are using PowerPoint 97 through 2003 or working with someone who uses those versions of the software. If you use PowerPoint 2007 or later and save your presentation as a slide show file it will be saved in the Open XML format with the .PPSX extension.",

      "A PPS file is a slide show created by Microsoft PowerPoint, a popular program included with Microsoft Office for creating presentations. It is saved as a completed slide show, which can be viewed by PowerPoint, OpenOffice, and several other presentation programs. PPS files are similar to .PPT files but open as a slide show when double-clicked."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open and edit PPS files with Microsoft PowerPoint in Windows and macOS. PowerPoint is the best software for opening PPS files because it fully supports the formatting of the slide show. PowerPoint is also available for Android and iOS devices.",
      "Several other presentation programs can open PPS files but they may not fully support the formatting of the slide show files. Alternative programs include Apache OpenOffice Impress (multiplatform), Ability Office (Windows), and Apple Keynote (Mac). If you are a Mac user simply looking to view a PPS file, you can use Apple Preview, which comes bundled with macOS.",
      "You can also open PPS files with various web programs. Google Slides is a free option you can access with a Google account. The web tool allows you to upload a PPS file and view, edit, save, and convert the slide show."
