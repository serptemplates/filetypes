      "Delta RPMs are used by software managers such as Fedora's Presto plugin for yum. When this plugin downloads a DRPM file, it uses existing RPM package information on the system as well as the DRPM file to reconstruct a full RPM. By using this method, files already on the local system do not have to be redownloaded."
