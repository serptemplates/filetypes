      "Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII is a prequel to Final Fantasy VII, the classic PlayStation RPG published by Square in 1997. In Crisis Core, players play as SOLDIER Zack Fair and progress through a series of events that take place seven years before Final Fantasy VII.",
      "While Crisis Core: Final Fantasy VII was published for only the PSP, Final Fantasy and PSP enthusiasts have created versions of the game that can be played on a PC using a PSP emulator. Most players are content to simply play the game on their PC, but others sometimes examine and modify the game's files, including its FF7CCMODEL files."

It contains a character, monster, prop, or environmental feature that appears in the game.
