      "Users most likely to encounter WTX files are those with Windows 7 configurations where WTX files are set as a default file type association for basic text editing. In some cases, software developers choose uncommon file extensions like .wtx to avoid conflicts with more common extensions (like .txt), especially if their program needs to recognize and handle certain text files differently."
