      "ADMX files control what users are capable of doing on their computer. For example, an ADMX file in a work environment may restrict access to the Internet or downloading certain types of files. Windows 7 administrators can access local policies using the Local Group Policy Editor MMC snap-in (.MSC file), which is named gpedit.msc and is located in the \\​Windows\\​System32\\​ directory.",
      "Windows Group Policy is often setup with Active Directory, a permissions manager. It can also work with other supporting permissions technologies.",
      "ADMX files can be exported to a tab-delimited text file using the ADM File Parser (AdmX) command-line tool. The tool is included with the Windows Server 2003 Resource Kit Tools package.",
      "NOTE: ADMX files were introduced with Windows Vista and Windows Server 2008."
