      "UTXT files are similar to .TXT files, which are much more common. While many programs support UTXT files, they typically save plain text files with the .txt file extension.",
      "Additionally, UTXT files typically use the following encoding standards:",
      "UTF-8 – The most common and widely used encoding, as it is efficient for English and Western European languages while still supporting all Unicode characters.",
      "UTF-16 – Sometimes used when files contain a large number of non-Latin characters, such as Chinese, Japanese, or Arabic text.",
      "UTF-32 – Less common, but occasionally used when applications require fixed-width character encoding for easier processing."

      "A UTXT file is a plain text file encoded in Unicode, a character encoding standard that supports multiple languages and symbols. It stores text-based data, such as configuration settings, application resources, or structured information. The Unicode encoding ensures that UTXT files can correctly display characters from different languages, making them particularly useful for applications requiring multilingual support."
