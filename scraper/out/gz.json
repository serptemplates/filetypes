      "GZ files often store .TAR archives that contain multiple files, such as video, image, audio, and backup files. TAR files compressed with gzip compression typically have a .tar.gz or .tgz file extension and are known as \"tarballs.\" You must first decompress these files then expand them with a TAR utility."

This format was initially developed to replace compression formats on UNIX systems. and is still one of the most common archive types on Linux systems. Applications such as WinZip can open GZ files to view its contents on both Windows and MacOS.",
