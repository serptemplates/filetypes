      "Pixelmator Pro is an Adobe Photoshop equivalent that allows photographers and graphic designers to make non-destructive, layer-based edits to their images. You can edit images, add graphic design elements, remove unwanted imperfections, and even design and draw images from scratch with Pixelmator Pro.",
      "When you save an image with Pixelmator Pro, the app saves it as a PXD file. PXD files not only store image data but also contain a record of the edits applied to the image. You can save, close, and re-open an image, then continue to adjust previous edits. For example, if you add a text layer to an image before saving the image as a PXD file and closing Pixelmator Pro, you will still be able to adjust that layer after re-opening the PXD file."

It is the native format for saving images in Pixelmator Pro and includes image layers, adjustments, effects, and other edits made to the image.
