      "A file with .cff extension is a Compact Font Format and is also known as a PostScript Type 1, or CIDFont. CFF acts as a container to store multiple fonts together in a single unit known as a FontSet. The design of CFF fonts allow embedding PostScript language code that permits additional flexibility and extensibility of the format for usage with printer environments. CFF font files can be opened and converted using APIs such as Aspose.Font.",
      "CAD file format used for storing 3D packaging and die cutting designs; may be processed by either a compatible CAD software program or a CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) device."
