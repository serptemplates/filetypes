      "In 2020, the Joint Video Exploration Team (JVET) established the H.266 video codec. It is the successor to the H.265 codec (which is sometimes used to create .H265 files).",
      "The H.266 codec offers up to 50 percent better compression than the H.265 (HEVC) codec. This means the same video, saved at the same level of quality, will have a much smaller file size when saved using the H.266 codec. Because the H.266 codec can compress videos to such small sizes, it can be used to deliver 4K, 16K, and 360º videos over a network.",
      "NOTE: JVET is comprised of members from the Motion Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and the International Telegraph Union (ITU)."

      "An H266 file is a video saved using the H.266 video compression standard. The H.266 standard is also referred to as Versatile Video Coding (VVC). Therefore, you may see H266 files referred to as VVC files."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "Because H266 files are uncommon, most media players cannot open them. You can use Spin Digital VVC Media Player to open H266 files in Windows and Linux. You can use MX Player to open H266 files in Android. If you want to decode an H266 file, you can use Fraunhofer VVdeC (multiplatform)."
