      "A BK! file is a temporary backup of a .WPD document created by Corel WordPerfect, a word processing application. It stores the exact same information as the WPD document to help prevent data loss. BK! files typically have the same name as the original document, with the .bk! extension added to the end (e.g., document.wpd.bk!)."

      "BK! files are not meant to be opened by users, since Corel WordPerfect typically manages them automatically. However, if you need to recover a document manually, you can rename the BK! file by removing the .bk! extension and changing it to .wpd. After renaming the file, you can open the WPD document with WordPerfect as you would with any regular document."
