      "In Chrome OS, Linux developers and enthusiasts can use the operating system's Turn on Linux setting to create a Linux container. This container is known as Crostini. Crostini allows Linux users to install and open Linux apps in Chrome OS, so they can develop using Linux tools and open Linux-specific files.",
      "All a Crostini user's Linux files are either marked as Shared with Linux or stored in a user's Linux files directory. If a Chrome OS user wants to back up their Linux files, they can do so by selecting the Linux (Beta) → Back up and restore setting from Chrome OS's Settings menu. When a Crostini user backs up their Linux files, Chrome saves the backup as a TINI file. TINI files are useful if a developer wants to restore their Crostini environment in the event of an accidental data loss, or they want to transfer their Crostini environment to another Chrome OS device."

      "A TINI file is a backup of a Linux environment created in Crostini, a Chrome OS app that allows users to run Linux in Chrome. It contains a copy of all the data saved within a user's Crostini environment. TINI files are gzipped TAR files, so they can be opened in other operating systems using any .TGZ or .TAR.GZ decompression utility."

      "In Chrome OS, you can use a TINI file to restore your Crostini environment to the state saved in the TINI file. To do so:",

      "Next to Restore from a previous backup, select Restore. Click through the confirmation message that appears and, again, select Restore.",
      "Select your TINI file, and then select Open.",
      "In other operating systems, you can rename a TINI file to use the .tgz or .tar.gz extensions and decompress it to examine its contents. For example, you can rename your TINI file to use the .tgz extension and use Apple Archive Utility or 7-Zip to decompress it."
