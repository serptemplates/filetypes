      "A developer creating a video game with Unreal Editor can cook assets they're using in the game, which strips out some pre-processing data. When a developer does this, the asset is transformed from a single UASSET file into a set of three files: a UASSET file, a UEXP file, and a UBULK file. These files are often saved in a PAK archive.",
