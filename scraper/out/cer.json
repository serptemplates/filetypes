      "A file with an extension .cer is responsible for storing some information about the owner certificate and the specific public key. This format of files cannot store the private keys and have the capacity to store only one certificate which is x509. The specifically secured certificate authorities are those which belong to HTTPS, a trusted and secured protocol for browsingThe CER is a certificate of your server. It is usually received by the certificate authority for the domain. CER is mostly considered the same as CRT, although both are the same format of SSL certificate but are different filename extensions. These can be used on operating systems by simply opening a browser and checking the security of the browser or website being used.",
      "A CER file is a security file provided by a third-party Certificate Authority, such as VeriSign or Thawte, that verifies the authenticity of a website. It is installed on a web server to establish the validity of a particular website hosted on the server."
