      "The WAC file stores a sketch in XML format, which makes it easier for the sketch data to be read by text editors and humans. The .WPI file, which contains a sketch just as the WAC file does, uses a binary format.",
      "Inkling consists of a pen, receiver, and the Inkling Sketch Manager application. The pen and receiver pick up your movements along with the pressure level of your pen strokes, as you sketch and convert them into a digital image, which is a WPI file. The image can then be viewed and edited with Inkling Sketch Manager. The WPI file can also be saved as a WAC file or exported to Photoshop, Illustrator, and SketchBook Pro for further editing.",
