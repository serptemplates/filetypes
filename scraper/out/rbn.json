      "Frustrated with other Bridge notation formats, Richard Pavlicek created the Richard's Bridge Notation, or RBN, format. According to Pavlicek, the RBN format fixes issues with both the Portable Bridge Notation (.PBN) and Bridge Base (.LIN) formats. Most notably, RBN files order information about a Bridge deal \"more logically\" and can contain information about many deals.",
