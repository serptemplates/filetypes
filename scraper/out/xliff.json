      "An XLIFF file is a localization file that stores language translation data in the XML Localization Interchange File Format (XLIFF) standard. It contains the original text from a software program or document, along with its translations into one or more target languages. The Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards (OASIS) developed the XLIFF format to make it easier to exchange translation information among different localization tools."
