      "A file with .dar extension is a compressed archive created using the DAR Disk archive. It can create backup/archive for full disk or a group of files. It was created to replace the TAR file format on UNIX OS and can be created as split archive files for large number of files. DAR archive supports option of deleting files from the system which are linked to the main files in the archive. Its capabilities of providing differential, Incremental, and Decremental backup makes it superior than TAR files.",
