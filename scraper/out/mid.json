      "A file having .MID or.MIDI file extension is the Musical Instrument Digital (MID) Interface file. It is the difference from ordinary audio files such as WAVs or MP3s in that it doesn’t carry the actual audio content; hence, is quite smaller in size. The content includes the notes played, their timing, duration, and desired loudness for each note.\n\nThe MID file fundamentally consists of information explaining how should the sound be heard when linked with the playback device or loaded into a specific software that interprets audio data. This makes it an ideal tool for sharing musical data between compatible apps and over a low-bandwidth connection. The smaller size enables easy storage for which even floppy disks can be used.",
      "A MID file is a standard Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) file used by music authoring software and MIDI-compatible hardware devices. It contains musical performance data, such as the notes that are played, when they are played, how long they are held, and how loud each note sounds. MID files do not store actual audio data."
