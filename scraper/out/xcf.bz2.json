      "GIMP is a layer-based image editor similar to Adobe Photoshop. Most users save images they are editing with GIMP as XCF files, but they may also export images as compressed archives to reduce their size.",

It is compressed to reduce its size for backup or transfer purposes. Users can open XCF.BZ2 files with GIMP the same way as XCF files, or they may decompress them with a bzip2 compression utility first, then open the XCF files with GIMP."
