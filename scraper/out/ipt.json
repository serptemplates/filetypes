      "Autodesk Inventor is a computer-aided design (CAD) application that engineers and product designers use to prototype mechanical products. These prototypes, referred to as assemblies, consist of a number of individual parts that a user has joined together. Each Inventor part is saved in its own IPT file.",
      "Inventor users can import parts from outside the program or create their own parts using Inventor's part design tools. Typically, users begin by creating a 2D drawing of a part, before transforming that drawing into a 3D model. Thus, an IPT file may contain a 2D or 3D object."

      "A file with .ipt extension is native Autodesk’s Inventor Part file format for parts. It is used in combination with Autodesk assembly (.iam) files. IPT files can be imported in 3DS Max as Body Objects where the geometry in the ACIS solids format remains in the same format. 3DS Max retains the object naming as assigned in Autodesk Inventor and the component models can be edited similar to other objects including applying modifiers, alter materials, add lighting and cameras, create animation, and so on. You can open IPT files with applications such as Autodesk Inventor and Autodesk Fusion.",
      "An IPT file is a 2D or 3D model created by Autodesk Inventor, a program used to design 3D product prototypes. It contains a part that is meant to be combined with other parts to form an assembly (.IAM file)."
