      "You may encounter an MKA file in a variety of ways, including downloading audio from the Internet or receiving audio recordings from co-workers, family members, or friends. While MKA files are typically used to save songs, they may also be used to save whole albums in one file. The MKA format allows individual audio tracks to be divided into chapters and also supports lyrics or .SRT subtitle transcriptions to be embedded into an MKA file.",
      "The Matroska multimedia container format is open source and was originally released in December 2002. The container format can store any number of video, audio, image, and subtitle tracks.",
      "The files that utilize the Matroska container format use different file extensions depending on the data they contain. Matroska files that only store subtitle data use the \".MKS\" extension and files that store video data (and possibly audio and subtitle data) use the \".MKV\" extension. Audio files stored in the Matroska container format use the .mka file extension.",
      "NOTE: The Matroska name comes from the Russian Matryoshka doll that contains numerous smaller, nested dolls of the same shape."
