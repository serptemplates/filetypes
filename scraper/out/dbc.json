      "The DBC data consists of the following elements:\n\nSimple DBC Message\n\nA simple DBC message consists of the Message ID, and at least one signal. Following is a demonstration of a message that consists of a single 8-bit signal.\n\nBO_ 500 IO_DEBUG: 4 IO SG_ IO_DEBUG_test_unsigned : 0|8@1+ (1,0) [0|0] \"\" DBG\n\nSigned signals\n\nA signed signal can be sent by applying a negative offset to a signal. Following is an example of signed signal to the previous message.\n\nBO_ 500 IO_DEBUG: 4 IO SG_ IO_DEBUG_test_unsigned : 0|8@1+ (1,0) [0|0] \"\" DBG SG_ IO_DEBUG_test_signed : 8|8@1- (1,-128) [0|0] \"\" DBG\n\nFractional Signals\n\nA fractional signal can be sent by deciding the range, and the precision if required.\n\nBO_ 500 IO_DEBUG: 4 IO SG_ IO_DEBUG_test_unsigned : 0|8@1+ (1,0) [0|0] \"\" DBG SG_ IO_DEBUG_test_signed : 8|8@1- (1,-128) [0|0] \"\" DBG SG_ IO_DEBUG_test_float1 : 16|8@1+ (0.1,0) [0|0] \"\" DBG SG_ IO_DEBUG_test_float2 : 24|12@1+ (0.01,-20.48) [-20.48|20.47] \"\" DBG\n\nEnumeration Types\n\nAn enumeration type is used when the user wants to see names, instead of numbers. See the following example.\n\nBO_ 500 IO_DEBUG: 4 IO SG_ IO_DEBUG_test_enum : 8|8@1+ (1,0) [0|0] \"\" DBG BA_ \"FieldType\" SG_ 500 IO_DEBUG_test_enum \"IO_DEBUG_test_enum\"; VAL_ 500 IO_DEBUG_test_enum 2 \"IO_DEBUG_test2_enum_two\" 1 \"IO_DEBUG_test2_enum_one\" ;\n\nMultiplexed Message\n\ndefining a multiplexed messages that uses a single message ID is an option, however, they are decoded differently depending on which multipexed value was sent. In order to send a multiplexed message below, a separate message have to be sent:\n\nBO_ 200 SENSOR_SONARS: 8 SENSOR SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_mux M : 0|4@1+ (1,0) [0|0] \"\" DRIVER,IO SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_err_count : 4|12@1+ (1,0) [0|0] \"\" DRIVER,IO SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_left m0 : 16|12@1+ (0.1,0) [0|0] \"\" DRIVER,IO SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_middle m0 : 28|12@1+ (0.1,0) [0|0] \"\" DRIVER,IO SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_right m0 : 40|12@1+ (0.1,0) [0|0] \"\" DRIVER,IO SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_rear m0 : 52|12@1+ (0.1,0) [0|0] \"\" DRIVER,IO SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_no_filt_left m1 : 16|12@1+ (0.1,0) [0|0] \"\" DBG SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_no_filt_middle m1 : 28|12@1+ (0.1,0) [0|0] \"\" DBG SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_no_filt_right m1 : 40|12@1+ (0.1,0) [0|0] \"\" DBG SG_ SENSOR_SONARS_no_filt_rear m1 : 52|12@1+ (0.1,0) [0|0] \"\" DBG",

      "The files with .dbc extension are also known as CAN database files. The DBC file is a simple text file that consists of information for decoding raw CAN bus data to physical values or in human readable form. The DBC file is introduced, because this is the very common way to manage identification and translation of the data. The DBC file type was developed to provide the means of record keeping as described in a CAN network.",
