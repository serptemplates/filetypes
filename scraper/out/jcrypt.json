      "JCRYPT is a Web-based service that requires an online account. Once logged in, you can upload files (via SSL only) to be encrypted. You then receive an encoded file to store locally on your computer. This file can only be decrypted by the service.",
      "JCRYPT files can only be decrypted by the user who encrypted the files, or by a user for whom the creator of the file has granted access. In the case that another user has been given access, the creator of the file can also specify an expiration date for when the file is no longer usable.",
      "NOTE: Instead of using the webpage user interface, JCRYPT also provides a Web Service (a .WSDL file) to interact with the service."
