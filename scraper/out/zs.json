      "The ZenScript programming language was originally developed for use with CraftTweaker, a Minecraft mod that enables gamers to modify content, which includes \"recipes\" These recipes allow users to create new items with resources they gather. The ZenScript programming language is primarily used by modders to add, edit, and delete recipes in the game.",
      "Since ZS files store commands in plain text, you can open and edit the files with any text editor. However, select text editors, such as Notepad++, Visual Studio Code, and Sublime Text, are better options for editing ZS files since they support syntax highlighting of the ZenScript language or plugins that support the language.",
      "NOTE: ZS files must be stored in the [gamedir]/​scripts folder to be loaded when a player joins a world in Minecraft."
