      "Bzip2 is a free file compression utility that compresses files using the Burrows-Wheeler compression algorithm and Huffman encoding. After bzip2 compresses a file, it changes that file's name to filename.bz2.",
      "Unlike .ZIP files and other compressed archives, BZ2 files only ever contain a single compressed file. However, you can use bzip2 to compress multiple files at once, which will create a series of BZ2 files."

    "description": [
      "BZ2 are compressed files generated using the BZIP2 open source compression method, mostly on UNIX or Linux system. It is used for compression of a single file and is not meant for archiving of multiple files. This is in contrast to the TAR file format on the same platforms that archives multiple files into a single file but without compression. Files compressed as BZ2 can be decompressed with applications like WinZip. BZIP2 uses Run-Length Encoding (RLE) or Burrows-Wheeler compression algorithm to achieve high levels of compression.",
      "A BZ2 file is a file that has been compressed by bzip2, a compression program often found on Unix-based systems. Unlike compressed archives, BZ2 files always contain only a single compressed file. BZ2 files often contain compressed software packages, used to install Linux programs."
