      "An STR file is a recording file created by YouTube for a livestream that was hosted by user’s streaming event. The file is saved automatically by Youtube at its backend once the live streaming is over. A live streaming video can be broadcasted to multiple channels so as audience can interact with publisher via comments. These SRT files are accessible using YouTube livestream API that provides access to the YouTube’s servers.",
      "An STR file defines the structure of a database (.DBF file) created by dBASE, a database management application. It contains a text-based list of all the objects in the database file, including the number of fields, names of each field, and specifications (width and height) of each database field. dBASE uses STR files to create printed archive index tables and document the structure of each table."
