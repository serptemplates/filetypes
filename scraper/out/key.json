      "Typically, the software developer distributes a KEY file to a user after they purchase the software to register an application offline. The user may then need to place the file in a specific directory or open it with the application to register the software.",

      "A KEY file is the private part of a security mechanism that is saved to disc in Privacy-Enhanced Mal (PEM) file format. It is used to decrypt information exchanged between a web browser and the web server that serves the browsing requests. A KEY file contains encoded strings that are useless for human eye but are the essence of encrypting/decrypting information exchange as part of SSL certificate on web servers. KEY files are automatically generated and are installed at client end.\n\nYou can open KEY files with any text editor such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows), Apple TextEdit (Mac), or GitHub Atom (cross-platform). KEY files are similar to CRT and CER file formats.",
      "A KEY file contains a license key an application references to register itself to a computer on which it is installed. It may save the key in a plain text format but typically stores an encrypted key string that authenticates the purchase and registers the software. The .key file extension is a generic file extension for software license keys used by various programs to register legal copies of the software."
