      "The NB file type is the native file format for saving Mathematica notebooks. Wolfram Research released the Mathematica Notebook (NB) format in 1988.",

      "An NB file is a structured document created by Wolfram Research Mathematica, an application used for mathematical and scientific computation. It contains the elements that comprise a document, which may include text, images, audio, hyperlinks, functions, and interactive user interface elements in plain text in the Wolfram Language expression syntax. Users typically open NB files with Wolfram Research Mathematica and the free Wolfram Research CDF Player."

      "Since NB files store notebook information in plain text, you can view them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad in Windows, Apple TextEdit in macOS, or gedit in Linux. However, opening NB files with a plain text editor will not display them the same as Mathematica or Wolfram Player, which displays them natively."
