      "WRUI files are encrypted, so you cannot open them. In some cases, you may be able to revert a WRUI file to its original form by renaming it to use its previous extension. For example, you can rename an encrypted JPG from yourjpg.wrui to yourjpg.jpg and attempt to open it. This may allow you to open some of your renamed files but likely will not work on all your files.",
      "While Emsisoft offers a Decryptor for STOP ransomware, it works only for STOP variants that use offline decryption keys. The WRUI variant uses online decryption keys, so Emsisoft's decryptor cannot decrypt WRUI files."
