      "Cryptomator is a file encryption app that allows users to store files in a virtual drive and then lock that drive. Locking the drive encrypts the stored files, using AES-256 encryption. Often, users place their Cryptomator drives in cloud storage services, so they can access the drives (and the files they contain) from multiple devices.",
      "Files encrypted by Cryptomator use the .c9r extension, to denote they've been encrypted. These files also have encrypted filenames produced using AES-SIV encryption. Thus, a file previously named Example.rtf may have a filename like eHwTYFBFYdmnj2cVBF-hgHXjoH7sVD4ZUwpz.c9r after being encrypted by Cryptomator."

To add a vault to Cryptomator, select Add Vault → Open Existing Vault. Then, follow the prompts to add your vault to Cryptomator and unlock its contents (you will likely have to enter the password used to lock the vault)."
