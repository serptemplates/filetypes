      "Advanced users, developers, or hobbyists who want to run full Linux-based systems or other operating environments within Android are the primary users of Vectras VM. They often use the software for testing, learning, or software development without needing a separate physical computer.",
      "The CVBI format bundles all the components needed to run a complete operating system, such as a preinstalled Linux or Windows environment, within Vectras VM. This portable virtual machine package streamlines the process for users by eliminating the need to configure complex virtualization settings manually.",
      "NOTE: The Vectras VM VBI format is similar to the .VBI format, but it is a customized version. It includes the base VM image (VBI) along with additional configuration."

      "A CVBI file is a customized virtual machine (VM) image used by Vectras VM, an Android app that allows users to run virtual machines on mobile devices. It stores a preconfigured virtual machine, which may include an operating system, applications, and file system data. Vectras VM reads the contents of a CVBI file to set up and launch a virtual environment on an Android device."
