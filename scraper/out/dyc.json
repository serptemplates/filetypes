      "Xerox printer drivers create and use DYC files when users install and configure the drivers. System administrators and IT staff may apply these files when updating or standardizing printer settings across multiple devices, ensuring that each printer uses consistent defaults. In some cases, users may encounter DYC files when updating their printer driver software, since the files help apply new configuration values without requiring manual setup."
