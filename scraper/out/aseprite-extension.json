      "As of version 1.2, Aseprite users have been able to install user-created plug-ins that contain additional features. Aseprite's documentation refers to these plug-ins as extensions. Each Aseprite extension is saved as an ASEPRITE-EXTENSION file.",
      "ASEPRITE-EXTENSION files are ZIP files that have been renamed to use the .aseprite-extension extension, so Aseprite can recognize and load them more easily. The files' contents differ based on the type of feature they are used to install. For example, an ASEPRITE-EXTENSION file used to install an additional language will contain a .JSON and .INI file, while an ASEPRITE-EXTENSION file used to install a new theme will contain a JSON, .XML, .PNG, and ASEPRITE-DATA file."
