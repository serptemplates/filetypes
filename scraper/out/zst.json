      "A ZST file is a compressed file that is generated with the Zstandard (zstd) compression algorithm. It is a compressed file that is created with lossless compression by the algorithm. ZST files can be used to compress different types of files such as databases, file systems, networks, and games. The Zstandard is governed by RFC 8878 that describes the overall compression mechanism, media type, and content encoding.",
      "A ZST file is a file compressed with the Zstandard (zstd) compression algorithm. It contains a file compressed with lossless compression at a level specified by the user. ZST files are used for reducing file sizes for various purposes, such as databases, file systems, networks, and games."
