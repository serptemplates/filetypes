      "A file wiht .ndf extension is a secondary database file used by Microsoft SQL Server to store user data. NDF is secondary storage file because SQL server stores user specified data in primary storage file known as MDF. NDF data file is optional and is user-defined to manage data storage in case the primary MDF file uses all the allocated space. It is usually stored on separate disk and can spread to multiple storage devices. The presence of MDF files is necessary in order to open NDF files.",
      "Secondary database file used by Microsoft SQL Server; created when the primary .MDF database becomes too large (such as when there is no disk space left); may also be manually added to the SQL Server File Group to distribute data between the two files."
