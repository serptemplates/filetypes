      "Much like a .ZIP file, an XZ file contains files that have been compressed so they can be stored and shared with others more easily. Users often use XZ files to share compressed files over the Internet, via email, and on USB drives.",
      "XZ compression compresses files to smaller sizes than some alternatives, such as gzip and bzip2 compression. For this reason, XZ archives often contain compressed versions of large files, such as Slackware Linux package distributions and .ISO files.",
      "NOTE: XZ files that contain a .TAR archive are saved as .TXZ files."

    "description": [
      "XZ is a compressed file format that utilizes the LZMA2 compression algorithm. It was designed as a replacement for the popular gzip and bzip2 formats, and offers a number of advantages over these older standards. XZ files are well-supported across many platforms, and can be decompressed quickly and easily. While they are not as common as ZIP or RAR files, XZ archives can be used to store large amounts of data without sacrificing compression quality. If you need to compress or decompress large files, the XZ file extension is worth considering.",
      "An XZ file is an archive compressed using XZ compression, a high-ratio compression algorithm based on the LZMA algorithm. It contains one or more files compressed by the xz command-line tool included with XZ Utils."
