      "While creating a pattern in Plushify, sewists can manually alter the pattern's seams and add colors and markings to visualize how their plushie will look in real life. They can also adjust their pattern's (and thus plushie's) size, and modify other pattern settings.",
      "If a sewist wants to save a copy of their Plushify project (e.g., because they plan to re-use it in the future), they can do so by selecting the Save button found in Plushify's upper-right corner. This saves the project as a PLUSH file. Each PLUSH file consists of JSON-formatted plain text that describes the 3D model from which the sewist created their pattern, as well as the edits they've made in Plushify. Plushify uses this plain text data to load and display a sewist's 3D model and pattern."

      "A PLUSH file contains a 3D model and accompanying sewing pattern created by Plushify, an online plushie pattern tool. Sewists use Plushify to import a 3D model (.OBJ file) and create, edit, and print a resulting sewing pattern (.PDF file). They then use the pattern to sew a real-life, plushie version of the 3D model."
