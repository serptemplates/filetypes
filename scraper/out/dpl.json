      "Embarcadero Delphi is an integrated development environment (IDE) that creates Windows, macOS, iOS, Android, and Linux applications. Developers use DPL files to extend Delphi applications by dynamically loading and linking libraries at runtime. This is particularly useful for component-based development, where custom user interface (UI) elements, database drivers, or other functionality can be packaged separately and integrated as needed, which makes development more efficient by reducing redundancy and ensuring consistency across projects..",
      "NOTE: Versions 3 and earlier of Delphi used DPL files until Embarcadero Technologies replaced them with .BPL files in version 4."

      "A DPL file is a dynamically linked library (DLL) used by Embarcadero Delphi and designed specifically for modular application development in Delphi’s package system. It contains precompiled components, units, or classes that developers use to package reusable code that functions across Delphi projects."
