      "Typically, CAB files contain Windows system or device driver updates. For example, a CAB file might contain driver updates for a printer. Windows often automatically downloads and installs the updates CAB files contain, using installers such as Setup API, Device Installer, and AdvPack. However, users can also manually download CAB files from the Microsoft Update Catalog.",
      "Additionally, Windows users can create their own CAB files using a command-line utility called makecab. To use makecab, open a Command Prompt window, enter makecab.exe, and press Enter. This will show instructions for how to use makecab.",

      "A CAB file is an archive saved in the Windows Cabinet archive format. The CAB format supports the .ZIP, Quantum, and LZX data compression algorithms.

For example, Corel Winzip (Windows, Mac), 7-Zip (Windows), The Unarchiver (Mac), and ZDevs ZArchiver (Android) all allow users to decompress CAB files and examine their contents.",
