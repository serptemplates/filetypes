      "Winamp is a free media player that allows users to play many types of audio and video files. It also includes several other features, such as the ability to customize the program's appearance using skins.",
      "For much of Winamp's existence, skins were saved as WSZ files. However, with the release of Winamp 3, Nullsoft introduced the WAL, or modern Winamp skin, format.",
      "WAL files are very similar to WSZ files, in that both are simply renamed .ZIP files that include all of a skin's images and other assets. However, while WSZ files use .TXT files to specify how a skin's assets should be applied, WAL files use .XML files."
