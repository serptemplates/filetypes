      "MPEG-1 Audio Layer II is a lossy audio compression format standardized in 1992. In addition to being used for radio and television broadcasts, MP2 was used to compress audio stored on Video CDs (VCDs) and some DVDs. The standard version of the format supports 32, 44.1, and 48 kHz sampling rates and bitrates from 32 to 320 kbps/sec.",

    "description": [
      "An MP2 file, also widely known as an MPA file, is an audio format compressed using MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 Audio Layer II. This lossy audio compression standard was formally defined by ISO/IEC 11172-3, which also established the MPEG-1 Audio Layer I and the vastly more popular MPEG-1 Audio Layer III (MP3). The primary goal of the MP2 format, like its counterparts, was to significantly reduce audio file size. While the MP3 format gained greater mainstream adoption due to its smaller file size and widespread availability online, the MP2 file remains a critical and resilient standard, particularly within the professional realm of audio broadcasting where its specific technical strengths are essential.",
      "An MP2 file is an audio file compressed using MPEG-1 Audio Layer II compression. The .MP3 format has largely replaced the MP2 format. However, MP2 is still used for digital radio and television broadcasts."
