      "You can connect a computer running Graphical Analysis to the Vernier Go! Motion sensor via USB and point the sensor at a moving object, such as a ball, cart, or ramp, to track the object's movement, velocity, and acceleration. As Graphical Analysis collects the data captured by the sensor, you can share and analyze the data in real time. You can then save the data as a GAMBL project by selecting Save from the file menu."

      "A GAMBL file is a project created by Vernier Graphical Analysis, a program for analyzing object movement tracked by the Vernier Go! Motion sensor. It contains one or more recorded data sets organized into tables and graphs. Graphical Analysis users save project data as GAMBL files they can modify and export to other formats, such as .PNG, .CSV, and .PDF files."
