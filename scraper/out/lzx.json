      "A file with .lzx extension was developed by Open Source, which is also known as an Amiga LZX Compressed File, for the associated software of Cabextract. The LZX files are commonly used by the users of the United States, running Windows 10 in their systems. Amiga LZX compressed file is classified as a compressed file combined with compression standards used in files saved in the LZX format. This extension was initially used by applications designed for Amiga computers in the 1990s. the compression and decompression tools of different files are still applied with provision for compressing files and folders selected by the user as an LZX file. These related programs also have different cohesive features that can decompress these LZX files quickly than other archive files compressed with such old compression conditions.",
      "An LZX file is an archive created by the LZX archive utility, which was available for Commodore Amiga computers in the 1990s. It contains one or more compressed files. The LZX format uses compression methods that Microsoft has since incorporated into the .CAB and .CHM formats."
