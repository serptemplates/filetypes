      "A FIRM file is a firmware file used by Boot9Strap, a program used to install custom firmware on a Nintendo 3DS video game console. It contains data used to modify a Nintendo 3DS for various purposes, such as adding support for software, modifying a game, or providing boot-up directions. FIRM files are commonly used for storing Luma3DS firmware."
