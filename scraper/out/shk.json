      "ShrinkIt compresses files to reduce their size, making them easier to store and transfer, especially given the limited storage capacity and slower data transfer rates of the Apple II era. While the format is now deprecated, it remains relevant for enthusiasts and collectors who maintain and preserve software for vintage Apple II computers."

      "An SHK file is a compressed archive created using the ShrinkIt tool, a compression utility specifically designed for the Apple II computer system in the 1980s. It contains one or more files or directories that have been compressed in the ShrinkIt (SHK) format (similar to the standard LZW compression format used on the Apple II), which was widely used to distribute software, games, and data files among Apple II users."
