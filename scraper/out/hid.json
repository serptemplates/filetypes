      "When you choose a video or image to be hidden, KeepSafe appends a string of numbers preceding the filename and the HID extension on to the end of the file. The extension hides the file from being recognized as what it really is, like a .JPG file, and prevents other applications on the device from recognizing the file.",
      "For example, KeepSafe may save an image file as 8945715774357453030.IMG_11429.JPG.HID. The \"8945715774357453030\" is a random string of numbers generated by KeepSafe and \"HID\" is the extension added by the program.",
      "NOTE: The HID extension was replaced by the .KSD extension in 2013."
