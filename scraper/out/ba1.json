      "TaxAct 2021 is a Windows program that U.S. residents can use to prepare and file Federal and State tax returns. While using TaxAct 2021, you can manually create a backup of your 2021 tax return by selecting File → Backup.... (You must first have saved the return as a .TA1 file.) This saves the return as a BA1 file.",
      "The program also automatically creates three additional BA1 files and stores them in its AUTO-BACKUP folder. These files include a current backup, daily backup, and weekly backup. For example, the program's daily backup file is named .ta1_daily.ba1."
