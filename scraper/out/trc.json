These files are created by a software SQL Server Profiler; usually packaged with Microsoft SQL Server software. The database administrators can analyze a sequence of database statements and can review the trace log if some kind of errors or warnings are suspected. These files are usually located in the typical LOG folder of MSSQL inside the Program Files directory on a Windows operating system.",
