      "When a Rhapsody user attempts to play a song, Rhapsody uses an RMA file to check whether the user's computer is authorized to play that song. This is how Rhapsody performs Digital Rights Management (DRM). Rhapsody's DRM also prevents users from sharing downloaded music with others.",
      "RMA files are often confused with .RM, .RA, and .RAM files, which are also RealNetworks files. However, those file types are associated with RealPlayer media, not Rhapsody.",
      "NOTE: In 2016, RealNetworks rebranded Rhapsody as Napster. It is unknown whether Napster still uses RMA files to perform DRM functions."
