      "A YDD file is a 3D model used in Grand Theft Auto V, an open-world action-adventure game published by Rockstar Games. It contains a character feature, such as a head, facial feature, hair, or article of clothing. YDD files are similar to .YDR files, which contain Grand Theft Auto V 3D objects."

They can then modify the file as they see fit before exporting it and loading it into GTA V using OpenIV. For more complete instructions, refer to this YouTube video."
