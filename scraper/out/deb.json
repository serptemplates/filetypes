      "Debian, Ubuntu, and other supported Linux distribution users install and manage DEB files using either the Debian package management system (dpkg) or APT package management software. Users can also decompress DEB files to view their contents before installation. The TAR archives that DEB files contain are commonly compressed using bzip or gzip compression.",

      "A file with .deb extension is a Debian binary package file format available for distribution of software packages on Linux OS. It consists of two TAR archive files. The DPKG provides the mechanism to read and install the DEB packages. DEB packages can be installed using the APT package software management interface. DEB files have Internet Media Type as application/vnd.debian.binary-package.",
      "A DEB file is a software package used by the Debian Linux distribution and its variants, such as Ubuntu. DEB files are used primarily to install or update Unix applications. Each DEB file is a standard Unix archive that contains two .TAR archives: one for installer control information and another for installable data."
