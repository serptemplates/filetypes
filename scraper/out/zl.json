      "A file with .zl extension is a ZLIP compressed file format that uses a variant of DEFLATE compression algorithm for compressing files. It is independent of CPU type, operating system, file system, and character set, and hence can be used for interchange of information. Technical specifications of ZLIP compression are available on the IETF site and can be referred from developer’s perspective.",
