      "LASTZ, and its predecessor BLASTZ, are nucleotide local alignment programs that support human chromosomes. The programs can import FASTA and NIB DNA sequences and output them in the LAV format. The LAV format was developed by Webb Miller and his group at the Miller Lab at Penn State University (PSU)."
