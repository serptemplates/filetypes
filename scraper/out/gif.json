      "GIFs are a common format for web graphics, especially small images and images that contain text, such as navigation buttons. However, JPEG (.JPG) images are better for showing photos because they are not as limited in the number of colors they can display.",
      "GIF images can also be animated and saved as \"animated GIFs,\" which are often used to display basic animations on websites. They may also include transparent pixels, allowing them to blend with different color backgrounds. However, pixels in a GIF image must be either fully transparent or fully opaque, so the transparency cannot be faded like a .PNG image.",

      "A GIF or Graphical Interchange Format is a type of highly compressed image. Owned by Unisys, GIF uses the LZW compression algorithm that does not degrade the image quality. For each image GIF typically allow up to 8 bits per pixel and up to 256 colours are allowed across the image. In contrast to a JPEG image, which can display up to 16 million colours and fairly touches the limits of the human eye. Back when the internet emerged, GIFs remained the best choice because they required low bandwidth and compatible for the graphics that consume solid areas of colour. An animated GIF combines numerous images or frames into a single file and displays them in a sequence to generate an animated clip or a short video. The colour limitations are up to 256 for each frame and are likely to be the least suitable for reproducing other images and photographs with colour gradient.",
      "A GIF file is an image saved in the Graphical Interchange Format (GIF). It may contain up to 256 indexed colors, with a color palette that may be a predefined set of colors or adapted to the colors in the image. GIF files are saved in a lossless format, meaning that the GIF compression does not degrade the image's clarity."
