      "3DZ files are not meant to be opened on a computer. They were created for Gateway 3DS, which is software stored on a microSD card that is inserted into a Nintendo 3DS. However, if you rename the \".3dz\" extension to \".3ds\", and remove the header in the file, the ROM may be playable by 3DS emulators, such as TronDS or Citra."

      "A 3DZ file is a game file used by Gateway 3DS, a microSD card for Nintendo 3DS used to play 3DS, DS, and homebrew games. It contains a copy of the data from an original 3DS game cartridge. 3DZ files are saved in the same format as the more popular .3DS files but contain a header which indicates to Gateway that it is compatible for online play."
