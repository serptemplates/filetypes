      "A file with .tbz extension is a compressed archive that uses BZIP compression for reducing the size of the content files. The TBZ files are actually UNIX TAR archived files that are compressed with BZIP then. The most recent second level compression is BZIP2 that replaced BZIP. TBZ file format is suitable for transferring large files. TBZ files can be opened/extracted using software applications such as 7-Zip, PeaZip, and jZip. Linux and macOS users can also open a TBZ with the BZIP2 command from a terminal window.",
