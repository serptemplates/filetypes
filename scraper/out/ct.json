      "A CT (Continuous Tone) file is a raster image file used by Scitex graphics processing equipment. Several graphics suites such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, and QuarkXPress supports its usage for rendering. Data image is stored inside the CT file in CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow Key), RGB, and grayscale image formats, but they don’t support alpha channels. CT files can be opened with applications such as Adobe Photoshop 2022, Adobe InDesign 2022, and XnViewMP.",
      "A CT file is a data file created by Cheat Engine, an open source program used to create \"cheats,\" or modifications, to Windows-based games. It contains game overrides and their address locations within the target program. CT files allow users to edit game properties, such as numbers of lives, high scores, and units of health."
