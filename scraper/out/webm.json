      "A file with a .webm extension is a video file based on the open, royalty-free WebM file format. It has been designed for sharing video on the web and defines the file container structure including video and audio formats. WebM is 100% free, implementing high-quality based on open technologies such as HTML, HTTP, and TCP/IP which are open to anyone for implementation. WebM has been specifically designed for serving video on the web which makes it optimized for streaming with a low computational footprint. This makes it suitable for videos playback on any device especially low-power netbooks, handhelds, and tablets.",

WebM uses a container structure similar to the Matroska (.MKV) video format, which stores both audio and video data. Video is compressed using a VP8 or VP9 codec, and audio is compressed with either the Vorbis or Opus audio codec."
