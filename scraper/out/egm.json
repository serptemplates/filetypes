      "FaceGen Modeller allows video game developers and other 3D artists to create realistic, animatable 3D faces and heads. Primarily, these 3D models are comprised of TRI files and textures applied to those meshes (often saved as .TGA files).",
      "However, users can also morph the models they create, modifying that model's default appearance. For example, a user can create a variant of a face in which that face's eyes are closed. The statistical shape information that FaceGen Modeller uses to create morphs is saved as an EGM file. Each model's EGM file is typically saved alongside its TRI file."
