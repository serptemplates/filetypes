      "An MPLS file is a Blu-ray playlist that defines the playback order of video clips on a Blu-ray disc, including the order of chapters and branching video paths (like language or viewing options). It does not contain actual video or audio data, but instead lists the sequence of media files, known as \"M2TS streams,\" that make up a full movie or feature. MPLS files are typically named with a five-digit code (e.g., 00001.mpls) and is saved in the BDMV/PLAYLIST folder on the disc."
