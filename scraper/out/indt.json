      "A file with .indt extension is an Adobe InDesign layout template file that contains predefined settings. The design and contents of these files include templates of newsletters, books, magazines, flyer, and print media. Once editing is finished, the INDT file can be saved to disc as INDD file. User can also create new INDT file from within the InDesign and convert it to other formats such as PDF, EPUB, or JPEG.",
      "An INDT file is a layout template created by Adobe InDesign, a desktop publishing program. It contains a print, web, or mobile layout and includes design settings and content, such as text and images. INDT files are helpful for InDesign users looking to create multiple designs that feature similar layouts or content."

This way, you won’t accidentally change the main template.\n\nYou need Adobe InDesign to open or edit an INDT file. You cannot use other programs because INDT is made just for InDesign. However, you can share INDT files with others who use InDesign, even if they have a different version, and the design will stay the same.",
      "You can open INDT files with Adobe InDesign in Windows and macOS. To open an INDT file with InDesign, select File → Open..., navigate to your file location, select the file, and click Open. You can also double-click the INDT file to open it if it is associated with InDesign."
