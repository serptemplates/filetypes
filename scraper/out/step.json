      "The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the STEP format to make it easier to share models between users with different CAD systems in the CAD industry. Since its release in 1994, STEP has become a standardized, widely-supported format that CAD users can use to save and transfer models between users and programs.",
      "While STEP files appear as 3D models in CAD programs, they consist of plain text that describes a model's structure. The text that STEP files contain is written in an ASCII format that conforms to the STEP Application Protocols ISO 10303-2xx.",

      "STEP file is a widely used data exchange format for Computer-aided design (CAD). It was standardized in 1994 by the ISO committee under the name of “ISO 10303-21”. ISO 10303-21 defines the encoding mechanism for representing data in EXPRESS data modeling language. A STEP- file is also known as p21-File and STEP Physical File. The file extensions used for STEP-file are .stp and .step.",
      "A STEP file is a 3D model file formatted in STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Data), an ISO standard exchange format. It contains three-dimensional model data saved in a text format recognized by multiple computer-assisted design (CAD) programs."
