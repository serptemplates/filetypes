      "An RS~ file contains Rust source code similar to an .RS file, but developers use it during the development stage to signify to themselves and others that the source code is not ready to be compiled. Rust developers then remove the ~ from the .rs~ file extension when they are ready to compile the source code with the Rust rustc compiler to machine code to run as a program on the target platform."

      "You can also open and edit RS~ files with various source code and plain text editors, including Microsoft Visual Studio Code (cross-platform), Sublime Text (cross-platform), Microsoft Notepad (Windows), and Apple TextEdit (Mac). You may need to remove the ~ from the .rs~ file extension for the source code editor to identify the Rust programming language and provide coding features, such as syntax highlighting capabilities."
