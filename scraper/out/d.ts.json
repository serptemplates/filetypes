      "TypeScript is a JavaScript variant developed and maintained by Microsoft. It uses static type checking to check programs for errors before running them. When a TypeScript program is compiled, it is compiled to JavaScript, making it easier for web browsers to run.",
      "Developers creating TypeScript programs may want to access APIs written in plain JavaScript. To do so, the developer must create a D.TS file that declares that API's objects and functions. They can then add the API's .JS file as a source for their TypeScript program, alongside the corresponding D.TS file."
