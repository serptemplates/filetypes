      "ITLP files are simply folders that use the \".itlp\" extension. Therefore, you can create a new ITLP file by creating a folder and renaming it with the \".itlp\" extension. Finished ITLP bundles can include HTML, CSS, JavaScript, images, videos, music files, and other content.",
      "Apple provides a default template for iTunes LP developers. The template includes seven user screens which can be used to customize new albums: Home, Song List, Lyrics, Photos, Videos, Liner Notes, and Credits. Apple's TuneKit can also be used for customizing ITLP albums.",
      "NOTE: ITLP files were introduced with iTunes 9. They are stored in the same format as .ITE files."
