      "UUIDs are 128-bit numbers used to uniquely identify objects on a computer system. For each .THUMBNAILS folder located on an Android device, Android creates a DATABASE_UUID file. This file contains the last UUID assigned to that .THUMBNAILS folder.",
      "If Android discovers that the UUID a .THUMBNAILS folder's DATABASE_UUID file contains does not match the folder's current actual UUID (as determined by Android's DatabaseHelper), Android will automatically delete and regenerate all thumbnails the .THUMBNAILS folder manages. It will then create a new DATABASE_UUID file that contains the updated UUID."
