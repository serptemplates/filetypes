      "POTX files are saved in the Open XML standard format, which was introduced in Microsoft Office 2007. They replaced .POT files, which were saved in a binary format and used by PowerPoint 97 through 2003.",
      "POTX files come installed with PowerPoint allowing you to create presentations from professionally designed templates. You may also create your own custom templates to reproduce presentations specific to your needs. POTX files are commonly created by companies with a standard master slide, company logos, and company headers and footers."

      "A POTX file is a presentation template created by PowerPoint, a program that allows users to create slide show presentations. It contains default styles, text, layout, and formatting. POTX files are used to create multiple .PPTX files with the same formatting."

      "Several other presentation programs can open POTX files but they may not fully support the formatting of the template. Some options include Kingsoft Presentation (multiplatform), Apple Keynote (Mac), and Apache OpenOffice Impress (multiplatform). If you are a Mac user simply looking to view a POTX file, you can use Apple Preview, which comes bundled with macOS.",
      "You can also upload POTX files to Google Slides, which is a free web (and mobile) application that allows you to view, edit, save, and convert the presentations."
