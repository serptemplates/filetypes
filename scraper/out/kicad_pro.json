      "When you open a KICAD_PRO file in KiCad, the software loads the entire project, including its schematic diagrams (.KICAD_SCH files) and PCB layout (.KICAD_PCB files). The format enables engineers and hobbyists to work on all aspects of the design in one place, maintaining the project's organization and consistency.",
      "KiCad introduced the KICAD_PRO format in version 6.0, replacing the older .PRO project files used in earlier versions. The format is a more modern, human-readable file format based on structured data (using S-expressions), which makes it easier for KiCad to store more detailed project settings and remain consistent with its other file formats."

      "A KICAD_PRO file is a project created by KiCad (version 6 and later), an open-source electronic design automation (EDA) program used for creating printed circuit boards (PCBs). It contains project-level information, such as the project name, settings, and references to related schematic and PCB layout files. Electrical engineers, hardware designers, and electronics hobbyists who create or modify PCB designs with KiCad use KICAD_PRO files to organize all the files that belong to a single hardware design project."
