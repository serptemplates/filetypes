      "Commodore computing enthusiasts acquire actual Commodore 64 1571 floppy disks and save their data as a file in the D71 format. They can then load the D71 files in a Commodore emulator to run the game or program. Some users also upload the D71 files online to share them with other Commodore 64 enthusiasts.",
      "The D71 format supports data dumped from 1571 floppy disks, which may be one-sided like 1541 floppy disks (stored in the .D64 format), or double-sided. One-sided floppy disks typically store multiple 256-byte sectors in 35 tracks. Double-sided floppy disks store 70 tracks, resulting in a file doubled in size.",
      "D71 is one of several formats utilized to store Commodore 64 games or programs that computer enthusiasts load in emulators to run the game or program. Other formats created by Commodore 64 enthusiasts include D64, .G41, .T64, and .X64."
