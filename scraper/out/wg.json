      "David Given developed WordGrinder as a no-frills word processor for users focused on composing text, such as novelists and other writers. Besides its support for basic styles, it includes a spellchecker, undo and redo capabilities, and autosave functionality. Additionally, you can only navigate an open WG file in WordGrinder using arrow keys.",
      "You can create a WG file via WordGrinder's menu, which is accessible by typing the \"Escape\" key. You can then use the arrow keys to select File → New document set, modify the document, access the menu again and select File → Save document set. Additionally, you can select File → Save as template... if you want to save the document as a template WG file (same format as the document set)."

      "A WG file is a document set, which contains one or more documents created by WordGrinder, a simple word processor for composing text. Each document stores text encoded in UTF-8 and supports basic character and paragraph styles, such as bold, underlined, and italicized text and headings. WordGrinder also saves templates, which use the same format as document sets, as WG files."

      "You can open a WG file with WordGrinder (multiplatform). To open a WG file, type the \"Escape\" key and select File → Load document set.",
      "Since WG files store plain text, you can also open them with text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (macOS). While a text editor will not display the WG file natively, like WordGrinder, it still lets you view the text contents of the file. You might find this helpful when you cannot access WordGrinder but need to know the text in the WG document."
