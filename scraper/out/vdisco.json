      "A VDISCO file is a discovery file used by Microsoft Visual Studio in its Web Services. It provides information about the available Web Services such as their URLs, namespaces, and methods. VDISCO file is similar to the DISCO file format but is generated at runtime. It is stored in the Web service application and is used by the Visual Studio to dynamically discover and use Web Services in a project. VDISCO files are used in combination with the .asmx file that contains the actual Web Service code.\n\nYou can open VDISCO file in any text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, Github Atom, and Apple TextEdit. It can also be opened with Microsoft Visual Studio 2012 and later for working with it."
