    "description": [
      "A file with .gbr extension is a Gerber image file format for exchange of printed circuit board (PCB) design data transfer. It was developed by Ucamco. PCB design data is the main component required by the fabrication industry for handling. A GRB file contains PCB data such as copper layers, solder mask, legend, and drill and route data. It can be used to transfer data such as PCB fabrication characteristics including thickness or finish in a standardized format. All PCB design systems output Gerber files that can be handled by PCB fabrication systems. GBR files have now become the de facto standard for printed circuit board (PCB) design data transfer. Ucamco has provided a free online viewer to open and view GBR file formats.",
      "A GBR file contains printed circuit board (PCB) design data in Gerber format, which is an industry-standard file format supported by many PCB design systems. It contains instructions for drilling and milling the board and includes information about the board's electrical connections. GBR files are commonly used by PCB professionals to securely exchange image, drill, and rout data from design software to manufacturing machines."
