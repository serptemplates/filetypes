      "A file with .x extension refers to DirectX 3D Graphics legacy file format that was introduced with Microsoft DirectX 2.0. It was used for 3D graphics rendering in games and specifies the structures for meshes, textures, animations, and user-defined objects. It has been deprecated since 2014 as the Autodesk FBX file format serves better as a more modern format. X is template-driven and is free of any usage knowledge.\n\nYou can open DirectX X files using Microsoft DirectX and common text editors.",
      "3D image file used by DirectX technology, which is often used for rendering 3D graphics in games; may contain specifications for meshes, textures, animations, and objects; can be exported using the DirectX SDK plugins for 3ds Max and Maya, or with custom exporters for programs such as Blender and DeleD."
