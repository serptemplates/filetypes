      "JNX files are available through a BirdsEye subscription. They can support up to 5000 tiles per level but allow for fast rendering speeds. One drawback to the format is that it locks to a device meaning you cannot create a JNX file from another raster map. JNX files are still usable after your BirdsEye subscription has ended."

      "A JNX file is a raster map used by select Garmin devices, such as Alpha 100 and Montana 650, to assist users with navigating terrain. It contains a large raster map saved in a tile format that is divided into small rectangular pieces (tiles) for optimizing map rendering. JNX files also store the encrypted unit ID of the Garmin device it is created for."
