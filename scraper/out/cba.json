      "A Comic Book Archive (CBA) file, also known as Comic Book Archive or Comic Book Reader file, is a popular format used to store and distribute digital comic books. It typically contains collection of individual comic book pages or images bundled together in single file for easy organization and reading.\n\nOne of the common formats for creating Comic Book Archive files is the TAR (Tape Archive) format. TAR is a file archiving format used in Unix and Linux environments. It combines multiple files into single file often used for backup purposes.",
      "The Comic Book Archive (CBA) file format created using TAR archiver tool is typically in TAR format. TAR, short for Tape Archive, is a file archiving format commonly used in Unix and Linux systems. It is not specific to comic books but is a general-purpose archiving format.\n\nThe TAR format is straightforward way to bundle multiple files into single archive file. It does not provide compression by itself, so the resulting TAR file may be large in size compared to other compressed formats like ZIP or RAR. However, TAR files can be compressed using additional tools or combined with compression algorithms like gzip or bzip2 to reduce file size.\n\nThe TAR format preserves file structure, file permissions and timestamps of included files. It stores files sequentially within archive, allowing easy extraction of individual files or entire archive.",
      "Digital comic book compressed with ACE compression (.ACE files); contains a collection of images that represent pages in the comic book; used for distributing comic books and reading them with supporting e-readers."
