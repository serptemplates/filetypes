      "QuickDraw 3D was a 3D graphics API that Apple released in 1995. After the API failed to have much impact, the company stopped its development in 1998 and switched to using the more-standard OpenGL graphics API. Images created by programs that used the QuickDraw 3D API were sometimes saved with the .3dmf extension."

      "A 3DMF file is a 3D image created using the Apple QuickDraw 3D (QD3D) API. It contains a representation of an individual object or an entire 3D scene. 3DMF files could previously be opened in several 3D image-viewing and editing applications, but are now not widely supported."
