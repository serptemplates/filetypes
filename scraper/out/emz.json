      "Microsoft originally developed the Windows Metafile (.WMF) format in the 1990s to store vector graphics and bitmap data. Microsoft then replaced the WMF format with the Enhanced Windows Metafile (EMF) format, which is a 32-bit format that is device-independent.",
      "Microsoft developed the EMZ compression format to reduce the size of EMF files to save storage space and more easily transfer EMF graphics between applications, particularly Microsoft Visio and the Office suite, which includes Word and PowerPoint. While EMF files are common and various image editors may export them, EMZ files are much less common."

    "description": [
      "A file with .emz extension is a compressed container of Enhanced Metafile (EMF file). These are compressed using the GZIP compression technique which is the commonly used compression method on UNIX and LINUX operating systems. Unlink ZIP (/compression/zip/), GZIP compresses the archive as a whole instead of compressing individual files. EMZ files are smaller in size as compared to the EMF files and help in fast transfer during online file sharing. Some of the applications that can open EMZ files include Microsoft Visio 2019, Microsoft Office 2019, XnView MP, and File Viewer Plus.",
      "An EMZ file is an Enhanced Metafile (.EMF file) compressed with the .GZIP compression algorithm. It is compressed to reduce storage space and be more easily transferred between applications. EMZ files typically store vector graphics but may also store raster images."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open EMZ files in Microsoft Visio, Word, and PowerPoint in Windows by selecting the Insert tab, then clicking Pictures. You can also simply drag and drop the EMZ file into a document or presentation opened in the application.",
      "If you do not have access to the aforementioned Office applications, you can open EMZ files by decompressing them with a GZIP decompression utility such as GNU zip (gzip.exe), WinGZip, or PeaZip. You may need to rename the .emz file extension to .emf.gz to extract the EMF file with PeaZip. After decompressing the EMZ file, you can extract the EMF file contained in the EMZ file and open it with a program that supports the EMF format, such as XnViewMP (multiplatform), Adobe Illustrator, and OpenOffice Draw (multiplatform)."
