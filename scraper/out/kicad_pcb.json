      "KiCad uses KICAD_PCB files as the main working file for the PCB layout stage of a project. Users typically create these files after designing a schematic in KiCad's schematic editor and generating a netlist. Designers then open the KICAD_PCB file in the PCB Editor to place components, route connections, and verify the design using KiCad's built-in design rule checks. Once finalized, users can export the file to standard manufacturing formats, such as Gerber and drill files, for fabrication.",
      "KiCad introduced the KICAD_PCB format in version 4.0, replacing the older .BRD format used in previous versions of the software. KICAD_PCB files are saved in a human-readable, text-based format that uses S-expressions, which makes it easier for version control systems to track changes and for users to edit the file manually if necessary."

      "A KICAD_PCB file is a printed circuit board (PCB) layout file created by KiCad, an open-source software suite used to design electronic schematics and circuit boards. It stores all of the information required to manufacture or simulate a PCB, including the physical layout of components, copper traces, pads, drill holes, and board outline. KICAD_PCB files also contain metadata, such as netlists, design rules, and layer information."
