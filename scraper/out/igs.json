      "IGES is a standard for transferring three-dimensional models between CAD programs. You will most likely encounter an IGS file only if you work with CAD software in a field that involves manufacturing, such as the automotive or aerospace industries.",
      "The Integrated Computer-Aided Manufacturing (ICAM) United States Air Force department developed the IGES format in 1980. Many CAD programs subsequently adopted it, and it became a standard. However, in the mid-1990s, the STEP (.STP) format replaced the IGES format, and the usage of IGS files eventually declined.",
      "NOTE: IGS files may also be saved with the .iges file extension (.IGES files)."

  "more_information": {
    "description": [
      "An IGS file is a graphics file saved in a 2D/3D vector format based on the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES), a standard ASCII text-based format. It stores wireframe models, surface or solid object representations, circuit diagrams, and other objects. Many CAD applications save and export vector data as IGS files."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open IGS files with various desktop CAD programs, such as Autodesk Fusion 360 (Windows), Dassault Systemes CATIA (multiplatform), Nemetschek VectorWorks (multiplatform), and CADEX CAD Exchanger (macOS). You can also open and view IGS files with online viewers by uploading them to CADEX CAD Exchanger Cloud or ShareCAD.org.",
      "Since IGS files store plain text information, you can open them with a text editor (you may need to change the .igs file extension to .txt). However, when viewing the files with a text editor, the contents will appear as text instead of a visual representation of a model, like when you view them with CAD software. You can use text editors, such as Microsoft Wordpad (bundled with Windows) or Apple TextEdit (bundled with macOS), to view the plain text in IGS files."

  "how_to_convert": {
    "instructions": [
