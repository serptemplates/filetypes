      "The different architectures in APPXBUNDLE files allow the appropriate version of the app to be deployed to a matching computer's architecture. For example, a 32-bit system may receive the x86 version of the app while a 64-bit system receives the x64 version. By including multiple architectures into an APPXBUNDLE file, developers can support a wide range of devices with a single installer package.",
