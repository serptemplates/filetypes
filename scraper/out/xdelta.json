      "In 1997, developer Joshua MacDonald released the first version of xdelta. Xdelta allows users to input two files and create an XDELTA file, which maps the differences between the input files.",
      "This can be useful if, for example, a user wants to create a patch file that contains the modifications they've made to a commonly-used file. To create their patch file, the user can enter the original file and their modified file in xdelta. Xdelta will then produce an XDELTA file that maps the files' differences.",
      "Other users can then use the XDELTA file (and xdelta) to transform their copy of the common file into a copy of the modified file. This is one way that video game modders distribute and install mods, since distributing only the modifications they've made to a game allows modders to circumvent restrictions on copying and distributing copyrighted game material."
