It is used as a starting point to develop multiple pages that have the basic settings defined already in the template. New HTML pages can be built using copies of these templates and changing the content where necessary, while keeping the common sections unchanged. The non-editable regions of these templates such as header, footer, and menu remain the same across all the webpages.",
