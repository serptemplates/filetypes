      "Blender is a free, multiplatform application for creating various 3D productions, including models and animations. When saving the 3D image or animation you created in Blender, the application generates a BLEND file to store its contents. After saving the BLEND file, you can close the file, then re-open it for further editing.",
      "Unlike many other types of project files, BLEND files contain all the objects, sounds, images, effects, scenes, and other assets included in a Blender project. If you want to share a Blender project with another user, you need only provide them with that project's BLEND file, not any of the assets you imported into the project.",
      "NOTE: BLEND files are saved in a proprietary binary format to keep them from growing to an unmanageable size."

      "A blend file is a file format utilized by Blender, a widely-used 3D modeling and animation software. It is the default file format used by Blender to save and store all the data related to a 3D scene, including 3D models, materials, textures, animations, and more..\n\nThe blend file format is a binary file which organizes and stores data in the form of hierarchical structures. These hierarchical structures contain information about the objects and their properties in a 3D scene. The relationship between the 3D scene are also stored in these files. All this information is used by Blender to render the scene in real-time. The blend file also contains information that can be used by Blender to export it to other file formats, such as Collada, FBX, OBJ etc.\n\nBlend files offer several benefits because they enable users to save all the data related to a project in one place, simplifying the process of collaborating or sharing with others. They are also relatively small in size and their compact size enhances their portability and convenience in storage and transfer.",
      "A BLEND file is a 3D image or animation project created with Blender, an open-source 3D modeling program. It contains 3D mesh data, lighting information, vertex painting, animation keyframes, NURBS objects, procedural textures, UV mapping layout, and real-time interactivity data. BLEND files may store multiple scenes in a single file."

      "You can open BLEND file by launching Blender and then clicking on the “File” menu and selecting “Open” from dropdown menu. Alternatively, you can simply drag and drop the blend file into Blender software and it will open the blend file.",
      "You can open a BLEND file with Blender (cross-platform). To do so, select File → Open... from the program's menu bar. Then, navigate to and open your BLEND file. The 3D image or animation your BLEND file contains will appear in Blender."
