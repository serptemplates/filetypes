      "A file with .rhtml extension is a server side HTML file that contains Ruby code or scripts. The code is executed on the server using the Ruby on Rails running at the backend. For those who don’t know about Ruby on Rails, it is a full-stack framework for developing web applications with backend databases based on the Model-View-Control pattern.
