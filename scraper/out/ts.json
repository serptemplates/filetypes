      "You will most likely encounter TS files on DVDs. For example, when viewing video files burned onto a DVD, you may find a sequence of TS files named moviename1.ts, moviename2.ts, moviename3.ts, and so on.",
      "TS files were common during the height of DVDs in the 1990s and 2000s. However, as technology and multimedia formats (.M2TS, .MP4, etc.) have progressed, the TS format has become more obscure."

      "A TS file is a translation file generated with the lupdate software utility that comes bundled with the Digia’s Qt SDK. The SDK is available for Windows, Mac and Linux Operating Systems. TS file contains phrases in one language and their translations into another language. The translations stored inside a TS file are specific to a particular application. TS files can be opened with the Digia Qt SDK.",
      "A TS file is a video file saved in the Video Transport Stream (TS) format, which stores video data compressed with standard MPEG-2 (.MPEG) video compression. The TS format is often used to save video on a DVD disc but may also store streamed or broadcast video. Many video players can play and convert TS files to other formats, including VideoLAN VLC media player and Corel VideoStudio."
