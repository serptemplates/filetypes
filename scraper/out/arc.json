      "ARC is a lossless data compression and archival format developed by System Enhancement Associates (SEA). The file format and the application that creates it both are called ARC. ARC was very popular during the early days of the dial-up BBS as it combined the features of compression and archiving multiple files in the same file. ARC was later replaced by ZIP that offered better compression ratios.\n\nThe .arc file extension is used by several other non-related archive file types like the ARC format used by the Internet Archive to store multiple web resources, a different ARC format used by FreeArc archiver, a different format used by Nintendo for resources, etc.",
      "An ARC file is a backup file created by Norton software products, such as Norton 360 and Norton Online Backup. It contains a backup of computer files created automatically by the software, which may include personal user files as well as system files. Since ARC files can include all personal and system files, they may be very large in size."
