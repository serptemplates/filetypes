      "A VIR file is any type of file that has been infected with a computer virus and has been renamed by an antivirus software program, such as Symantec's Norton AntiVirus or Avira AntiVir. The \".vir\" extension is typically appended to the filename (i.e. program.exe → program.exe.vir) to indicate the file is a virus and to prevent it from being executed."
