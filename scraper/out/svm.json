      "OpenOffice and LibreOffice are open source Microsoft Office equivalents that allow users to create text documents, presentations, spreadsheets, and images. Both suites' Draw programs allow users to create vector images and save those images as SVM files. Users can then add SVM images to their documents, presentations, or spreadsheets.",
      "The SVM file format is similar to the .WMF (Windows Metafile) format that Windows previously used. Some SVM files included in LibreOffice's sample documents may not use the .svm extension, but they can be identified by opening the file and locating SVM files' unique VCLMTF signature."
