      "PRDX files are saved in a proprietary format and are the main file type associated with Presentations, a slide presentation program similar to Microsoft PowerPoint, which is included with Microsoft Office. PRDX files are used similarly to how .PPTX files are used by Microsoft PowerPoint.",
      "Presentations users typically save presentations as PRDX files but there are several other formats available. They can be saved as .PRV or PRVX templates for repeated use, .RTF files as a text outline, or PowerPoint .PPT, PPTX, or .PPSX files. They may also be exported to various other formats, such as .PDF, .HTML, .PNG, .JPG, .TIF, .BMP, .WMV, or .MP4.",
      "NOTE: PRDX files replaced PRD files, which were used to store presentations by older versions of Presentations."
