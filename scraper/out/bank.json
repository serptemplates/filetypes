      "FMOD Studio replaced FMOD Designer, which used .FSB files to store audio banks. FSB files were created with .FEV files, which contained the audio event metadata used by the game program code to trigger sounds when the game is being played."

      "A BANK file is an audio file created by FMOD Studio, a DAW-like program used to create adaptive music and sounds for video games. It contains a collection of compressed audio files, typically .WAV files, which may be used for music or sounds, such as footsteps, ambient noises, or weapon fire. BANK files also store audio event metadata referenced by the program to trigger the audio during gameplay."
