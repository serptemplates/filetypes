      "A PZZ file is a compressed scene file generated using Poser, a software for designing and animating 3D figures. It contains data like 3D figures, props, lighting settings, camera angles, and motion sequences stored within it. Poser is a 3D computer graphics program that allows users to create and animate 3D characters and scenes. Poser typically uses its own file formats to save scenes and content. These file formats can be used to save a variety of information related to a 3D scene, including the 3D models, textures, lighting, camera settings, and animation data.",
