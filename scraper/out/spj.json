      "PhotoStage SPJ project files are only supported by PhotoStage software, which is used for creating personal slideshows and sharing them with family and friends. You can open SPJ projects in PhotoStage by selecting File → Open.",
      "If you want to share a project with someone who does not own PhotoStage, you can burn the project to a DVD, upload it to YouTube, Vimeo, or Flick, or export it in another file format. Some multimedia formats you can export the project to include .MP4, .MOV, and .AVI.",
      "If you are moving an SPJ project to another computer or backing it up, you need to also copy the actual media files imported to the project since they are referenced in the project. If you select File → Back Up Project Files To Folder..., you can copy all the referenced files to a single location for backup or transfer."

      "An SPJ file is a project file created by NCH PhotoStage slideshow software. It contains a sequenced multimedia presentation that may include text, shapes, pictures, video clips, music, narration, effects, and transitions. SPJ files store references to imported media files, such as audio, video, and images, but it does not store the files themselves."
