      "A file with .mpkg extension is an archive installer file, mostly found on MacOS Operating Systems. It contains all required installation files of the application without the need to keep associated files separately. A single MPKG file can contain package files PKG as one of the installation files in addition to other files. MPKG files can not be opened with any general software and are executed automatically on MacOS using Apple Installer.",
      "An MPKG file is a macOS meta-package. It contains multiple macOS packages (.PKG files), which are used to install applications. Bundling related PKG files within an MPKG file makes those packages easier to distribute and install as a group."
