      "SCC files are video files created by ScreenFlow, a Mac OS X desktop screen recording application. It stores the captured video in a proprietary format and may also include audio captured from a computer microphone or from computer’s sound card.\n\nSCC files are used by ScreenFlow as temporary files to store unrendered video data before it is exported to final video format, during editing process in ScreenFlow, when you make changes to your video, apply effects or perform other edits, the software saves project progress in SCC files which contain raw video data and editing instructions.\n\nOnce you have completed the editing process and are ready to export your video, ScreenFlow renders the SCC files into desired output format, such as MP4 or MOV. The rendering process involves applying all the edits and effects to generate the final video file.\n\nAfter rendering process is complete, temporary SCC files are typically deleted and final video file is saved with chosen output format which can be share, upload or use as needed.",
      "ScreenFlow from Telestream, Inc. is a screencasting and video editing software for the macOS operating system. It can capture the audio and video from the computer, edit the captured video, add highlights or annotation, and output a number of different file types such as AIFF, GIF, M4V, MOV, and MP4.\n\nAfter capturing your screen, ScreenFlow provides a comprehensive video editing interface, you can trim and split video clips, add transitions and animations, insert text and captions, and incorporate additional media files like images, music, or other videos, also offers built-in audio editing tools to adjust volume levels, remove background noise, and apply effects.",
