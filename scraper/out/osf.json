      "An OSF file is a Zip-compressed package for distributing backups, maps, and plugins for OsmAnd, a GPS navigation application for Android and iOS devices. For example, OsmAnd users often share plugins, which consist of .JSON files and folders with other resource files, as OSF files that other users can import into the app to extend its functionality."

      "Since OSF files are renamed ZIP files, you can decompress the archive to view the contents of the OSF file. For example, rename the .osf file extension to .zip, then decompress the archive with a Zip utility. You can then extract the files and folders in the archive."
