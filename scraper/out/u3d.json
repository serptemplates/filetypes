      "A U3D file contains a sequence of blocks. There are 3 different types of a block in each U3D file.\n\nFile Header BlockDeclaration BlockContinuation Block\n\nThe loader determines the end of a block if the data in that block is not required or if a decoder for that block type is not available.",
      "In the early 2000s, many companies concerned with the ability to share 3D models among applications, including Adobe Systems, Boeing, Intel, and HP, joined together to form the 3D Industry Forum. This Forum produced the U3D file format, in which can be saved 3D data of all kinds. The Forum also produced an open-source library that developers can use to allow their applications to read and open U3D files.",
      "In August 2005, the standards organization Ecma International officially recognized the U3D file format, in the ECMA-363 standard. Ecma International has since updated the U3D format three times. The organization released the fourth and most recent version of the U3D format in June 2007.",
      "You may encounter U3D files on their own or embedded within .PDF files. Many applications, such as Adobe Acrobat Pro, Dassault Systemes SolidWorks, Autodesk Inventor, and Kubotek KeyCreator, allow users to export U3D files within PDF files, to make the files easier for others to open and view."

      "U3D (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as ECMA-363 standard in August 2005. 3D PDF documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards).\n\nU3D format was developed keeping in view the aim to establish a universal standard for three-dimensional data storage and exchange. However, the format finds its main utilization in encoding for 3D PDF rather than being used as an interchange format. Acrobat 3D converts a supported 3D file type to either U3D or PRC upon conversion into the PDF.",
      "A U3D file is a 3D model saved in the Universal 3D file format. Each U3D file contains information about the shapes, textures, lighting, shading, and motion data that comprise a model. The 3D Industry Forum created the U3D file format in December 2004; Ecma International standardized the format in August 2005."
