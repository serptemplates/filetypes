      "In Quaver, players press buttons in time to music to complete levels. The game includes an Editor that allows players to create their own levels. Levels consist of an MP3 file and one or more associated QUA files, known as beatmaps, that determine when notes appear on-screen. Each QUA file stores data for a different difficulty and can be edited separately in the Quaver Editor.",
      "When a player exports a level from the Editor, it is saved as a QP file, also known as a Quaver mapset. Each QP file contains all of a level's QUA files, as well as its MP3 file. Players often export QP files from Quaver or upload them to QuaverGame.com to share the levels they've made with other players."
