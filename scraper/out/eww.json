      "Most Embedded Workbench users are more familiar with EWP project files than EWW files because projects are created and modified more frequently. Workspaces allow users to open multiple projects in the same space. Each project open in a workspace is shown in the Workspace window.",

      "An EWW file contains a workspace created by IAR Embedded Workbench, a user-friendly IDE, which includes a C/C++ compiler, a C-SPY debugger, and project management tools. It stores information about one or more projects (EWP files) and their files, which may include .H and .C files. EWW files also include workspace settings."
