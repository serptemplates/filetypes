      "An EQP file is a preferences file used by Design Science MathType, a program for creating and editing mathematical equations. It contains settings specified by a user that configure how MathType operates, such as fonts, equation formatting, and layout preferences. MathType users save their preferences in the software as EQP files to preserve a working environment they have customized to reflect their needs and preferences, which they can open again to reload."

      "You can open EQP files with Design Science MathType in Windows and macOS (Mojave 10.4 and earlier). To open an EQP file, select Preferences → Equation Preferences → Load from File.",
      "Since EQP files are saved in plain text, you can also open them with a text editor. Some common options include Microsoft Notepad (Windows), Apple TextEdit (macOS), and gedit (Linux).",
      "When opened in a text editor, you can modify the properties of the EQP file. However, incorrectly modifying the EQP file may corrupt it."
