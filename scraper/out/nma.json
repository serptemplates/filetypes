      "The NMEA format is used by many Marine GPS devices to transmit data from marine electronics to computers and other marine equipment. NMEA data can be transmitted through various types of interfaces, including USB, Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, UHF, and RS-232. NMEA stores data in sentence structure, with each first word, known as the data type, defining the interpretation of the rest of the sentence.",
      "The NMA file can be opened by a variety of GPS programs, such as GPSBabel. You can also import the NMA files to .KML files with the NMEA to KML converter online."
