      "AbiWord is a word processor developed by members of the AbiSource community. The program features standard word-processing features, such as spell check and support for tables and various document formats, including .DOCX, .DOC, .WPD, and .ODT. Additionally, AbiSource only actively develops the Linux version (since version 3) of AbiWord, while older versions of the application are also available for Windows and macOS.",
      "In some cases, ABW documents may grow large, taking up storage space on a machine or making it difficult to transfer. To reduce the size of an ABW document, AbiWord allows you to compress it with gzip compression (select File → Save As).",
      "NOTE: Various versions of AbiWord may also compress ABW files with Bzip2 compression, resulting in a .BZABW file."
