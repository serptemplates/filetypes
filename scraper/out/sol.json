      "A SOL file contains user-specific data and settings used by Macromedia Flash Player 6 and later versions, including Adobe Flash Player. It is similar to a website cookie but used specifically to store Flash Player-related data. For example, when a person plays a Flash-based game in a web browser, their game save information is often stored in a SOL file."
