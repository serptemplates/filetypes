      "Adobe Creative Cloud and Adobe Application Manager use PIMX files to install Adobe packages, which are saved in PIMA files. PIMA files can contain Adobe applications, extensions, configuration information, archives, and other files. PIMA files are stored on and retrieved from Adobe's servers, so you are unlikely to encounter a PIMA file on your PC.",
      "If you want to learn more about PIMA files, you can do so by opening one of the PIMX files found on your PC. Most PIMX files reference a PIMA file, in the section of the file that begins with pimaInfo. Each pimaInfo section includes a PIMA file's name, package type, and file size. Most PIMA packages are Zip-compressed files."
