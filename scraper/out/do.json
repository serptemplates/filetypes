      "In the Struts framework, the .do extension is a URL mapping scheme for a web application and not a file extension. For example, Struts often uses the .do string for mapping Java servlet actions to a Struts servlet (typically in the web.xml configuration file).",
      "Additionally, DO files downloaded from a web browser are typically data files, most often .PDF files, such as bank statements or other documents. Some webinar programs may also generate DO files formatted as .VCS files. Changing the file extension to the correct extension (.vcs in this case) may allow you to import the files into programs that support the VCS format."

      "A DO file is a Java servlet file that is used by web servers for delivering web-based Java applications. It is commonly associated with the Struts controller of applications that processes files. This allows DO files generate dynamic webpages that contain visual appearance as well as data retrieved from databases. Java servlets sends these dynamically generated web application pages to requesting browser for display.",
      "A DO file is a web-based Java program (servlet) run by a web server that supports Java, such as Apache Tomcat or IBM WebSphere. It is typically mapped to the Struts controller, which processes the file. DO files are used for generating dynamic webpages, which include data retrieved from databases."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You will likely not encounter a DO file since web servers that support Java, such as Apache Tomcat or IBM WebSphere, handle DO files on the server side.",
      "However, you may download a file via a web browser where the web server mistakenly applies the .do extension. For example, if a web server configuration or media type is incorrect, the server may send you a .do file when you download your bank statement instead of the actual PDF bank statement file. In this case, to open the file, rename the extension to .pdf, then open it with a program that supports PDF files, such as Adobe Reader."

      "If a web browser erroneously applies the .do extension to a file you have downloaded, you can change the extension to the correct one and then open it with the appropriate app that supports the file type. For example, if the browser applies the .do extension to a .CSV file, you can change the extension to .csv and then open it with an application that supports CSV files."
