      "MSCZ is the standard save format for MuseScore. When you save a score with MuseScore by selecting File → Save, the program creates an MSCZ file to store the score contents. Once saved, you can close MSCZ files, and then re-open them to continue editing them.",

      "The .mscz file format is the proprietary and default project file for MuseScore, the widely-used open-source music notation software. As the core file type for this powerful application, MuseScore relies on the .mscz extension to save and store musical compositions in their entirety. This comprehensive container holds every detail of a score, encapsulating all musical notations, symbols, and layout settings for a specific piece. Within a single .mscz file, you’ll find everything from the fundamental notes and rhythms to critical expressive markings like dynamics, tempo, key signatures, and a wide array of other essential musical elements, providing a complete digital representation of a composition.\n\nBy saving composition in .mscz format, you can preserve the entire structure and layout of music piece, making it possible to open and edit the composition in MuseScore or other software that supports this file format.",
      "The .mscz file format used by MuseScore is a binary file format. It is not human-readable and is designed to store various elements of musical composition in a structured and efficient manner.\n\nThe specific details of .mscz file format are proprietary to MuseScore and exact internal structure and organization of the file may change between different versions of MuseScore. This means that only MuseScore and other compatible software can reliably interpret and work with .mscz files.",
      "An MSCZ file is a compressed music score created by MuseScore, a free program for music composition and notation. It stores several files, including .MSCX and .JSON files, in the MuseScore Compressed Score (MSCZ) format (uses Zip compression), that store instruments, time and key signatures, and music notes that comprise the composition. MSCZ files also contain audio settings, the score style, and other metadata."
