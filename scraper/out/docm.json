      "Macros are a series of inputs and commands a user has grouped together so they can easily execute a repetitive or complex task, such as formatting a document, entering data, or performing calculations. In Microsoft Word, users can record a macro by selecting View → Macros → Record Macro. After assigning the macro to a Quick Access button or keyboard shortcut, users can click the button or press the shortcut keys to execute that macro.",
      "If a user who has utilized macros to create a Word document wants to retain those macros when they re-open or share the document, they must save the document as a DOCM file. DOCM files are saved using the same Open XML-based format used by DOCX files, but DOCM files can store macros used to create a document, while DOCX files cannot. When you open an unfamiliar DOCM file in Microsoft Word, the program will typically ask whether you want to enable macros."

      "A DOCM file is a document created by Microsoft Word, a popular word processor included with Microsoft 365. It contains embedded macros that can be executed within the document. DOCM files are used to automate repetitive or complex Word doc (.DOCX) tasks using macro functionality."
