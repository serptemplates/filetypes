      "3D artists typically use Blockbench to create and edit 3D models featured in video games, including Minecraft. The BBMODEL file is the primary file type associated with Blockbench.",

      "A BBMODEL file is a project created by Blockbench, an open-source 3D model editor. It contains JSON-like plain text information about a 3D model and may include one or more .PNG or .TGA textures. Blockbench users save projects as BBMODEL files when creating and modifying 3D models for people, creatures, animals, and objects."
