      "As mentioned, an FZPZ file is an archive file that contains multiples files for representation of a part used in printed circuit board. The FZPZ contains the following files:\n\nFour SVG files - that represent part’s breadboard, schematic, PCB and icon imagesFZP file - An XML file that contains information about the part’s properties, connectors, and buses\n\nThe files are usually named as follow.\n\npart.file.fzpsvg.breadboard.file.svgsvg.icon.file.svgsvg.pbc.file.svgsvg.schematic.file.svg",
      "Fritzing is a printed circuit board (PCB) design application that allows Arduino and PCB enthusiasts to create PCB layouts. The circuits these layouts describe contain a variety or parts, which are represented by images in Fritzing.",
      "However, Fritzing parts, or FZPZ files, are actually archives made up of five constituent files. They contain four SVG images, which serve as the part's breadboard, schematic, PCB, and icon images, and an FZP file, which is an XML file that describes the part's properties, connectors, and buses. While Fritzing parts are saved using the .fzpz file extension, they are standard Zip archives, meaning you can decompress them with any Zip decompression utility if needed. You may have to change the file's extension to .zip before you can decompress it.",
      "To export a Fritzing part as an FZPZ file, right-click the part in your Fritzing parts bin and select Export Part."

      "An FZPZ file is a component/part used in an electronic circuit design created with the circuit prototyping and design application Fritzing. It is a compressed archive that contains an FZP file and four SVG images describing the overall part in Fritzing. The advantage of using these files is that users can share their FZPZ files with each from reusability point of view. The sharing of FZPZ parts help in integrating circuit parts to create larger PCB designs in a quick manner.",
      "An FZPZ file is a part used in an electronic circuit design created by Fritzing, a circuit prototyping and design application. It is a compressed archive that contains an .FZP file and four .SVG images, which are used to show the part in Fritzing. Fritzing users often share FZPZ files with each other, allowing them to import and use others' parts in their own circuits."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open FZPZ files and use them as parts in Fritzing (cross-platform). To do so, select File → Open from Fritzing's menu bar, and then navigate to and open your FZPZ file. The part your FZPZ file describes will then appear in your My Parts bin."
