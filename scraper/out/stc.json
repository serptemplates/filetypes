      "A file with .stc extension is a connection file used by Adobe Contribute software to store the connection information. It contains connection information such as username, host url, protocols such as FTP, SFTP, etc. for reuse from within the existing website. For those who don’t know, Adobe Contribute used to be a specialized HTML editor that was used to push updates to existing websites including content based articles known as blogs. It included plugins for popular web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox that seamlessly contributed content to websites from within the pages. It has been discontinued since January 2017 and Adobe Dreamweaver is used now for creating websites from scratch.",
