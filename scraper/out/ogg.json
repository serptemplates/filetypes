      "The Ogg container format is a multimedia format that supports multiple streams of video, audio, text, and metadata. The individual streams may be compressed with different compression methods, including Theora (video), Vorbis (audio), Opus (audio), FLAC (audio), and OggPCM (audio).",
      "Before 2007, OGG files were used to store various types of media, but since then the Xiph.Org Foundation recommends that OGG files store only audio data. Now, you will most likely encounter only OGG files that store audio data compressed with Vorbis compression.",
      "However, OGG files can also use other types of audio compression, including FLAC and Speex. These files cannot officially be referred to as Vorbis files, since they use a different compression scheme. Also, they are typically saved as .OGA files."
