      "In FileMaker Pro, “.fpt” files are used to store memo comments or textual information associated with a database. These memo comments provide a way to describe the contents of the database using raw text. This is especially useful when you want to provide additional context or details about the database that might not fit within the standard database fields, which often have character limits.\n\nFPT files in FileMaker Pro are used to store memo comments that provide descriptive textual information about a database. This allows users to provide context and details beyond what can be accommodated by the standard database fields with character limitations.",
      "Database file created by FileMaker Pro, a relational database program; contains textual information representing a \"memo;\" used to describe a database with raw text instead of using a standard database field, which typically is limited to fewer numbers of characters."
