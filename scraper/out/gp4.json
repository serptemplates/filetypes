      "Arobas Music Guitar Pro is a multitrack guitar composition and accompaniment program. It includes tab editing tools and enables you to convert tabs to several audio and document formats.",
      "Each version of Guitar Pro saves tabs as a file type corresponding with the software version. For example, Guitar Pro 4 saves tabs as GP4 files and Guitar Pro 3 saves tabs as .GP3 files. Although Guitar Pro replaces file types with each new version, the software still supports previous Guitar Pro file types.",
      "NOTE: Arobas Music originally developed Guitar Pro as a tablature editor for Windows. However, it expanded the software to Mac OS X in July 2006."
