      "Both versions of Tropical Freeze use particle systems saved as GPSYS files. Online, you may also see these files referred to as GENP files. This is because some of Tropical Freeze's content logs use the GENP abbreviation when referencing generic particle system files. However, no generic particle system files use the GENP extension."
