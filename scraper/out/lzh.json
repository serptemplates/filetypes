      "LZH is derived from the Lempel–Ziv–Storer–Szymanski (LZSS) compression scheme developed in the 1980s, but it features extended compression using dynamic Huffman coding. The LZH acronym comes from the names of the inventors Lempel-Ziv and Haruyasu.",
      "LZH compression is most commonly used in Japan but is supported by a variety of compression and decompression utilities, such as Corel WinZip, WinRAR, and 7-Zip. You are most likely to encounter LZH files if you use a compression utility that supports the format and compress your files with the LZH scheme. However, you may also receive an LZH archive from a co-worker or friend via email or cloud storage space that is looking to share one or more large files."

      "A file with .lzh and .lha extension usually relates to archive compression file format. This file format is the same as other file compression formats like ZIP, RAR, etc. The main purpose of these file formats is to reduce the size of the format for easily sending as well as to keep them together in compressed form. AS compare to other western companies LZH files are very popular in Japan and usually used for compressing video game data. The LZH add-on for Windows 7 is built into the Japanese version of Windows 7. Microsoft first released the Microsoft Compressed (LZH) Folder Add-on for the Japanese version of Windows XP. This file format is implemented with compression provisions and features used by the Lempel-Ziv and Haruyasu algorithm",
      "An LZH file is an archive compressed using Lempel-Ziv and Haruyasu (LZH) compression algorithm. It contains one or more files that have been compressed to reduce their file size for the purpose of saving storage space and transporting them to another location. LZH archives are similar to LHARC compressed archive (.LHA) archives."
