      "The Locky virus is hazardous malware that people commonly refer to as ransomware. The purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator (by way of Bitcoin) to unlock your files.",

The virus then generates \"_HOWDO_text.bmp,\" \"_HOWDO_text.html,\" and \"_[2_digit_number]_HOWDO_text.html\" files that contain instructions informing you of the takeover and what you need to do to recover your files."

It contains a user's file, such as a .WMV or .PDF file, encrypted with RSA algorithm and AES-256 encryption. ODIN files became prevalent in 2016 and are similar to .LOCKY files."
