      "A file with .tgz extension is a TAR archive file, comprising of multiple files and folders, that has been compressed using the Gnu Zip (gzip) compression software. A TAR file usually combines multiple files into a single file for backup or distribution over the internet. It is uncompress file until it is compressed using the gzip software after which it becomes the TGZ file. TGZ files, being compressed files, take less space on disc and are easily transferrable using internet via email. Some applications that can open TGZ files include WinZip, Apple Archive Utility, 7-Zip, and WinRAR. TGZ files are mostly used in UNIX and Linux system.",
      "A TGZ file is a Unix .TAR archive compressed with Gnu Zip (.GZIP) compression to reduce the file size. It is commonly used on Unix and Linux systems and was originally created as the shorthand version of the compound extension .TAR.GZ."
