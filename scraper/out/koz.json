      "Bell Cellular (now known as Bell Mobility) is the wireless communications division of Bell Canada. In the early 2000s, Bell Canada partnered with Groove Mobile to allow users to purchase and download full-track music from an online store. These songs, which could be purchased from a PC and transferred to or downloaded on a phone, were saved as KOZ files."
