      "Developers and content creators across various industries, such as education, marketing, software deployment, and technical documentation, may utilize AutoPlay Media Studio and AUTOPLAY files to create simple, self-contained applications without needing extensive programming knowledge. Once an AUTOPLAY project is complete, a user can export it as a standalone executable or burn it to a CD/DVD for distribution.",
      "AUTOPLAY files contain settings such as window size, page arrangement, scripting logic, and references to multimedia files used in the project. The actual media files (images, videos, audio, .BTN buttons, etc.) are typically stored in a folder named CD_Root, which is saved in the same directory as the AUTOPLAY project file. This structure keeps all project components organized and portable.",
      "NOTE: Version 8 of AutoPlay Media Studio introduced the AUTOPLAY project format. Previous versions were saved as .AM7, .AM6, etc., files with the number related to the version of the software saving the project."

      "An AUTOPLAY file is a project created by Indigo Rose AutoPlay Media Studio, a Windows-based software tool for creating interactive applications such as CD/DVD menus, multimedia presentations, training programs, and lightweight games. It contains the core project data in XML format, including the application's interface layout and the actions or events that occur when a user interacts with different elements of the application. AUTOPLAY files store references to multimedia files used in the project; they do not contain the actual media files."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open AUTOPLAY files with Indigo Rose AutoPlay Media Studio in Windows. To open an AUTOPLAY file, select File → Open.",
      "Since AUTOPLAY files are saved in XML format, you can also open them with a plain text or XML editor. However, opening an AUTOPLAY file in this manner will not appear the same as if opening it with AutoPlay Media Studio."

  "how_to_convert": {
    "instructions": [
      "AutoPlay Media Studio (version 8 and later) can convert AUTOPLAY files to Autoplay Media Studio Exported Project (.APZ) files and Autoplay Media Studio Template (.APT) files. The software can also build AUTOPLAY files as Windows Executable (.EXE) files and Disk Image (.ISO) files."
