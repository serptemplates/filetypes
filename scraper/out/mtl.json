      "MTL file, short for Material Template Library, is companion file format used in 3D computer graphics and modeling. It is often associated with Wavefront OBJ file format, which is common format for storing 3D models and their associated materials and textures.",
      "An MTL file is a material settings file used by 3D object editing applications, such as Adobe Photoshop and Autodesk Maya. It is stored alongside an .OBJ file and describes how a program should apply textures to that object. MTL files contain the names of the texture bitmap files to apply to an object as well as the 3D coordinates at which to apply them."
