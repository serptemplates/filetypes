      "A SEAM file is a configuration file used by the JBOS Seam framework. It contains metadata/reference to a server-side servlet that processes requests to the web application. It also contains metadata about Seam components such as the names of classes and methods that implement the components. You can use SEAM files in conjunction with JavaServer Faces (JSF) framework for building dynamic and interactive web applications. SEAM files are usually stored in the WEB-INF directory of a Seam application.",
      "File used by Java Web applications supported by the JBoss Seam Framework; stores a reference to a backend servlet, which processes requests to the Web application; used for serving pages to the user through a Web browser; often used with the JavaServer Facelets technology."
