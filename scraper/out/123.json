      "Lotus 1-2-3 was first developed by Lotus Development Corporation, which was bought by IBM in 1995 and integrated into part of IBM Lotus SmartSuite. The \"1-2-3\" refers to the program's three main capabilities: 1) spreadsheet functions, 2) creating charts and graphs, and 3) basic database operations.",
      "The 123 file format is a proprietary format introduced with the release of the 97 Edition of Lotus 1-2-3 in 1997. The format replaced the .WK4 format introduced with version 4 of Lotus 1-2-3."

      "A 123 file is a spreadsheet created by Lotus 1-2-3, or exported by another spreadsheet program, such as Corel Quattro Pro. It stores data in rows and columns and supports functions that can be applied to the data in various cells, which can automatically populate the data in other cells. 123 files may contain various spreadsheets, such as financial budgets and quarterly earnings."
