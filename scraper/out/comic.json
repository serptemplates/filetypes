      "Comic Life allows you to add text, images, and shapes to make your story come alive. The program provides a variety of tools for designing the layout of your document and applying various effects and filters to the different document elements. When you save a comic in Comic Life 2 or earlier, the program creates the COMIC file and stores the project information in the file. When you are finished with your work you can export the document to a variety of formats, such as .PDF, .JPG, .GIF, and .PNG.",
      "NOTE: COMIC files were replaced by .CL2DOC files in Comic Life 2 and .COMICDOC files in Comic Life 3. If you are using version 2 or earlier, it is important to note that the COMIC format is not supported by version 3 or later of Comic Life. If you have a COMIC file and want to open it in Comic Life version 3 or later you can save it as a .COMICDOC file. You must first download version 1 or 2 of Comic Life, then open the COMIC file. Next, save the comic strip as a COMICDOC file (or a CL2DOC file if you have Comic Life 2). You can then open the COMICDOC or CL2DOC file in version 3 of Comic Life."
