      "InstallShield Express was a simplified version of the full InstallShield tool. Developers used IWZ files in older versions of InstallShield Express from the early 2000s to organize and save the setup process for their software so they could compile it into an installer. Modern versions of InstallShield no longer use IWZ files, making them obscure."
