      "XEM file is XML metadata interchange file that can be used to export metadata information about PowerDesigner model to external file. XEM file includes information about the model including entities, relationships, keys, diagrams and other relevant metadata. The file can be used to transfer or share model with other users or systems or to create a backup of the model for safekeeping.\n\nTo export PowerDesigner model to .xem file, you can go to File menu and select “Export” and then “XML Metadata Interchange”. You can then select specific elements of model that you want to export and save resulting .xem file to desired location.\n\nSimilarly, you can import .xem file into PowerDesigner model by selecting “Import” from the File menu and then choosing “XML Metadata Interchange” option. You can then select .xem file to import and choose specific elements to import into your model.\n\nThe .xem file format is a useful feature of PowerDesigner that enables users to share and transfer metadata information between different systems or users.",
