      "In some cases, ENC files may be encoded using a standard encoding format. For example, some ENC files are encoded using standard uuencode (.UUE) encoding. You can decode standardly-encoded ENC files with any program that supports the format in which they are encoded.",
      "However, most ENC files are encoded using proprietary encoding formats. Only the program that created and/or uses these ENC files can decode them and read the data they contain."

      "An ENC file could also represent a musical composition crafted using Passport Music Software’s Encore, a scorewriting application compatible with both Windows and macOS platforms; within this file, you will discover a rich tapestry of musical notation, encompassing elements like notes, measures, time signatures and key signatures. Additionally, the file encapsulates essential details such as score’s title and information about composer who brought musical piece to life.",
      "An ENC file is a generic data file that stores encoded information, saved in one of many proprietary or standard formats. Typically, ENC files are encoded to prevent users from modifying the data they contain or using them in an unauthorized manner. However, some ENC files are encoded to optimize them for a particular use, such as transfer over the internet."

      "If your ENC file is encoded using a standard encoding format, you can decode it with a program that supports that encoding format.",
      "If your ENC file is encoded using a proprietary encoding format, you may be able to open it with the program that created it. However, many ENC files are not meant to be opened by users. Instead, they contain encoded data that a program loads as needed."
