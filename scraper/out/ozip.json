      "OPPO is a Chinese electronics company that produces smartphones, media players, and other devices. OPPO's smartphones include the F series, A series, Find series, N series, R series, K series, and Reno series.",
      "Firmware updates for OPPO smartphones are saved and delivered as OZIP files. These files' names typically begin with the model number of the phone the file is meant to be installed on. For example, the file RMX1831EX_11_OTA_0050_ALL_RUWJ5JZDQA95.OZIP is meant to be installed on a Realme U1 phone."

      "An OZIP file is a firmware update file used by an OPPO smartphone. It is an encrypted compressed archive that contains update data. OZIP files are typically automatically distributed to and installed on OPPO phones, but those who have rooted their phones may want to manually download and install the updates an OZIP file contains."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can use oppo_ozip_decrypt (cross-platform) or ozip2zip (Windows) to decrypt your OZIP file and transform it into a .ZIP archive. You can then view the file's contents as you would any Zip archive and use a ROM flashing program, such as Team Win TWRP (Android), to flash the firmware updates your file contains to your OPPO smartphone. TWRP also allows users to directly install OZIP files on their phones."
