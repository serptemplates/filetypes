      "Before being purchased by Microsoft in 1999, Entropic Research Laboratories published several programs used to analyze and manipulate human speech signals. These programs included the Entropic Signal Processing System (ESPS), the WAVES+ display program, and the Hidden Markov Model Toolkit (HTK), a speech recognition research toolkit.",
      "Entropic's speech analysis programs use audio files saved in various proprietary file formats. Entropic initially created the ESPS format for use with the Entropic Signal Processing System. However, WAVES+ and HTK also support the ESPS format. Eventually, Entropic replaced the ESPS format with the Esignal format.",
      "NOTE: While WAVES+ and ESPS are discontinued, Cambridge University continues to maintain and distribute HTK."
