      "systemd organizes everything it manages into \"units,\" and a SERVICE file is a type of \"unit\" file. The .service extension tells systemd that the file describes a service, and other unit files may use different extensions, such as .socket for sockets or .target for target groups. System administrators and software packages use SERVICE files to control system services consistently across distributions that use systemd.",

      "A SERVICE file is a configuration file used by systemd, the init system included with many Linux distributions. It contains instructions for starting, stopping, restarting, and reloading the service, as well as information about when the service should start automatically (for example, at boot). SERVICE files define how systemd should manage a specific service or background process."

      "You can open and view SERVICE files with any text editor since they are plain text, but you should only edit them when necessary. Most users manage services using systemd commands such as systemctl start, systemctl stop, and systemctl status rather than modifying the files directly.",
      "If you need to change a service's behavior, do not edit the original file in /​lib/​systemd/​system/​. Instead, copy the file to /​etc/​systemd/​system/​, make your changes there, and run systemctl daemon-reload to apply them. This process preserves your customizations during system updates and package upgrades."
