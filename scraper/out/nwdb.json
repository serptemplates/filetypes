      "You most likely will only see the NWDB file if you search the Neat Data folder in your Documents folder. There should be at least three files in the Neat Data folder: a Neatworks NWDB file, an image NWDB file, and a cabinet NWCAB file.",
      "If you come across an error message indicating that you cannot open a Neat database, it most likely means that a file in your database is corrupt, locked by another program, or missing. You should check that all three files are in the Neat Data folder. If one of the three files is missing then it causes the error message.",
      "NOTE: An NWDB file is actually a SQL Server Compact Edition (SQLCE) database but instead of the .sdf file extension, it has the .nwdb file extension. Therefore, any programs that can open .SDF SQL Server Compact Database files can also open NWDB files."

      "The NWDB file format is known as the Neat Database File and is associated with Neat 5 which is a digital document management application designed to organize scanned documents, receipts, and contacts. An NWDB file is created when user scans documents using Neat software. It contains images of these scanned documents along with metadata which helps in organizing and retrieving the files.\n\nEven though it uses the .nwdb extension, an NWDB file is fundamentally a SQL Server Compact Edition (SQLCE) database. It means that any application capable of opening .sdf files can also access .nwdb files.\n\nThe default name for NWDB file is ImageDB1.nwdb. If multiple NWDB files are created they are sequentially named (e.g., ImageDB2.nwdb, ImageDB3.nwdb, etc.).\n\nNWDB files are generally found in the Neat Data folder that is located within the user’s Documents folder. This folder normally contains at least three important files:\n\nThe Neatworks NWDB file which is the main database fileThe Image NWDB file which contains actual scanned imagesAnd the Cabinet NWCAB file which is used for managing the database structure.\n\nIf you come across an error when trying to open an NWDB file, it may point out that a file in your database is missing or corrupted or that the database is locked by another program. To avoid these issues, make sure all necessary files are present in the Neat Data folder.",
      "An NWDB file is a database file created by Neat 5, a digital document organizer. It contains one or more images of scanned documents, contacts, or receipts. NWDB files are automatically created when you scan a document."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "To open an .nwdb file created by Neat 5, you need to use the Neat software directly. Here’s how you can do that:\n\nInstall Neat software\n\nMake sure that you have Neat 5 installed on your computer. If you don’t have it, you can download it from the Neat website.\n\nLocate Neat Data folder\n\nThe .nwdb files are generally stored in Neat Data folder situated within your Documents folder. The path may resemble something like this:\n\nC:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\Documents\\Neat Data\n\nLaunch Neat 5\n\nOpen the Neat 5 application on your computer.\n\nImport NWDB file\n\nIf the application doesn’t automatically identify and open .nwdb file\n\nLook for option to import files. This might be under File menu or an import button.Navigate to the Neat Data folder and choose .nwdb file you want to open.\n\nCheck for Associated Files\n\nMake sure that all associated files are present in Neat Data folder. An NWDB file often depends on other files (like image files and cabinet files) to work properly. If any of these are missing, it might cause errors when trying to open the database.\n\nOpen the Application\n\nOnce you import the file, you should be able to access and manage your scanned documents and metadata within the Neat interface."
