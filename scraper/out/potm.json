      "The average PowerPoint user will likely never come across a POTM file because it saves templates with more functionality than a typical user needs. For example, it supports macros, which are script-like functions that automate repetitive tasks.",
      "You can record macros in PowerPoint that can be replayed to complete a task and assign them to a button in PowerPoint or keystroke, which allows you to conveniently run the series of steps. To record a macro, select View → Macros.",
      "If you are simply looking to create presentations, you can save them as .PPTX files, or as presentation template .POTX files. However, if you want to create a template that supports macros, you can save your presentation as a POTM file.",

      "A POTM file is a macro-enabled presentation template created by Microsoft PowerPoint, a program for creating slide show presentations. It contains default images, slide templates, macros, and formatting. PowerPoint users typically utilize POTM files to create multiple .PPTM files with the same design and macro settings."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open POTM files with Microsoft PowerPoint (2007 or later) in Windows and macOS. PowerPoint is the best option for opening POTM files because it fully supports the formatting of the presentations and the macros embedded in them.",
      "You can also open POTM files with other applications, but some of the formatting of the original presentations and macros may be lost. Other programs you can use to open POTM files include Apache OpenOffice Impress (multiplatform), Kingsoft Presentation (multiplatform), and Apple Keynote (Mac). If you are a Mac user simply looking to view a POTM file, you can use Apple Preview, which comes bundled with macOS, or upload it to Google Drive, which is a free cloud storage service.",
      "You can also upload POTM files online to Google Slides to open, edit, and convert the templates. Keep in mind that Slides does not support macros."
