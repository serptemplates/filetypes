      "Hewlett-Packard developed the HP-GL and introduced it in 1977 when it released the HP-9872 plotter. It soon became a standard for plotters to print vector images, most prominently CAD drawings, such as engineering designs and architectural blueprints. Because of its prominent use in CAD environments, many CAD software packages support the format.",

HPL files often store CAD designs sent to a plotter printer (which draws images using lines instead of dots) to print the image. HP-GL files are more commonly saved as .HPGL files."
