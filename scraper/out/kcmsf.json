      "In 2015, a security researcher discovered that KCNA's website served a malware file named FlashPlayer10.zip to visitors. The file was served via kcna.user.exploit.exploit.kcmsf, which was a KCMSF file that contained a JavaScript script.",
      "Most likely, KCMSF is the extension that KCNA uses for all its website's scripts. A website's scripts can use any file extension, as long as the extension is assigned and used appropriately. So, not all KCMSF files may contain malicious scripts. However, it is best to assume that they do."
