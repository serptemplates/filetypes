      "TeslaCrypt is a form of ransomware that infects users' computers using an Adobe Flash exploit. TeslaCrypt's creators produced several versions of the ransomware, which use different types of encryption and target different types of files. TeslaCrypt 3.0 primarily targets Word documents, PDFs, JPEG images, and game data files, encrypting them and appending them with the .micro, .xxx, or .ttt extensions.",
      "In May 2016, TeslaCrypt's creators shut down the ransomware and released master decryption keys for each version. BleepingComputer forum user BloodDolly added these keys to his TeslaDecoder decryption utility, allowing users to decrypt files encrypted by TeslaCrypt."

      "A file with the .micro extension is a file that has been renamed and encrypted by TeslaCrypt 3.0 ransomware. It could be a document, image, video game data, or other file. Typically, the .micro extension is added to the file's normal extension, resulting in a file with an extension like .docx.micro. You can decrypt .micro files for free using TeslaDecoder."
