      "Cytoscape is often used in biology, social science, and other research fields to explore relationships among large sets of data. Researchers and data analysts commonly use CYS files to share Cytoscape projects with collaborators or to archive analysis sessions for future reference.",
      "The CYS files make it possible to preserve both the structure of the data and the appearance of the visualization. By reopening a CYS file in Cytoscape, users can restore the session exactly as it was, including all open networks and analysis settings."

      "A CYS file is a session file created by Cytoscape, an open-source application used for visualizing and analyzing complex networks. It stores a complete Cytoscape session, including the loaded network data, visual layouts, applied styles, and any related metadata or annotations. CYS files enable users to save their entire Cytoscape workspace, allowing them to close the program and resume work later without losing progress."
