      "WinHKI is an obscure archive utility developed by Hanspeter Karl Imp. It allows users to compress and archive files in one of three different formats. These formats, referred to as HKI1, HKI2, and HKI3, are optimized for use with different types of files.",
      "The HKI1 format is optimized for compressing audio files, images, and videos. Notably, both the free and paid versions of WinHKI can create HKI1 files. (Only the paid version of WinHKI can create HKI2 and HKI3 files.)"
