      "An S02 file is the third part of a file that was split using ZipSplitter, a program used to split files to reduce their size for easier portability. It contains a segment of a larger file, such as a .ZIP or .MOV file, that is one part of several other parts. S02 files can be restored by ZipSplitter, along with the other parts (.S00, .S01, etc.) by double-clicking the .EXE file included with the split archive."
