      "Various utilities allow gamers to copy (or \"dump\") the game stored on an NES game cartridge to a single NES file. They can then use this file as a backup, if they lose their game cartridge or the cartridge's data becomes corrupt. They can also use the NES file to play the game in an NES emulator, which simulates the NES on a PC or mobile device.",
