      "DG Kernel is a software component utilized by software developers in various engineering industries. Developers can add the component to forms or dialogs in Windows applications they are developing to enable users to view, modify, and export 3D objects and scenes in various formats. While DG Kernel is typically added to builds of Windows applications by developers, it may also be utilized as a set of Windows .DLL files.",
      "The DG Kernel software saves MDG files internally, which means you will most likely not encounter the file type. Instead, DG Kernel enables you to export the MDG model to other 3D formats, such as .STEP, .DWG, and .STL.",
      "NOTE: DG Kernel was formerly named Digital Geometric Kernel. However, it was renamed to DG Kernel in December 2018 with the release of version 6.0."
