      "SNAPPY files may have a lower compression ratio than other compression programs, meaning that the files compressed by Snappy are larger in size than those created by other programs. However, the goal of Snappy is to be a fast compressor, not to achieve maximum compression. Therefore, while compressed files may be larger, they are compressed much more quickly.",
