      "The LH3D and LHZD files are used by Live Home 3D to save the contents of a design project. The files can store information for a variety of project types, such as a kitchen, bathroom, bedroom, office, living room, office, or house exterior. You can begin from scratch or from one of the Live Home 3D templates. You can also save a project as a template if you want to duplicate its properties for other similar projects. Templates are also saved with the \".lhzd\" extension.",
      "Live Home 3D allows you to export an LHZD file to other file formats, such as .PDF, .JPG, .BMP, .PNG, .TIFF, .SKP, .DAE, ZAE, .3DS, .FBX, .WRL, .X3D, RIB, .OBJ, .SCN, SCNZ, and USDZ. You can also share the project to YouTube, Facebook, Twitter, or Vimeo or send a project copy via Mail, Messages, or AirDrop directly from Live Home 3D."

      "An LHZD file is a compressed project created by Live Home 3D, a Windows 10, macOS, and iOS application used to design and visualize the interior and exterior of a home. It contains a project, which includes floor plans, building materials, lighting fixtures, appliances, and furniture. LHZD files are similar to .LH3D files but are compressed to make it more convenient to share between different platforms and store projects."
