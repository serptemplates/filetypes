      "WinAce was an archiving and encryption utility available for Windows. Primarily, it allowed users to package one or more files within compressed archives. By default, WinAce saved these archives in its proprietary ACE format.",
      "E-merge discontinued WinAce in the 2000s. The last version of the program is WinAce 2.69, which was released in 2007."

      "A file with .ace extension is an ACE compressed file format that was developed by Marcel Lemke. It is the primary file format used by the WinAce compression application which was developed and available for Microsoft Windows platform only. The format was developed as an alternative to the ZIP file format but with discontinuation of the WinAce, the format couldn’t be carried out for long.",
      "160-bit Blowfish encryption is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 160-bit key to encrypt data. It was designed by Bruce Schneier to be fast and secure, offering strong protection against unauthorized access. The algorithm operates in 64-bit blocks and supports variable key sizes, with 160-bit providing a high level of security. It’s commonly used in file compression and secure communication applications.",
      "WinAce is a file compression software for Windows that supports the ACE file format, offering high compression ratios and fast processing. It was known for creating and extracting ACE archives and supported other formats like ZIP and RAR. However, development of WinAce was discontinued, and it is no longer widely used today.",
      "An ACE file is a compressed archive created by E-merge WinAce, a discontinued archiving utility. It contains one or more files that have been packaged together for easier storage and sharing. While the ACE format is proprietary, several other archiving utilities can open ACE files."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "While E-merge WinAce is discontinued, it is still available online. Thus, you can still open ACE files (and extract the files they contain) with WinAce. Those who cannot or do not want to install WinAce can instead use PeaZip or The Unarchiver to open ACE files."
