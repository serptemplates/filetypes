      "Users in organizations that have deployed Dynamics AX to manage their operations, such as finance, supply chain, or human resources, are the primary users of AHD files. End users and business professionals rely on the help system to understand how to complete tasks, while developers and technical consultants may reference the same help data when configuring, customizing, or extending the software for business needs. The AHD file ensures that all users have quick access to relevant documentation directly within the application, without requiring an Internet connection."

      "An AHD file is a data file used by Microsoft Dynamics AX, an enterprise resource planning (ERP) program developed by Microsoft. It contains information that is displayed when users access the application's built-in online help system. Examples of information AHD files store include instructions, reference materials, and guidance related to features and processes within Dynamics AX."

When a user clicks Help inside the application, Dynamics AX retrieves the relevant information from the AHD files and shows it in the help window."
