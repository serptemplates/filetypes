      "Files with MHTML extension represent a web page archive format that can be created by a number of different applications. The format is known as archive format because it saves the web HTML code and associated resources in a single file. These resources include anything linked to the webpage such as images, applets, animations, audio files and so on. MHTML files can be opened in a variety of applications such as Internet Explorer and Microsoft Word. Microsoft Windows uses MHTML file format for recording scenarios of problems observed during the usage of any application on Windows that raises issues. The MHTML file format encodes the page contents similar to specifications defined in message/rfc822 which is plain text email related specifications. The actual specifications of the format are as detailed by RFC 2557.",
      "An MHTML file is an archive that contains all the contents of a webpage. It stores the HTML of the webpage, as well as linked resources in the webpage, which may include CSS, JavaScript, images, and audio files. MHTML files are primarily used by web developers to save the current state of a webpage for archival purposes."

      "You can open MHTML files with various web browsers, including Google Chrome and Microsoft Edge, whether you are online or offline. However, MHTML files saved in one web browser may appear differently when opened in another web browser because there is no standardized MHTML format utilized among all browsers.",
      "You can also use applications other than web browsers to open MHTML web archives. Some examples include Microsoft Word and Kingsoft Writer."
