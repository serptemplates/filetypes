      "HEIF, also known as H.265, is a digital photo storage format that saves images at a higher quality and in smaller-sized files than the .JPEG format. This reduces the amount of space photos take up on memory cards and mobile devices.",
      "In 2017, with the release of iOS 11, Apple made HEIF the default photo storage format for iOS devices. With this change, iPhones and iPads began saving users' photos as HEIC files. When Apple added HEIF support to iOS, they also added HEIF support to macOS, with the release of High Sierra.",
      "When you export or send a photo captured with an iOS device's Camera app to a non-iOS device or application, the photo is typically converted from an HEIC file to a JPEG or .JPG file. For example, when you upload an iPhone photo to Twitter or send it in an email, the photo is automatically converted to a JPEG.",
      "If you'd like your iOS device to automatically capture photos as JPEG files instead of HEIC files, you can do so by:",
      "Opening your iOS device's Settings app.",
      "Selecting Camera → Formats → Most Compatible.",

      "An HEIC file is a High-Efficiency Container Image file format that can store multiple images as a collection in a single file. The format was adopted by Apple as variant of the HEIF with the launch of iOS 11. It was adopted as the default file format for storing images in compressed form on mobile devices. HEIC, like HEIF, are compressed using the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard and are smaller in size without compromising the quality.",
      "An HEIC file contains one or more images saved in the High Efficiency Image Format (HEIF), a file format most commonly used to store photos on iOS devices. It stores an image or sequence of images likely created by an iPhone or iPad's Camera app, as well as metadata describing each image. HEIC files are most commonly saved with the .heic extension but may also be saved as .HEIF files."

In previous versions of Windows 11, and in Windows 10, you must install Microsoft's HEIF Image Extensions and HEVC Video Extensions packages before you can open HEIC files. There is a small charge for the HEVC Video Extensions package.",
