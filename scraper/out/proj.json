      "When a developer creates an application in Visual Studio, they start by creating a new project and associated project file. The project file contains all the information MSBuild needs to build the developer's project. While specific types of applications typically use specific types of Visual Studio project files (for example, C# applications typically use .CSPROJ project files), some user-created project files may use the generic .proj extension.",

For example, the PROJ file may contain settings that tell MSBuild to build an application differently when targeting different operating systems. Some of the elements PROJ files contain include:",

      "A PROJ file is a project file created in Microsoft Visual Studio, a software development tool used to create Windows programs and web applications. It contains XML-formatted text that defines a project's content, platform requirements, versioning information, and web server or database server settings. MSBuild (the Microsoft Build Engine) uses PROJ files to build developers' projects, transforming the projects into executable programs."
