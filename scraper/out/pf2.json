      "The PF2 format was developed in the late-2000s as an alternative to the BDF and PCF font formats. The format primarily improves upon the inefficient storage and multiple format variations of the BDF and PCF formats.",
      "PF2 files contain the font name, font family name, font weight, font slant, font point size. The files also store the maximum character pixel width and height and the pixel distance from the baseline of the font to the top and bottom of characters (ascent and descent)."
