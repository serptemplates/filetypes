      "Photo! 3D Album allows you to choose a design template and add your JPEG photos to frames within that gallery design. After importing your photos you can preview them in the gallery and choose to fit, crop, or rotate them in the frame. After previewing them, you can save the gallery as a PGAL file, which allows you to reopen the gallery at a later time for editing or viewing purposes. You can save PGAL galleries locally on your computer, burn them to a CD/DVD, or upload them to a website.",
