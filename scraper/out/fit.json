      "Garmin Activity FIT files are similar in structure to the general FIT format but have several distinctions. For example, they are generated specifically by Garmin devices (e.g., GPS watches, fitness trackers, and bike computers). Also, the data in a Garmin FIT file may include Garmin-specific data extensions (e.g., proprietary metrics) that other platforms do not fully support.",
      "Additionally, the Garmin Activity FIT format is similar to the .TCX format, but offers a more efficient and compact storage solution, allowing for faster data processing and reduced file sizes. This makes it a better choice for athletes who want to keep detailed records of their activities and track their progress across multiple devices and platforms."

      "A FIT file is a GIS data saved in a Garmin-specific version of the Flexible and Interoperable Data Transfer (FIT) format used by Garmin GPS sport devices and Garmin software. It contains various information such as location, time, and other performance metrics, including speed, elevation, heart rate, and cadence. FIT files are typically logged during athletic events like runs, bike races, or other types of workouts to record and store fitness activity data."
