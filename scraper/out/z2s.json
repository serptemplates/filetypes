In the game you can choose the type of zoo to create and build animal exhibits, restaurants, bathrooms, and other facilities to be successful. As you progress through the game you unlock new features such as exotic animals and newer facilities. The Z2S file allows you to save all of your progress so you do not have to start from the beginning every time you play."
