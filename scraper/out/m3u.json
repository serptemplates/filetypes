      "M3U playlists can be used to play media stored on your computer or stream media over the Internet. Playlists used to play local files include file paths that point to those files. Playlists used to stream media include URLs that point to that media.",
      "The M3U format was originally designed to describe audio playlists, comprised of .MP3, .WAV, and other audio files. However, the format is now commonly used to save video playlists, comprised of .MP4, .TS, and .WEBM files. Note that M3U files do not contain the media itself. Instead, they contain information used to open and play media files.",
      "NOTE: M3U is short for MP3 URL, which is itself short for Moving Picture Experts Group Audio Layer 3 Uniform Resource Locator.",
      "Many media players that can create playlists can save those playlists as M3U files. For example, you can create an M3U playlist in VideoLAN VLC media player by loading a queue of media files, selecting Media → Save Playlist to File or File → Save Playlist..., and saving the playlist in the M3U format."

      "M3U (MP3 URL) is an audio playlist file stored with the .m3u extension. M3U is not an actual audio file, it just points to audio and sometimes video files. M3U was developed to be used with Winplay3 software by Fraunhofer. It is also supported by various media players and software.",
      "An M3U file is a media playlist that can be opened in various media players, including VideoLAN VLC media player, Nullsoft Winamp, and Microsoft Windows Media Player. It contains plain text that states where the media files the playlist includes are located. It also includes metadata describing attributes of the referenced files (such as their author and title)."

If the playlist your M3U file describes does not begin playing when you open it, it may be because you do not have access to the files included in the playlist.",

      "For example, if your M3U file references a series of MP3 files, you must locate or download the MP3 files. Then, you can use Audacity or VideoLAN VLC media player to convert them to other audio formats."
