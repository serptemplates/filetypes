      "ECMAScript 6 (ES6) introduced the specification for ES Modules, providing a standard for implementing modules in JavaScript. As of 2018, all major web browsers support ES Modules.",
      "However, the popularity of modularized JavaScript pre-dates ES6. Node.js, a JavaScript runtime environment, used CommonJS as the specification for modules. Because so many existing applications were built with CommonJS, when Node.js added support for native ES modules, it controversially introduced the MJS file extension to differentiate the two and prevent applications from breaking.",

      "A file with .mjs extension is a JavaScript source code file that is used as an ECMA Module (ECMAScript Module) in Node.js applications. Node.js’s natvie module system is CommonJS that is used to split the code in different files to keep the JS code organized. MJS is the only way used by Node.js to identify if the module is a CommonJS or an ES6. ECMAScript modules are standard formta for packaging JavaScript code for reuse. MJS files can be opened in text editors such as Atom, Vim, Apple xCode, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Notepad.",
      "An MJS file is a source code file containing an ES Module (ECMAScript Module) for use with a Node.js application. MJS files are written in JavaScript, and may also use the .JS extension outside of the Node.js context. ES Modules allow web and application developers to organize code into smaller reusable components."
