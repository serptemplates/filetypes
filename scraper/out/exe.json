      "In Windows, you can run the program an EXE file contains by double-clicking the file. However, do not double-click the file unless you can verify its legitimacy.",
      "Advanced users can also extract an EXE file's contents without running the program it contains, using archive expansion tools like 7-Zip or RARLAB WinRAR.",
      "The EXE file format is designed specifically for use with Windows. Non-Windows operating systems (OS), such as macOS and Linux, cannot natively run programs saved as EXE files. However, macOS, Linux, and other non-Windows users can run Windows programs on their PCs by creating a Windows virtual machine.",
      "In macOS, you can use a Windows virtual machine created by Parallels Desktop or VMware Fusion to run the program an EXE file contains. You can also install Windows on a Mac with the Boot Camp utility bundled with the OS.",
      "In Linux, you can use a Windows virtual machine created by Oracle VM VirtualBox to run the program an EXE file contains. You can also use Wine, an application designed specifically to allow users to run Windows applications without installing Windows.",
      "In Android, you can use the Android version of Wine to run Windows applications. However, Wine for Android is limited by Android devices' architecture, and it can run only some Windows programs. In iOS, you can use the iOS version of Turing Software UTM to run Windows applications."
