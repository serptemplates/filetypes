      "HSACO files are not meant to be opened or modified by users. Instead, they contain binary data that the GPU executes directly.",
      "However, developers and engineers, typically working within the AMD ROCm ecosystem, can analyze the contents of HSACO files using specialized tools. Programs, such as the AMDGPU Disassembler, Radeon GPU Analyzer, and ROCm Development Tools, allow users to inspect the compiled code, verify performance characteristics, and debug GPU kernels."
