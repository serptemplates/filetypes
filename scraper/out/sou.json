      "SOU files act as containers for raw sound data used in music compositions and sound effects. The files are similar to .PAC files, which SBStudio also uses, but SOU files store only audio data, not additional project information.",
      "Musicians and hobbyists used SOU files to build instrument samples and arrange tracks within SBStudio II's modular music environment. Because SBStudio II is an older program, SOU files are now primarily found in archived projects or collections of legacy audio tools."

      "A SOU file is an audio file created by SBStudio II, a sound editing and music sequencing program for DOS. It stores audio data in a block-based format that SBStudio uses to organize and play back sampled sounds. SOU files are proprietary to SBStudio and are not meant to be played directly in standard media players."
