      "BCP (Bulk Copy Format) is Microsoft SQL Server’s technical data format that defines data structures to store different database data type values for import/export. The format fully defines the interpretation of each data column so that the set of values specified in the data file could be read. The BCP utility uses the BCP file format to read data from such a file and identify it.",
