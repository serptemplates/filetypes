  "summary": "An image file format is a standard method for organizing and storing images on devices like computers, tablets and smartphones. Digital images store image data in 2-dimensional grid of pixels where each pixel is a representation of colour in terms of number of bits. Image file types are classified into vector image formats and raster image formats. 3D Images are another type of vector image file format that is used for managing 3D images.",

      "MATLAB is an advanced application that provides various tools to analyze data, develop algorithms, create models, build apps, and more. In MATLAB, a figure is data visualized as a plot, such as a histogram or pie graph, output from mathematical data. Additionally, the figure function creates a figure (window), which allows you to insert plots and graphs.",
