      "The images that GRY files contain are not camera raw files. In this case, raw refers not to the fact that an image is unprocessed (like a camera raw image), but the fact that the image's data is unstructured (it contains no header or footer, is uncompressed, and does not use a color palette). Because GRY files contain raw image data, many programs cannot display the images they contain unless you provide accompanying metadata."

      "A GRY file is a grayscale raster image. It is saved in a raw bitmap format, which may vary from file to file. Because GRY files' exact file format can vary, and because GRY files are quite uncommon, most image viewers and editors cannot open them."
