      "LaTeX is a typesetting system commonly utilized in academia to prepare documents with content that is formatted separately before it is published. This system is beneficial for publishing documents in fields such as engineering, economics, mathematics, statistics, philosophy, and linguistics.",
      "Unlike word processor documents, which contain inline text formatting, LaTeX documents contain plain text with tags and other LaTeX syntax. The visual formatting is handled by a LaTeX processing system. Therefore, a LaTeX document may look different depending on which LaTeX application is used to display the file.",
