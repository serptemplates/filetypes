      "A TIB file is a disk image created by Acronis True Image. It contains an exact copy of a computer's hard disk, allowing the complete hard disk to be restored in the event of a system crash. TIB files might be a single backup or one of many incremental backups."

      "If your TIB file was created by Acronis True Image 2017 or a later version or Acronis Backup 12.5, you may encounter an error message when attempting to delete the TIB file via Windows Explorer. The error is produced because Acronis's Self-protection feature does not allow users to delete TIB files outside Acronis True Image or Backup.",
