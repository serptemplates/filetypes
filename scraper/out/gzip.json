      "In 1992, Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler created the gzip utility and file format for use with Unix systems. gzip was packaged with GNU, a collection of free software, and intended to replace previous Unix file compression programs. gzip proved useful enough that is still used today, primarily by Linux and other Unix-like users.",
      "Most commonly, archives created using gzip are saved as .GZ files. However, in rare cases, gzip archives may use the .gzip extension.",

    "description": [
      "A GZIP file is a compressed archive that is created with the standard gzip (GNU zip) compression algorithm. The compressed archive may contain multiple files including compressed files, directories and file stubs. Most of the Unix systems include the open source gzip (GNU Zip) compressor utility for compression/decompression of files. GZIP files can be opened with applications such as WinZip.",
      "A GZIP file is an archive compressed using GNU zip (gzip) compression. It typically contains a single file, which has been compressed for easier storage and sharing. In many cases, this single file is a .TAR archive (which itself contains several files)."

    "instructions": [
      "GZIP files use the .gz file extension and can be opened using:\n\nBuilt-in UNIX/Linux utilities (gzip, gunzip)Windows applications like WinZip, 7-Zip, and WinRARmacOS tools such as The Unarchiver\n\nTo extract a GZIP file in Linux or macOS, use:\n\ngunzip filename.gz\n\nFor multi-file archives (tar.gz or .tgz files), use:\n\ntar -xvzf filename.tar.gz",
      "You can open a GZIP file with 7-Zip (Windows), Apple Archive Utility (Mac), B1 Free Archiver (multiplatform), and many other archiving utilities. Before doing so, you may have to change your GZIP file's extension to .gz."
