      "PAQ is a \"data compression archiver\" available for Windows and Linux. Developer Matt Mahoney released the first version of PAQ in 2002. Mahoney released the sixth version of PAQ, better known as PAQ6, in 2004.",
      "Notably, PAQ6 allows users to specify the amount of memory needed to compress and decompress an archive. The more memory used, the higher the archive's compression ratio (and the slower the archive is compressed/decompressed)."
