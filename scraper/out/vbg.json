      "Visual Basic 6.0 was a standard option for building Windows applications before Microsoft replaced it with the .NET Framework in 2002. Additionally, Visual Basic (specifically VB.NET in the modern Visual Studio environment) no longer uses VBG files.",
      "In the current VB.NET and Visual Studio environment, project organization and source control management are handled differently using Solution (.SLN) files, which organize and manage multiple projects. Additionally, source control in Visual Studio is now typically managed through modern tools like Git or Azure DevOps rather than the outdated Microsoft Visual SourceSafe system (a version control system officially discontinued in 2005 that also supported VBG files)."

      "A VBG file contains references to multiple Visual Basic Project (.VBP) files, acting as a container that older versions of Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0 used to manage project files within a single group. It links together different Visual Basic projects to organize them, making it easier for developers to work on large applications consisting of several smaller, individual projects."

      "You can open VBG files with Microsoft Visual Basic 6.0. However, Microsoft no longer develops the software.",
      "Since VBG files store plain text, you can open them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (bundled with Windows), Apple TextEdit (bundled with macOS), and gedit (Linux). However, opening the files with a text editor will not appear the same as opening them with Visual Basic."
