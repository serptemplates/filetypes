      "Many programs are associated with these files on Windows and Mac OS. Many programs can be used to tackle these files. It is an encoded audio format for Commodore Amiga. The features like attack, section repeat, and release are supported by these files. These features are used to store samples of musical instruments. The lossy data compression of Fibonacci-delta is available that results in the compression ratio of 50% and decrease the fidelity.\n\nHere is an example of an audio-only 8SVX IFF audio file:",

      "Developed by Electronic Arts, the 8SVX file format is a digital audio standard specifically for Amiga computers, functioning as a dedicated data subtype of the broader IFF container format. It stores 8-bit audio samples within distinct data chunks, while separate descriptor chunks contain all the crucial metadata about the audio stream. While Amiga computer systems are now rarely in active use, the primary modern application of 8SVX files is the preservation and playback of classic video game music and retro audio samples from that era.",
