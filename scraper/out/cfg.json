Then open the program and check the directory to see if a new CFG file has been created. Also, a CFG file can sometimes be moved or deleted to revert to a program's default settings.",

      "A CFG file is a generic preference file that stores settings and configuration information. It is used by various programs, which means different CFG files may store data in different formats. CFG files typically should not be opened manually but may be saved in a text format that can be viewed in a text editor."
