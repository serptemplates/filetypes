      "EasyBeadPatterns is a free program that beaders can use to mock up beading patterns and determine what beads they need to reproduce a pattern in real life. When beaders save an EasyBead pattern, it is saved as a PTNX file. The PTNX file's text specifies the pattern's stitch and size, as well as the locations at which different-colored beads are placed. Each bead's color is identified by a bead ID, and its location is specified by the row and col settings.",
      "After opening a PTNX file in EasyBeadPattern, beaders can convert the file to a JPG or PDF that can be opened in any image- or PDF-viewing application. Beaders can also print patterns directly from EasyBeadPattern, to use them as physical beading guides."
