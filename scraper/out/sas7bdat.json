      "SAS is a statistical software suite that data analysts use to manage and analyze data. It allows analysts to create statistical models, perform multivariate analysis, graph and present data, and engage in predictive analytics.",
      "In SAS version 7, the suite began saving users' datasets as SAS7BDAT files. These files are binary database files that contain a header and data pages. The header lists the database's ID, name, contents, and other metadata. The data pages contain subheaders that include additional metadata and the packed binary data that represents the database's dataset.",
      "NOTE: SAS7BDAT files created on different platforms use slightly different file formats. However, you can use any SAS7BDAT file with any platform's version of SAS."

For example, to access a SAS7BDAT file located at C:/​Documents/​example.sas7bdat, you would enter libname examplerefname C:/Documents/example.sas7bdat in your SAS session. You could then access the dataset by referring to it as examplerefname. For more detailed instructions, refer to SAS's official documentation."
