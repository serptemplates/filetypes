      "Scatter ransomware, also known as [email protected] ransomware, is a trojan horse that you may have downloaded via a spam email attachment. After you open the attachment, the ransomware executes a process named either Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Scatter or Trojan-Ransom.BAT.Scatter. These processes encrypt your files and append them with the .good, .crypt, or .pzdc extension.",
      "After encrypting your files, Scatter ransomware produces a ransom note that contains instructions you are supposed to follow to pay a ransom and unlock your files. However, you do not need to pay a ransom to unlock your files. Instead, you can use Kaspersky ScatterDecryptor tool to decrypt your files for free. (Also, FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files.)"

      "A file with the .good extension has been encrypted and renamed by Scatter ransomware. It could be an encrypted document, video, image, or other type of file. Because the file is encrypted, you cannot open it. The .good extension is added to the file's normal extension, producing an extension like .mp4.good."
