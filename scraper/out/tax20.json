      "A TAX20 file is a tax return created by the desktop version of Intuit TurboTax 2020, a U.S. tax preparation and filing application. It stores personal information entered by the user, a 2020 federal IRS tax form, and one or more 2020 state tax forms. TAX20 files are the same as the more common .TAX2020 files, but are instead saved with the .tax20 file extension."
