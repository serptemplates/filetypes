For example, after purchasing LightWave 3D online, NewTek displays instructions to download LightWave 3D and provides a LICENSE.LWK file to register the application to your computer."

      "An LWK file is a license key used by NewTek LightWave 3D, a professional 3D rendering application. It stores a unique string of characters tied to a user's purchase, enabling the user to activate a legal copy of the software. NewTek introduced the LWK file type when it released version 11 of LightWave 3D, replacing .KEY files."

      "LWK files are not meant to be opened. Instead, you can place the LWK file in the \"licenses\" folder in the LightWave 3D installation directory to register the software, and the LightWave 3D (11.0.3 or later) software references it.",
      "For example, to register the trial version of LightWave 3D 2020, place the LWK file in the following directory (depending on your operating system):",
      "Windows - C:\\​Users\\​[USERNAME]\\​.NewTek\\​LightWave\\​2020.0.3\\​licenses",
      "macOS - [USERNAME]/​Library/​Application Support/​NewTek/​LightWave/​2020.0.3/​licenses",
      "While LightWave 3D references LWK files, you can still open them with a plain text editor to view the license key."
