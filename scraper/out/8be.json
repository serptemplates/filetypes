      "Before Mac OS 9, both Windows and Mac versions of Photoshop used 8BE files. However, beginning with Mac OS X 10.0 Cheetah in 2001, versions of Photoshop for Mac use .PLUGIN packages instead of 8BE files.",
      "Photoshop plugins add various features to enhance its functionality, such as image filters, effects, or export options not included in the standard version of the software. Examples of plugin files supported by older Photoshop versions include .8BF files for image filters and .8BI files for supporting additional file types.",
      "NOTE: PhotoDeluxe also supports 8BE plugins. However, Adobe discontinued the software in 2002, replacing it with Photoshop Elements, which does not support the format."

      "An 8BE file is an export plugin that extends the capabilities of the Windows version of Adobe Photoshop, a popular image-editing application. It contains information that adds export capabilities to the software, including settings for exporting .PSD images to web-optimized .JPG and .PNG images (Save for Web.8be). Users can add plugins to the app by placing the 8BE files in the designated Plug-ins folder within the main Photoshop application folder."
