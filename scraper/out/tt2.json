However, since the TT2 file stores data for a TrueType Font TTF file you can rename the .tt2 file extension to .ttf, then open it with a program that supports TTF files, such as FontForge (multiplatform) or Apple Font Book (Mac). Or you can simply delete the TT2 file since it contains duplicated data from a TTF file."
