      "OCIMF files are typically created when a user downloads HVPQ information in an OCIMF file from SIRE or when a user exports HVPQ information from the desktop OCIMF Particulars Editor in an OCIMF file to be uploaded to SIRE. Both SIRE and OCIMF Particulars Editor can open OCIMF files.",
      "SIRE was originally launched in 1993 by the Oil Companies International Marine Forum (OCIMF) to improve shipping standards in the tanking industry. It is an online database that allows ship owners to submit information about vessels that can be accessed by other parties, such as government bodies, terminal operators, and charterers.",

      "An OCIMF file is a vessel record file used by SIRE, a ship inspection report program used to assess the safety of vessels. It contains information about a vessel gathered from a Harmonised Vessel Particulars Questionnaire (HVPQ) submitted by ship owners. OCIMF files include various vessel information, such as the name, IMO number, EMI number, REG number, USCG VIN number, flag, call sign, port of registry, ship contacts, type of hull, crew training, certificates, and deadweight tonnage."
