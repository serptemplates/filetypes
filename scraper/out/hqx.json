      "Converting a binary file to an HQX file helps to maintain the file's integrity when it is sent (or otherwise transferred) over the Internet. Each HQX file contains its associated binary file's data fork, resource fork, and metadata, converted to plain text and compressed into a single file.",

It contains data that has been compressed and encoded from an 8-bit binary format into a 7-bit text format. The HQX format is useful for transferring binary images, documents, and multimedia as text in email attachments."
