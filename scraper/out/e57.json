      "A file with .e57 extension is a compact, vendor-neutral file format that is used for storing and exchange of three-dimensional (3D) imaging data such as point clouds, images, and metadata. Such data is often created with systems such as laser scanners. It was developed by the Data Interoperability sub-committee of the ATSM E57 Committee on 3D Imaging Systems. E57 is open source and stores 3D point data, its attributes (such as color and intensity), and 2D imagery as captured by the 3D imaging system.",
      "3D image file created in the ASTM E57 format, a format used for storing data captured by 3D imaging systems; saves LIDAR (light detection and ranging) data, which was captured by 3D range cameras; enables remote sensing data to be saved in a vendor-neutral format."
