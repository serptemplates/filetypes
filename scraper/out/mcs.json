      "While the format is no longer developed, Mathcad used MCS files to save and reuse visual content within technical documents. Engineers, scientists, and students used these images to illustrate calculations or present data visually. The format allows users to capture and store Mathcad-generated graphics separately from the main worksheet, making it easier to include them in reports or other documents.",

      "An MCS file is a raster image created by older versions of PTC Mathcad, a program used to perform, document, and share engineering and mathematical calculations. It contains image data, a grid of pixels that represents a graphic or diagram generated in Mathcad. MCS images may include plots, graphs, or visual representations of mathematical data created as part of a worksheet."
