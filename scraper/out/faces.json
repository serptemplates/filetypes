      "FacesServlet is a JavaServer Faces servlet that manages a web app's request processing lifecycle. In order to invoke FacesServlet and allow it to render the JavaServer Faces components included in an XHTML file, developers must sometimes specify a file path that ends with the .faces, .jsf, or .xhtml extension. When FacesServlet encounters a file path that ends with .faces, it knows to search for a corresponding XHTML file that includes JavaServer Faces components."

      "The .faces extension is used by some versions of JavaServer Faces to invoke the FacesServlet servlet. However, FACES files do not actually exist. When developers specify a path to a FACES file (e.g. http://localhost:8080/webapp/page.faces), JavaServer Faces searches for and renders the FacesServlet components included in an app's corresponding WebContent .XHTML file (e.g. Webapp/WebContent/page.xhtml)."
