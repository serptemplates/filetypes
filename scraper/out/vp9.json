      "Google has developed the VP9 codec as a royalty-free, open-source video coding standard as the successor to VP8. It was originally designed to compress the ultra HD content on YouTube because it expands and enhances the coding efficiency of its predecessor. If we talk about the original VPX codecs, they came from On2 Technologies, which was assimilated by Google in 2010. Google later open-sourced the codec. VP8 and VP9 both formats are available under a free BSD license that permits operators to organize encode or decode proficiencies in both exclusive software and open-source software without revealing their source code."
