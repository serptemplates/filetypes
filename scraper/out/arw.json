      "ARW is a raw camera image format proprietary to Sony Alpha digital cameras. Other proprietary camera raw formats include the Canon Raw 3 Image format (.CR3) and the Nikon Electronic Format (.NEF).",
      "Professional photographers and camera hobbyists utilizing Sony Alpha digital cameras will most likely encounter ARW camera raw files. The files store more image data than compressed images, such as .JPG or .PNG, which allows photographers to capture higher-quality images and edit them more accurately.",
      "The sensor on one Sony camera model may differ from the sensor on another camera. Also, some Sony camera models store RAW images with the .arw file extension but in different formats. Therefore, you should check the documentation of your photo editing software before assuming that it supports a specific camera model.",
      "NOTE: To ensure that your Sony Alpha camera captures images as ARW files, verify that the image quality section in the camera menu is set to \"RAW.\""

      "ARW file is also know as Alpha Raw file. It is a type of digital image used by Sony cameras and contains raw, unprocessed data captured by camera’s image sesnor. The captured data is uncompressed and retains all the original information captured by camera allowing greater flexibilty in post processing.\n\nARW files typically store a high level of detail, dynamic range and color depth. They provide photographers with more control over aspects such as white balance, exposure, and noise reduction during editing process. However, since ARW files are raw and unprocessed, they require specialized software to view and edit properly.\n\nARW files (.arw) are raw image files—essentially digital negatives—produced by many Sony camera models. These files contain unprocessed image data, meaning they bypass in-camera processing features to preserve the original scene as captured by the sensor. Unlike JPEG files, which are compressed and often under 1 MB, ARW files can be significantly larger, sometimes reaching 1–2 GB in size, especially if they store multiple images. ARW file names typically include a sequential number (e.g., “…1”), which increments with each new photo captured.",
      "The format of ARW file is binary format.",
      "An ARW file is a camera raw image captured by various Sony digital cameras, such as the a6300 and a7R III. It contains raw, uncompressed image data captured by the camera's sensor in the Sony Alpha Raw (ARW) format based on the TIFF specification. Several image editors can open, edit, and convert ARW files, including Adobe Photoshop Elements, Apple Preview, and XnViewMP."
