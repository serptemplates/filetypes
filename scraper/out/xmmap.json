      "MindManager enables you to create diagrams for brainstorming ideas, planning events, recording meeting notes, and more. When you save a mind map, you can choose between saving it as an MMAP file or an XMMAP file. The advantage of the MMAP binary format is that it requires less storage space. However, the XMMAP XML format is more transportable since other applications more easily read it.",
