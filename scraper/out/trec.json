      "Camtasia is a Windows and macOS app that captures screen activity, can edit the video, then publish the video in several multimedia formats or to online platforms, such as YouTube. Videos you might create with Camtasia include webinars, software demonstrations, video conferences, how-to tutorials, and online gaming sessions.",
      "The Windows and macOS versions of Camtasia save recordings in the TREC format, which makes sharing recordings across platforms convenient. In addition, Camtasia saves TREC files as part of .TSCPROJ (Windows version that replaced .CAMPROJ) and .CMPROJ (macOS version) screen-recording projects.",
      "NOTE: TechSmith introduced the TREC format when it released version 8.4.0 of Camtasia Studio (Windows version) and version 2.8.0 of Camtasia for Mac. It replaced the .CAMREC and .CMREC extensions for camera recordings."
