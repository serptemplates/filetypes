      "A DBM (Daz Brick Material) file is a Shader Mixer network file created with 3D character modeling application, DAZ Studio. It describes the material of the 3D mode i.e. surface/displacement/interior volume. DAZ allows you to create your own custom shader by connecting a series of bricks together. This combines collectively as a DBM file that forms a shader network. It is the DBM file that specifies how a material is shaded.\n\nApplications that can open DBM files include DAZ 3D DAZ Studio 4.",
      "Web page written in DBML (Database Markup Language), the predecessor to Adobe's CFML (ColdFusion Markup Language); executed by a web server running ColdFusion, which generates HTML that is sent to a user's computer; similar to a .ASP or .PHP file, but requires ColdFusion to be run."
