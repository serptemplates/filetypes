      "You most likely will only see the NWCAB file if you search the Neat Data folder in your Documents folder. Typically, there are two other files in the Neat Data folder with the NWCAB file: A Neatworks file and an image file, both with the \".nwdb\" extension.",
      "If you come across an error message indicating that you cannot open a Neat database, it most likely means that a file in your database is corrupt, locked by another program, or missing. You should check that all three files are in the Neat Data folder. If one of the three files is missing then it causes the error message.",
