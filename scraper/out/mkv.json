      "The Matroska multimedia container format is open source and was initially released in December 2002. It is similar to the .AVI, .ASF, and .MOV formats and can contain any number of video, audio, image, and subtitle tracks. Multimedia files that utilize the Matroska container format and store one or more video tracks are known as Matroska Video files and are distinguished by the .mkv file extension.",
      "In addition to storing short video clips, TV shows, and movies, it has become popular in the anime fan-subbing community for saving multimedia with subtitles. The MKV format is especially helpful since it supports multiple audio and subtitle tracks in the same file.",

      "MKV (Matroska Video) is a multimedia container similar to MOV and AVI format but it supports more than one audio and subtitle track in the same file. An MKV file is the Matroska multimedia container format used for video. MKV is based on Extensible Binary Meta Language and it supports several video and audio compression formats. The major difference between MKV and other video formats is that MKV is a container and not a codec. MKV files are saved with the .mkv file extension. MKV can incorporate audio, video, and subtitles in a single file even if those elements use different types of encoding. For example, you could have an MKV file that contains H.264 video and MP3 or AAC for audio. MKV also supports descriptions, ratings, cover art, and even chapter points. There are several key features that MKV is future-proof. These features include:\n\nSupport for Fast seeking.Ability to select different audio and video streams.Support for subtitles(hard-coded and soft-coded).Support for metadata, chapters, and menus.Capability to stream online.Ability to recover erroneous files that provide the capability to play corrupted files.",
      "An MKV file is a video file saved in the Matroska multimedia container format that often stores short video clips, TV shows, and movies. It supports several types of audio and video codecs and may include .SRT, .SSA, .USF (Universal Subtitle Format), or VobSub subtitles. Many video players can open MKV files, including Microsoft Windows Media Player 2022 and VideoLAN VLC media player."
