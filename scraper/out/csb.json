      "CRI Middleware, also known as CRIWARE, is a company that provides audio and movie middleware tools to video game developers. Using CRI-ADX, developers can create and integrate various types of audio, including CSB files, into their video games.",
      "CSB files are archives that usually contain two .ADX or .ACB audio files. The first ADX or ACB file contains a song's unique, introductory measures, and the second ADX or ACB file contains the portion of the song that loops while a player remains in a menu or stage.",
      "Street Fighter IV and Sonic game modders are most likely to encounter CSB files, while attempting to edit a game's background music. For example, players using the Windows version of Street Fighter IV can find that game's CSB files in its SFIV/​bgm directory."
