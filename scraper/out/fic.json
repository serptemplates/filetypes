      "The FIC file in WinDev is a compiled version of a HyperFileSQL Database. The acronym FIC stands for “Fichier de Code” in French, which translates to “Code File” in English. In WINDEV, a FIC file is a compiled file that contains the executable code of a project. The file has the extension .fic and it is created when you compile a WINDEV project. Once a project is compiled into a FIC file, it can be distributed to users as an executable program or an installation package.\n\nFIC file is related to WINDEV, a software development tool created by PCSoft, a French company. It allows developers to create Windows, web, and mobile applications using a single code base. It includes a visual development environment, a programming language (WLangage), and a variety of pre-built controls and functions for common tasks. It is primarily used for business applications and has a strong user base in Europe.",
      "Relational database format used by WinDev Windows and mobile device development software; stores a relational database and may be a HyperFileSQL Mobile database or a HyperFileSQL Client/Server database; used for storing structured data for WinDev applications."
