      "WDZip can be used to create archives in several different formats. The default format the program uses is the WDZ format, but it can also save in the .ZIP, .RAR, .CAB, and .7Z formats.",

      "When creating an archive, you may choose to split it into several sub-archives if it is a large archive. These sub-archives can be merged together when opening the archive. If you split a WDZ archive, the first sub-archive is a WDZ file and the next sub-archive is a .001 file, then a .002 file, and so on.",
