      "Typinator enables the computer user to type shortcuts instead of having to type the whole sentence. It's especially helpful for users who have to repeatedly type the same phrases, sentences, and URL addresses. Users can add to these set files by creating abbreviations, for e.g., \"love\" can be added for the sentence \"I love you.\" It's also used as an AutoCorrection tool for misspellings, for e.g., \"poeple\" becomes \"people.\"",
      "NOTE: These files can be created by selecting Action → Export... in the Typinator window menu then choose \"Typinator Set (.tyset)\" in the Export as: drop down menu."
