      "VMDL files were introduced with the release of the Source 2 engine. The files replaced the .MDL files. A VMDL file is created from a mesh file stored in an .FBX, .OBJ, or .DMX file. To do this, open Model Editor, select File → New VMDL From Mesh File and choose a mesh. After selecting a mesh, the VMDL file is created and named with the same name as the mesh. For example, a sample.fbx mesh file becomes a sample.vmdl file."

      "A VMDL file is a model file created by the Model Editor tool included with Valve DOTA 2 Workshop Tools, a suite of tools used to customize gameplay in DOTA 2. It contains model information in plain text that describes a character or object that appears in DOTA 2. VMDL files are compiled into binary VMDL_C files in Model Editor, which are then used in DOTA 2."
