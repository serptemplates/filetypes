      "While the Mac version of Filmora saves projects as WSVE files, the Windows version saves projects as .WVE files. However, with the release of Filmora9 in December 2018, Wondershare replaced WSVE and WVE files with the .WFP project format. Filmora9 and later versions still support the WSVE and WVE file types.",
