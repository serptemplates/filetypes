      "Many businesses used Lotus 1-2-3 during the 1980s and 1990s for financial calculations, data tracking, and reporting. In these contexts, users created WKU files to organize information, perform calculations, and generate printed reports. As Lotus Software (later acquired by IBM) continued to develop Lotus 1-2-3, it released newer file formats, such as .WK1, .WK3 and .WK4, which replaced WKU, offering more features and improved compatibility."
