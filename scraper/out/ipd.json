      "An IPD file is a BlackBerry data backup file created when a BlackBerry mobile phone is backed up on a computer using BlackBerry Desktop Manager. It contains all the data from a BlackBerry phone in a database format, which includes contacts, calls, SMS messages, emails, calendars, tasks, memos, photos, and videos. IPD files can be used to restore a BlackBerry if the software on the phone becomes corrupt."
