      "MPEG-4 is a multimedia container format that supports video, audio, subtitle, and image data encoded in different codecs. MPEG-4 files that store video bear the .mp4 file extension (.MP4 files). However, if the MPEG-4 file only stores audio, it is saved with the .m4a extension, which stands for \"MPEG-4 Audio.\" This name change helped distinguish between MPEG-4 video files and MPEG-4 audio-only files.",
      "You will most likely encounter M4A files when downloading audio content via the Apple iTunes Store. The content, typically songs, is encoded with AAC compression, which significantly reduces the size of each file. In addition, songs that include copyright protection have an .m4p file extension (.M4P files)."

      "The M4A file format, an abbreviation for MPEG 4 Audio, is a versatile audio container known for its high-quality, lossy compression via the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) codec. Identified by the .m4a file extension, it is the standard for un-protected audio content and can store a diverse range of media, including songs, podcasts, and audiobooks. Technologically, M4A is recognized as a more advanced successor to the MP3 format. A key differentiator is its dedicated design for audio, whereas the MP3 format was originally conceived as a mere audio layer within MPEG 1 or MPEG 2 video files.\n\nM4A format is encrypted by FairPlay Digital Rights Management as were sold via the iTunes Store use the .m4p extension. The Apple iPhones use MPEG-4 audio for their ringtones but those audio files use the .m4r extension.",
