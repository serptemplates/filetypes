      "Adobe Premiere Pro is a professional video editing application for creating feature films, broadcasts, and other video presentations. When saving a project in Premiere Pro, the application creates a PRPROJ file to store the contents.",
      "PRPROJ files store references to media assets (video, audio, graphics); they do not store the actual media data in the file itself. The references to these media assets are created when you import the asset into your project. Therefore, if you move the asset after importing it, Premiere Pro will not be able to locate the asset for the project, which will prompt you to relocate the asset.",
      "To create a PRPROJ file, select File → New → Project..., modify your project, then select File → Save or Save As.... Once you save the PRPROJ file, you can close it, re-open it, then continue editing the project."

      "The PRPROJ file format is the proprietary project file format used by Adobe Premiere Pro, a video editing software. PRPROJ files store all of the elements and information required for a video project, including video and audio clips, transitions, effects, and timeline and sequence settings. The file format is optimized for use with Premiere Pro and is not compatible with other video editing software. To open and edit a PRPROJ file, you must have Adobe Premiere Pro installed on your computer. Additionally, because PRPROJ files are saved in a proprietary format, they cannot be opened or edited with other software, and must be exported as a different file format if you need to share the project with someone who does not have access to Premiere Pro.",
      "A PRPROJ file is a video project created by Adobe Premiere Pro, a video editing application. It contains a timeline comprised of video and audio clips and includes transitions, special effects, and other applied edits. PRPROJ files also store project settings related to transitions, the video renderer, audio and video display format, and the capture format."
