FNT files have been mostly replaced by TrueType (.TTF) and OpenType (.OTF) file formats, and is an obsolete font file format as of now. These files can store a single rater or vector font. All device drivers support the Windows 2.x fonts. However, not all device drivers support the Windows 3.0 version.",
