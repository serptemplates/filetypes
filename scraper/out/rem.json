      "The easiest way to open REM files on your computer is to use BlackBerry Desktop Manager (Windows, Mac) to transfer the files from your phone to your PC. During the transfer process, Desktop Manager will automatically decrypt the REM files you transfer, allowing you to open them as you would normally. (Note that, in most cases, you must transfer the REM files from the phone that created them, as REM encryption is often device-specific. Also, you must know the device's password, as you will have to enter it during the process.)",
      "If you cannot decrypt your REM files, you can try transferring them to your PC and simply renaming them to not use the .rem extension. (For example, you would rename YourPhoto.jpg.rem to YourPhoto.jpg.) Depending on how your REM file was encrypted, you may be able to open it as you would normally after removing the .rem extension."
