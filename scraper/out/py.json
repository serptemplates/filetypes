      "A PY file is a program file or script written in Python, an interpreted object-oriented programming language. It can be created and edited with a text editor, but requires a Python interpreter to run. PY files are often used to program web servers and other administrative computer systems."

Developers who code primarily in Python may want to open their PY files in JetBrains PyCharm, which is a Python IDE for professional developers."
