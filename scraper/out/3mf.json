      "The 3MF file format uses the Open Packaging specifications in the form of ZIP archive for its physical model. It includes a well-defined set of parts and relationships that fullfill particular purpose in the document. This also makes the format follow the package feature including digital signatures and thumbnails.",
      "The 3MF Consortium developed the format to simplify and modernize the 3D printing process, with the first version released in 2015. 3MF is intended to be an all-in-one solution that replaces older formats like .STL, .OBJ, and .AMF, helping to reduce compatibility issues and improve design-to-fabrication workflows.",
      "For example, while the STL format is widely supported, it only stores geometry (just the outer shell), with no color, materials, scale, or metadata. 3MF supports all of this information, combining it all into a single, standardized ZIP-based file.",
      "NOTE: Microsoft founded the 3MF consortium, which includes members such as Autodesk, HP, GE Global Research, Fit AG, Shapeways, SLM Solutions Group, Ultimaker, Stratasys, Siemens PLM Software, and Dassault Systèmes."

      "3MF, 3D Manufacturing Format, is used by applications to render 3D object models to a variety of other applications, platforms, services and printers. It was built to avoid the limitations and issues in other 3D file formats, like STL, for working with the latest versions of 3D printers. 3MF is relatively a new file format that has been developed and published by the 3MF consortium. It is rich enough to fully describe a model, retaining internal information, colour, and other characteristics that makes it extensible for supporting new innovations in 3D printing. The format is extensible, able to be broadly adopted and free of issues besetting other widely used file formats.",
      "A 3MF file is a 3D model saved in the 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF), which is supported by various 3D design and printing applications. It is a Zip-compressed archive that contains a 3D model’s geometry, material information, and other properties. 3MF files may also include a print ticket (with recommended print settings), a .JPG or .PNG thumbnail, digital signatures, and other metadata (e.g., author, license, or production notes)."

      "You can open 3MF files with various apps, including the free Microsoft 3D Builder app in Windows and the cross-platform Ultimaker Cura and PrusaSlicer apps. For example, to open a 3MF file with 3D Builder, click the hamburger menu icon and then select Open.",
      "Since 3MF files are Zip-compressed, you can extract their contents with a Zip utility, such as Windows File Explorer, Corel WinZip, or Apple Archive Utility. You may need to rename the .3mf file extension to .zip for the utility to recognize the format and extract the contents of the archive."
