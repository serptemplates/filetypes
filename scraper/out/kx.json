      "Since KIX files are saved in a text format that can be viewed and edited by a text editor, the KX file provides a higher level of security. KX tokenized scripts can be run from the KiXtart command line and by using the CALL command, unless the KX file is password protected."

      "A KX file is a tokenized version of the .KIX file written in the KiXtart scripting language. It is a script that is smaller and can be processed faster than KIX scripts. The file is encrypted and contains a signature for protection from any accidental changes in the script."
