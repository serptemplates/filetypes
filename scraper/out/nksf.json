      "Komplete Kontrol is a DAW-agnostic plug-in (as well as a standalone app) that allows musicians to load, organize, and use presets with many popular DAWs, including Native Instruments Komplete, Ableton Live, Steinberg Cubase, and others. Musicians can also use Komplete Kontrol to transfer presets to Komplete Kontrol keyboards and other MIDI devices.",
      "While Komplete Kontrol can load presets saved in many different formats, its primary supported format is NKSF (Native Kontrol Standard Format). Thus, Native Instruments and other DAW publishers often publish presets in the NKSF format, so they can easily be used with Komplete Kontrol."
