      "Pixen allows users to design and save custom patterns as PXPATTERN files, which they can then reuse in other projects. For example, a pixel artist may create a repeating cobblestone pattern in Pixen and save it as a PXPATTERN file to quickly fill large areas of a game map. The artist then reuses the pattern across multiple scenes to keep the design consistent and speed up their workflow.",
      "NOTE: To create a PXPATTERN file with the Pro version of Pixen, select Patterns, right-click the pattern, and select Export. The free version cannot export PXPATTERN files."

      "A PXPATTERN file is a pattern created by Pixen, a pixel art editor developed by Furnace Creek Software for macOS. It stores tileable image patterns that artists can apply repeatedly across a canvas to create consistent backgrounds, textures, or decorative elements. PXPATTERN files are especially helpful for users creating pixel-based artwork, game environments, or repeating textures that require uniform visual elements."
