      "Nexus is a collection of tools used to convert large 3D models to the NXS format, edit NXS files, and view NXS files. Notably, converting a model to the NXS format allows users to view the model at different resolutions, optimized for their (GPU's|gpu) resources. This makes it easier for users to view large, graphics-intensive 3D models.",

      "An NXS file is a 3D model created and used by the Nexus 3D model toolkit. It contains a large 3D model that has been converted from the .PLY (Polygon Model) or .OBJ (Wavefront 3D Object) format to the NXS format. NXS files are created by Nxsbuild and can be viewed with Nxsview."

It also allows you to convert the file to the .PLY format. Nxsview allows you to view the model an NXS file contains."
