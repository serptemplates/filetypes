      "Snappy is an open source compression and decompression library that Google designed to compress files quickly. While other compression programs, such as zlib and 7-Zip, may compress files to smaller sizes than Snappy, Snappy can compress more files in a shorter amount of time. This makes Snappy useful for developers and programs that regularly compress a large number of files (especially if they do not care about the minor increase in compressed files' size).",
      "Files compressed with Snappy have been saved in several formats over the years, including the .SNAPPY, .snz, and .sz file formats. Various programs, especially those that operate on Google's Android operating system, use SNZ files as backups of documents and other files."

      "You can use Snappy (cross-platform) to decompress SNZ files. However, because Snappy is a source code library, typical PC users may have trouble using Snappy to decompress SNZ files. Snzip, a cross-platform compression and decompression tool based on Snappy, can help users decompress SNZ files. Before you can use Snzip, you must install Snappy."
