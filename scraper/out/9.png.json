      "NinePatchDrawable images are often created/edited with the Draw 9-patch tool found in Google Android SDK. This file is frequently used by Android Developers to help create the user interface. The Draw 9-patch tool enables the user to create an image defined by 9 areas or patches: 4 corners, 4 edges, and the middle area. The user can edit the 9 patches to reflect how they want the image to be stretched. Also, the file must be saved into the res/​drawable/​ directory of the project."
