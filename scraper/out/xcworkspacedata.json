      "Developers working on apps with multiple interdependent projects or libraries may encounter XCWORKSPACEDATA files. The files enable Xcode to coordinate builds, manage dependencies, and maintain a consistent workspace environment.",
      "Specifically, XCWORKSPACEDATA files contain references to projects included in the workspace, the user interface state, window layouts, and other workspace-level configuration details. Xcode automatically generates and updates the files whenever a user creates and modifies a workspace.",
      "NOTE: You can find XCWORKSPACEDATA files in .XCWORKSPACE files, which are macOS packages."

      "An XCWORKSPACEDATA file is a data file used by Apple Xcode, an integrated development environment (IDE) for macOS, iOS, watchOS, and tvOS applications. It stores information in the XML standard about a workspace, which is a container that groups multiple Xcode projects and other related files. Xcode uses XCWORKSPACEDATA files to manage project organization, relationships, and settings across all projects within the workspace."

      "XCWORKSPACEDATA files are not meant to be opened. Instead, Apple Xcode references the files to load the information they contain.",
      "Since the files store XML information, you can open them with a text editor. However, opening them with a text editor will not appear the same as if opening them with Xcode."
