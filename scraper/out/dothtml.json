      "A DOTHTML file is a Microsoft Word template document saved in HTML version. It can be opened in web browser and contents are displayed as any other web page. DOTHTML files are generated from Microsoft Word .DOT files that contain pre-formatted settings for generating these files. When a DOT file is converted to DOCHTML, all these settings are retained and the converted DOTHTML file is displayed with similar formatting as the original DOT file. This way, published templates can be viewed in web browser.",
      "A DOTHTML file is an HTML version of a .DOT file created with Microsoft Word, a word processing application. It contains HTML source code that can be used to display the document with similar formatting to the original DOT file. DOTHTML files are used for viewing published templates in a web browser."
