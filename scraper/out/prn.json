      "To send a PRN file to a printer in Windows, you can enter the command copy/b yourfilename.prn \\\\yourcomputername\\yourprintername at the Windows Command Prompt (assuming you use a network- or USB-connected printer). Remember, however, that the PRN file will print correctly only if it was created by a printer that is compatible with your own.",
      "On Macs, you can use a PRN file to open and print a copy of your document with Apple Preview. If you are having trouble opening a PRN file in Preview, you might be able to open it by changing its extension to .PS.",
      "If necessary, you can view a PRN file's contents using any text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, or GitHub Atom. However, because PRN files are created in a variety of formats for use with a variety of devices, there is no guarantee that your PRN file will contain any usable information. Also, you should not edit your PRN file, as doing so might make the file unprintable."
