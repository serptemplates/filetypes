      "MEM files are helpful for backing up temporary data and reusing sets of predefined variables (users can export memory variables to a MEM file using the SAVE TO command). Because of this, developers often used MEM files in development workflows, testing routines, and configuration management within Visual FoxPro applications.",

      "A MEM file is a data file used by Microsoft Visual FoxPro (originally FoxPro), a discontinued relational database management system (RDBMS) used to build desktop database applications. It stores information about memory variables and arrays created during a Visual FoxPro session. Developers often save these variables in a MEM file to preserve the current state of a project or to share values between sessions."
