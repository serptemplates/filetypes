      "GPX files are used to exchange GPS location data, including maps, routes, and geocaching information, with others. Most commonly, fitness devices and applications, such as Garmin Connect devices, use GPX files to import and export running and biking routes. More sophisticated mapping applications, including the desktop versions of Google Earth Pro and the web version of Google Maps, also create and use GPX files.",
      "GPX files store three types of data:",
      "Waypoint - Includes GPS coordinates of a point. It may also include other descriptive information.",
      "Route - Includes a list of track points, which are waypoints for turn or stage points, that lead to a destination.",
      "Track - Includes a list of points that describe a path.",

      "A GPX file is a GPS data file saved in the GPS Exchange format, which is an open standard used by many GPS programs. It contains longitude and latitude location data that may include waypoints, routes, and tracks. GPX files are saved in XML format, which allows GPS data to be more easily imported and read by multiple programs and web services."
