      "The STUDIO3 file is the primary file associated with version 3 of Silhouette Studio. When you create and save a design project, the STUDIO3 file is the default format used to store the design. However, you can also choose to save the design as a .STUDIO or .GSP file. The STUDIO3 file replaced the STUDIO file with the release of version 3. The STUDIO file was used by versions 1 and 2 of Silhouette Studio.",
      "Once you are finished with your design you can verify the cutting, emboss, deboss, grid, registration marks, stipple, and cut settings. You can then send it to a connected Silhouette device for cutting."
