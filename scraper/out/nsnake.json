      "You can open an NSNAKE file in nSnake (Linux) using the game's Level Select feature. To use an NSNAKE file with nSnake, you must place the file in the ~/​.local/​share/​nsnake/​levels directory. By default, nSnake installs NSNAKE files in the usr/​share/​games/​nsnake/​levels directory, so players must manually move the game's NSNAKE files to the ~/​.local/​share/​nsnake/​levels directory before they can begin playing.",
      "If you want to edit the level an NSNAKE file contains, you can do so by opening and editing it in any text editor."
