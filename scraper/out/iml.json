      "IML files store module-level settings for larger development projects. IntelliJ IDEA uses .IPR or .IDEA files (depending on the project's version) to store overall project settings. These files may reference multiple IML files. IPR and IML files both use XML formatting.",
      "If you accidentally delete a module's IML file, you can often regenerate the file by either opening and closing your IDE, rebuilding your project, or reimporting your project.",
      "NOTE: Android Studio, an Android software development tool based on the IntelliJ IDEA engine, also uses IML files to store information for Android development modules."

      "An IML file is a module settings file created by IntelliJ IDEA, an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) used to develop Java applications. It stores information about a development module, which is a Java, Plugin, Android, or Maven component of a Java application. IML files store a module’s type, paths, dependencies, and other settings."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "Because IML files contain automatically generated and updated module settings, you likely should not manually open or edit them. However, if you want to open an IML file, you can open it using any text or source code editor, such as Notepad++ (Windows), Microsoft Visual Studio Code (cross-platform), or GitHub Atom (cross-platform)."
