      "In most cases, you should not need to open a TORCHDOWNLOAD file. Instead, you should either wait for your download to finish or, if your download was interrupted, resume your download. Then, Torch will replace its TORCHDOWNLOAD file with the file you began downloading.",
      "If your download was interrupted and you can't resume it, you might be able to recover a portion of the file you intended to download. To do so, delete the .torchdownload extension from your TORCHDOWNLOAD file and then attempt to open the file in an appropriate program. For example, if you began downloading a video file, delete the .torchdownload extension and then attempt to play the file in your media player. Your media player should play as much of the video as you'd managed to download."
