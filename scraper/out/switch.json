      "SWITCH files are typically used by companies to comply with security standards for exchanging sensitive data. But they may also be used by average users to securely send confidential information.",
      "Users can package their file(s) in the SWITCH file, then send it to the recipient via email, CD/DVD, or cloud server. The recipient can then use Switch to open the file. This method secures the package of confidential files to protect from unauthorized users. Also, when creating a SWITCH package, you can set restrictions for when the file can be opened and choose how the package is to be sent to the recipient.",
      "You can open a SWITCH file using Switch, which is available for Windows and macOS. You can also upload a SWITCH file to Switch Web Access in your web browser to open the file."
