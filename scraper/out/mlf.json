      "The software's helper tool, MIRP Layout Designer, creates and edits MLF files. Users saved layouts in the MLF format via this tool and then import them into the MIRP app for use. While the tool provides a visual interface for assigning keys (clicking on a note and pressing the desired key), the resulting file stores information in a plain text format that a user can manually edit if needed."

      "An MLF file is a layout file used by MIRP (MIDI Input to Roblox Piano), an application designed to map MIDI keyboard input to keystrokes for playing Roblox Virtual Piano. It contains a custom mapping in which each MIDI note corresponds to a specific key on a standard keyboard. Mappings stored in MLF files allow users to play a MIDI keyboard and have the mapped notes produce input on their computer keyboard."
