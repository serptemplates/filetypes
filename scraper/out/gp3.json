      "Arobas Music Guitar Pro is a multitrack guitar composition tool. Guitar Pro was initially designed only for Windows but expanded to Mac OS X in July 2006 with version 5 of the software.",
      "Whit each new version of Guitar Pro, the software saves tabs with an extension that corresponds with the software version. For example, Guitar Pro 5 saves tabs as .GP5 files, Guitar Pro 4 saves tabs as .GP4 files, and so on. However, each new version of Guitar Pro still supports previous Guitar Pro file types."
