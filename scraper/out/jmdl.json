      "Some WiiU and 3DS video games use the .JARC archive format to store game assets. JARC archives contain in-game model, texture, and animation files. Together, these files are used to show and animate game characters, locations, and items.",
      "JMDL files are in-game model files, which contain a 3D model that represents an in-game character, location, or item. For example, the file used to show Wii Fit U's Wuhu Island is a JMDL file. JMDL files do not include textures or animations, as those are stored in .JTEX and .JMOT files, respectively."
