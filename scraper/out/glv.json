      "A GLV file is a low-resolution video created by various Garmin devices, such as CamperCam 795 and Garmin Dash Cam 46, to provide a mobile preview of a high-resolution .MP4 video. Several Garmin mobile apps, including the VIRB, Drive, and dēzl mobile apps, support the Garmin low-resolution format (GLV) and automatically load GLV files to display previews within the app of the MP4 videos the files accompany."
