      "In most cases, Apple AirDrop and other image-sharing services correctly share Live Photos as HEIC or converted image files. For example, when you AirDrop a Live Photo from your iPhone to a Mac, the photo appears as an HEIC file. And when you share a Live Photo via Apple Mail, the app automatically converts the photo to the .JPG format.",
      "However, on some rare occasions, Live Photos are instead shared as PVT files. If you are encountering this issue, you may want to disable the Live Photos feature, by tapping the Live Photos button that appears in the upper-right corner of your iPhone's Camera app."

      "A PVT file is a type of Live Photo, a combination of pictures and videos created by an iPhone. Usually, Live Photos have a different name like .HEIC, but sometimes when you share them using services like AirDrop, they might end up with a .pvt extension by mistake. Normally, when you send a Live Photo, it should be in .HEIC format (or changed to .JPG in some cases). For instance, if you AirDrop it to a Mac, it should show up as an HEIC file. But occasionally, it might turn into a PVT file.",
      "A PVT file is a Live Photo created by an iPhone's Camera app. It has been mistakenly renamed to use the .pvt extension instead of the .HEIC extension. Apple AirDrop and other image-sharing services sometimes rename Live Photos to use the .pvt extension when you share Live Photos from your iPhone."
