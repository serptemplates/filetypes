      "A PCX file, Picture Exchange file, is a raster image file format that was used as native file format for PC Paintbrush application. It was developed by ZSoft Corporation, USA for DOS and Windows platforms and was adopted as the main imaging file format before the arrival of BMP, JPEG, and PNG file formats. PCX files are smaller in size as they are compressed using the RLE encoding. It is used in the multi-page DCX file that is primarily used to create digital fax files.",
      "Raster image format developed by ZSoft; became one of the original bitmap image formats for the DOS/Windows platform; supports 24-bit color images, 8-bit grayscale and indexed color images, and 1-bit black and white images; compressed using RLE encoding."
