      "In 1992, WordPerfect Corporation released an integrated office productivity suite named WordPerfect Works. This program bundled together WordPerfect, LetterPerfect, and reduced feature set versions of DrawPerfect and PlanPerfect. It saved the text documents users created as WPW files, to denote that they were created using WordPerfect Works, rather than the base version of WordPerfect.",
      "After Novell acquired WordPerfect Corporation, they released an updated version of WordPerfect Works named PerfectWorks. Novell released PerfectWorks for Windows in 1995. When Corel acquired WordPerfect from Novell in 1996, they did not continue publishing PerfectWorks. Instead, Corel opted to create a new WordPerfect Office productivity suite."
