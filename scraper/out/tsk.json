      "Pocket PC devices were handheld computers developed in the late 1990s and early 2000s that ran versions of Microsoft’s Windows Mobile operating system. These devices were precursors to smartphones, often included touchscreens and styluses, and were used for tasks like email, calendar management, mobile web browsing, and media playback.",
      "Users could download TSK files from theme websites or create their own using tools like Microsoft’s Theme Generator. They would then transfer the TSK file to their PDA (likely via ActiveSync or a memory card) and select the theme from the “Today” settings screen to alter the device’s home screen and overall interface appearance."

      "A TSK file is a theme file used by Pocket PC devices, which were early personal digital assistants (PDAs) that ran on Microsoft’s Windows Mobile operating system. It contains a background image, menu styling, and color scheme settings that define the look of the device’s interface, including the home screen and menus, in a format similar to the Windows Cabinet (.CAB) format. Pocket PC users installed TSK files to personalize the appearance of their device’s interface with custom colors, wallpapers, and design styles."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open a TSK file by transferring it to a Pocket PC device with Microsoft ActiveSync. However, Pocket PC devices are obscure.",
      "Since TSK files are similar to the Windows Cabinet (CAB) format, you can use a program that supports the CAB format to extract the contents from a TSK file. Possible options include Corel WinZip, 7-Zip, and RARLAB WinRAR. You may need to rename the .tsk file extension to .cab for the program to recognize the file."
