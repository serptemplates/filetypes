      "Most Unix-based operating systems include a system manual divided into eight numbered sections. The sixth section of this manual includes documentation of games, screensavers, and other \"funny little programs\" included in the operating system. Each program's documentation is saved in a separate 6 file.",
      "NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1, .2, .3, .4, .5, .7, and .8 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."
