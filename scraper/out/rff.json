      "Blood was developed by Monolith Productions and published by GT Interactive in 1997. Like many 3D games of that era, Blood was created using Ken Silverman's Build Engine.",
      "Unlike other Build Engine games, however, Blood does not store any game assets in GRP files. Instead, it stores assets that would typically be stored in GRP files in RFF files.",
      "While RFF files are used similarly to GRP files, the two formats are not identical. For example, some RFF files contain encrypted sections, to prevent modders from extracting and/or modifying their contents. Also, RFF files do not contain any in-game graphics, while GRP files often do."
