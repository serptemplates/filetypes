      "ZI_ files are created when a user compresses one or more files as in the Zip format but then renames the \".zip\" extension as \".zi_\". If you receive a ZI_ file, simply rename the extension as \".zip\" and open it with a Zip compression program, such as Corel WinZip, RARLAB WinRAR, Apple Archive Utility, or B1 Free Archiver."

      "A ZI_ file is a renamed .ZIP archive that uses an underscore (\"_\") instead of the \"p\" so that the file cannot be accidentally expanded when double-clicked. It is also used to bypass antivirus programs when sent via email. ZI_ files can be renamed back to \".zip\" files and then decompressed."
