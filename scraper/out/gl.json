      "Doug Wolfgram initially developed GRASP in the early 1980s, and it eventually became one of the most widely used multimedia animation formats. Then, in the early 1990s, John Bridges assumed the primary development of the software. He then succeeded the software in 2002 with AfterGRASP.",

      "A GL file is an animation created by GRASP (Graphical System for Presentation), an MS-DOS program used to create and play back animations. It stores a simple animation in the GRASP format that users would insert into games, presentations, and tutorials. While prominent in the 1980s and 90s, GRASP is now an obscure, no longer developed format."
