      "You can open a UF2 file in one of Microsoft MakeCode's many UF2 editors (Web). The editor you want to open your UF2 file in will likely depend on what type of program the file contains. For example, if your UF2 file was created in the editor available at maker.makecode.com, you should likely open your file in that editor. All Microsoft MakeCode UF2 editors are linked at the UF2 file format's GitHub page.",
      "To install the program a UF2 file contains on a microcontroller, you must first connect the microcontroller to your computer via a USB cable. Your computer should then recognize the microcontroller as a flash drive. After your microcontroller appears as a selectable drive, drag your UF2 file to the drive."
