      "In these files, audio information is contained in a 26-byte header. Moreover, a series of subsequent data blocks are also included in it. Data blocks follow the header and every block starts along with a type byte that describes the content. The size of these files is 3 bytes. There are some uncompressed audio formats of these files, for example, WAV or AU, etc. These files can store various sounds of instruments, music files, and digital audio clips."

      "The VOC audio files are created by a voice récordee named RCA digital voice recorder. The interviews and lectures are recorded through this device. These files are portable and can be shared through the USB port. The VOC files are compatible with Windows operating systems. These VOC files can be converted into other file formats which are more popular such as MP3.\n\nThe data included in these files can be in raw form or container format. These files were used in Disk operating system games. The sound blaster cards were used for audio and these files were used to do so.",
      "Audio file format used by Creative Labs hardware, such as SoundBlaster sound cards; may be audio clips, sound effects, or instrument sounds, which are also referred to as voices; VOC files are compressed to reduce file size."
