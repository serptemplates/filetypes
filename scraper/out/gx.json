      "G-Code is a standard printing language that many 3D printers recognize and can use to print 3D models. However, GX files differ from typical .GCODE files in the following ways:",
      "Each of a GX file's printing commands is numbered, using N#",
      "GX files contain comments that start with ;",
      "GX files contain a binary file header that describes a BMP preview image and model metadata",
      "For this reason, non-FlashForge printers may not be able to print the model a GX file describes.",
