      "3D printing requires detailed instructions to ensure accurate printing. This process involves breaking down a 3D model into many thin layers. Each layer has its own set of instructions, which are compiled into a GCODE file. The 3D printer reads this file, layer by layer, to build the final object with precision.",
      "G-code is a widely used language in 3D printing, and its name comes from the fact that most commands start with the letter \"G,\" which stands for \"Geometry.\" Before 3D printing became widespread, G-code was used in other machines that rely on precise coordinate-based movements, such as CNC (Computer Numerical Control) mills, drills, and plotters. While G-code is the common language for these machines, the GCODE files created for different types of equipment are not interchangeable, as each type of machine has specific requirements and capabilities.",
      "NOTE: The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) designed G-code, but other organizations, such as Electronic Industries Association (RS-274) and International Organization for Standardization (ISO-6983), have since implemented various standards"

    "description": [
      "A GCODE file contains instructions written in G-code, a language that tells a 3D printer how to perform a print job. Each line in a GCODE file provides a specific command in plain text, such as the speed at which the printer should operate, the temperature settings, and the precise movements of the printer's parts. GCODE files are generated by slicing programs like Simplify3D and Slic3r, which convert CAD drawings into G-code that the 3D printer can understand and execute."

      "You can open a GCODE file with various 3D printing programs, including Simplify3D, Blaze3D, and GCode Viewer. Since the files are plain text files, you can also open them and view their contents in any text editor."
