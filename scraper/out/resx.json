      "Developers commonly store application settings and program resources, such as pictures, in RESX files. If implemented correctly, this allows a developer to modify or update a program's resources without recompiling it, by swapping one RESX file for another. This can be useful when, for example, localizing programs for different regions and languages.",

It is best to open RESX files in source code or XML editors, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code. These programs highlight RESX files' XML syntax, making it easier to read and edit the files' data."
