      "In 2004, Apple created the Apple Lossless Audio Codec. Like FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), ALAC is used to losslessly compress audio files. However, ALAC-encoded files typically have smaller file sizes than FLAC-encoded files (created from the same audio).",
      "Primarily, Apple music applications, such as Apple iTunes and Apple Music, use ALAC to losslessly compress and deliver audio to users. However, because ALAC is just a codec, and not an audio container format, these ALAC-encoded files are typically saved as M4A (MPEG-4 Audio) files. If a file uses the .alac extension, it is likely a misnamed M4A file."

    "description": [
      "The Apple Lossless Audio Codec, commonly known as ALAC, is a high-efficiency audio format that utilizes the MPEG-4 compliant QuickTime container (.m4a). Initially launched as a proprietary technology in 2004, Apple transitioned ALAC to an open-source and royalty-free model in 2011, significantly broadening its accessibility. This format provides a perceptible audio upgrade over lossy codecs like AAC and MP3 by preserving all the original data. While functionally similar to FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), ALAC typically achieves a slightly different compression ratio. For playback, ALAC-encoded files are natively supported on Apple devices through QuickTime and iTunes (now Apple Music), and can be played on Microsoft Windows Media Player with the addition of the K-Lite codec pack.",
      "An ALAC file is an audio file encoded using the Apple Lossless Audio Codec (ALAC). Most likely, it contains a song meant to be played in Apple iTunes or Apple Music. More commonly, ALAC files use the .M4A extension."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open an ALAC file with Apple Music (Mac), Apple QuickTime Player (Mac), Microsoft Windows Media Player (Windows), or VideoLAN VLC media player (multiplatform). Before doing so, you may have to change the file's extension to .m4a, so your media player recognizes the file as an MPEG-4 Audio file."

  "how_to_convert": {

      ".FLAC - Free Lossless Audio Codec",
