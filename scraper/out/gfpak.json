      "Most Pokémon players will never encounter GFPAK files. However, Pokémon modders frequently extract GFPAK files from games and alter the resources they contain. For example, a modder might retrieve a GFPAK file from a game, extract the assets the GFPAK file contains, and alter those assets to make a Pokémon appear differently in-game.",
      "After modifying the resources a GFPAK file contains, modders repackage the resources into a new GFPAK file. They can then install the file in the game from which it came, using custom Nintendo Switch firmware, and/or distribute the file for other players to install."

For example, a GFPAK file may contain a 3D model, textures, and other files used to show a Pokémon in-game. Pokémon Sword and Shield, Pokémon Legends: Arceus, and the Pokémon: Let's Go series all use GFPAK files."
