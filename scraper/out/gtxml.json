      "GT Designer Advanced is a utility bundled with StudioCoast vMix. You can create titles and lower-third graphics with GT Designer Advanced, then import them into vMix to be displayed during a production, such as a streamed demonstration, sporting event, newscast, or sermon.",
      "To create a GTXML file with GT Designer, select File → Save As and choose \"GT XML\" from the format dropdown menu. After saving the title, GT Designer creates a GTXML file to store the title or lower-third graphic information. The GTXML file is a working file, which means you can close the file, re-open it, then continue modifying the title or lower-third graphic.",
      "You can also save a title or lower-third graphic created by GT Designer as a .GTZIP file, which stores its information in a Zip-compressed package. GTZIP files store all of the information that makes up the title or graphic, which includes imported images. GTXML files only store references to images imported in the title or graphic, which means they are typically smaller in size than GTZIP files. However, if you need to share your title or graphic with other GT Designer users you should save it as a GTZIP file since all of the assets included are saved in the file."
