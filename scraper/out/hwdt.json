      "When you save a document in Word the program creates the .DOCX file to store the information by default. However, you can also choose to save the document as a .DOC, .TXT, .PDF, or .ODT file instead of a DOCX file. If you want to use a document layout and settings for future documents you can save your document as an HWDT template. HWDT files are convenient for creating documents such as business plans, resumes, brochures, or newsletters.",
