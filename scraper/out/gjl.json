      "Geometry Jump is a game where players guide a square-shaped character through challenging levels filled with spikes, gaps, and other obstacles by tapping or clicking to jump at the right time. The game features rhythm-based gameplay, as jumps often need to be synchronized with the background music.",
      "GJL files are common within the Geometry Jump community. Geometry Jump players often create custom levels in the game, export them as GJL files, and share them with others, who can then load the files into the game."
