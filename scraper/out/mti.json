      "Musicians and producers use MTI files to save and reuse custom instruments in their compositions. This allows for consistent sound across different projects without reloading or adjusting settings manually each time.",
      "While MadTracker was widely used in the early 2000s, its popularity has declined, and modern digital audio workstations (DAWs) now offer more advanced instrument formats. However, those working with older projects or exploring tracker-based music production may still use MTI files.",

      "An MTI file is an instrument used by MadTracker, a music tracker software for Windows. It contains information about an instrument that can be played back within MadTracker using MIDI data (maps notes to the instruments to play them). MTI files include samples, envelope settings, volume levels, panning, pitch modulation, and other parameters that define how it sounds when triggered by notes in a MadTracker project."
