      "In Access 2000, Microsoft added the ability for users to create Access Data Projects. Via an ADP, Access users could connect to, open, and edit a Microsoft SQL Server database. This allowed database administrators to more easily create and manage Access applications that use SQL Server databases.",
      "ADP files do not themselves contain any database data or objects. Instead, they contain data that Access uses to connect to, read data from, and make changes to an associated SQL Server database, using Microsoft's OLE DB architecture.",
      "With the release of Access 2013, Microsoft discontinued the ADP format. As a result, Access 2013 and later versions cannot open ADP files. For more information about this change, refer to Microsoft's official documentation."

      "A file with .adp extension is a Microsoft Access project file that uses OLE DB component architecture to provide a direct and efficient connection to a Microsoft SQL Server database. Such files do not contain the actual tables, database diagrams or other database elements. ADP files can be created with Access 2007 and 2010. Files created with the earlier versions of Access can also be opened Access 2007 and 2010. ADP files can be opened using Microsoft Access 365.",
