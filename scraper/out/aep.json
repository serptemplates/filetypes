      "When you save a project in After Effects, it creates an AEP file to preserve your timeline, assets, and settings. However, the file does not contain the actual media files; it only stores references to their locations. If you move or rename those files outside After Effects, you will need to relink them when reopening the project.",
      "You can save After Effects projects in two formats:",
      "Binary (AEP) – the standard format, which loads quickly and is ideal for most users.",
      "XML (.AEPX) – a text-based format that's larger and slower to open but can be read or modified with an XML editor, making it useful for automation or backups.",
      "You can also create Team Projects, which are saved to Adobe's cloud and allow for real-time collaborative editing (available to Creative Cloud Enterprise and Teams users). Additionally, After Effects supports project templates saved in .AET (binary) or .AETX (XML) formats for reusing design elements across projects."

It is the main file type used by After Effects to save all the settings and data related to the project such as video footage, still images, audio files, and any other effects. AEP file contains information about the composition, layers, keyframes, effects, and other elements that are part of the After Effects project.\n\nYou can open AEP files with Adobe After Effects software.",

It contains one or more compositions comprised of layered elements, such as video clips, audio, images, text, and effects.
