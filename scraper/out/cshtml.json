      "CSHTML files are similar to .VBHTML (Visual Basic HTML) files. However, they use syntax that is closer to the C# language than the Visual Basic language.",
      "One easy way to recognize a CSHTML file is to look for @ symbols that precede Razor reserved directives and code blocks. CSHTML files use the @ symbol and Razor reserved directives to transition from HTML markup to C# code.",
      "Most CSHTML files are created in Microsoft Visual Studio. Visual Studio provides syntax highlighting and Intellisense code suggestions that help developers create CSHTML files.",

      "A file with .cshtml extension is a C# HTML file that is used at server side by Razor Markup engine to render the webpage files to user’s browser. This server side coding is similar to the standard ASP.NET page enabling dynamic web content creation on the fly as the webpage is written to the browser. The server executes the server-side code inside the page before sending the generated page to the browser. Complex tasks such as accessing databases and rendering complex views. CSHTML files can be generated and programmed using Microsoft Visual Studio.",
      "A CSHTML file is a C# HTML webpage file used by Razor, an ASP.NET view engine that generates webpages. It is similar to a standard ASP.NET webpage (.ASP or .ASPX file) but uses slightly different syntax. CSHTML files run on a web server, which generates HTML for a client web browser."
