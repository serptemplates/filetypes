      "The European Broadcasting Union (EBU) developed the BWF format in 1997 to improve standard WAV files by adding metadata for better organization and time synchronization. This feature made BWF a standard among sound engineers, editors, and archivists who required precise synchronization, detailed metadata, and seamless integration within professional workflows."

    "description": [
      "A BWF file is an audio file saved in the Broadcast Wave Format (BWF), which is an extension of the standard WAVE audio format and designed for professional audio production and broadcasting. It stores audio data similarly to a .WAV file but includes metadata in its header, such as timestamps, description tags, and other technical details. By storing this extra information, the format helps with synchronization, editing, and cataloging, making BWF files useful in radio, television, and film production."
