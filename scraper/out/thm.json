      "A THM file is a Thumbnail image automatically created from the first frame of a video file on digital camcorders, cameras, and smartphones. It is generated when a video file is saved by the device camera. The thumbnail preview images from all the videos are displayed to the user for choosing the video of interest from the videos collection. THM files are saved in compressed binary format in memory to reduce space utilization. THM files can be opened with applications such as Apple Preview and Adobe Photoshop 2022.",
      "A THM file is a theme file used by Sony Ericsson mobile phones. It stores settings used to customize the user interface of the cell phone and includes custom window and text colors, icons, wallpaper, and other images. THM files can be created and edited using the free Themes Creator from Sony Ericsson, which is no longer developed."
