      "If you come across a P5D file on your computer you can open it with the Planner 5D program, which is available for Windows, Android, and iOS and as a web program. The P5D file is used by the program to store all of the project contents.",
      "Planner 5D allows you to view your project design as a 2D blueprint or as a 3D model. You can move walls, and place doors, windows, stairs, columns, and other construction elements. The program also allows you to arrange furniture pieces, rugs, curtains, lighting fixtures, and appliances. As you design your layout you can take screenshots and share them via mail or to the OneNote application. P5D projects can be started from scratch or from a template to give you a head start.",
      "NOTE: Planner 5D allows you to begin a project for free but requires purchase to save it (which creates the P5D file). The purchase also provides more interior items to choose from, technical support, and HD snapshots."
