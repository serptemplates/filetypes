      "A KAL file is a data file created by Kratos Vision, a software program used to analyze X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) data. It contains data from multiple spectrums (spectra) recorded by Kratos Analytical instruments. KAL files also store information about the context of the experiment so that it can be reproduced."
