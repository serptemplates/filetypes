      "A file with .jhtml extension is an HTML file with Java code that is executed on server when a client requests this page in a browser. The server processes the requests, executes the Java functions contained in the function, and returns the page to the client’s browser. The Java objects embedded in the JHTML pages run on server to handle requests for pages of this type. JHTML files can also access information from database using the JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) connection. JHTML files can be opened in any text editor and viewed in web browsers such as Google Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.",
      "HTML file that includes Java code; similar to a standard .HTML file, but may include Java functions that are processed on the server before the page is sent to the client's Web browser; can also access information from a database using a JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) connection."
