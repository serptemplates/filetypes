      "A file with .mjpeg (Motion JPEG) extension is a video file that is created by compressing an individual video frame as a JPEG image. It is different from the standard MPEG-1 and MPEG-2 file formats where the compression is interframes and is decided based on the prediction of contents in subsequent frames. MJPEG is supported by a wide range of applications that include web browsers, media players, digital cameras, webcams, streaming servers. Plug-ins are available for applications that want to make use of the MJPEG file format."
