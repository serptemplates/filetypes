      "Illustrators use Clip Studio Paint to create comics, illustrations, and animations. The program saves illustrators' images as CLIP files. CLIP files are layer-based images, which are similar to Adobe Photoshop's .PSD files.",
      "The CLIP format replaced the LIP format in March 2016, with the release of Clip Studio Paint 1.5.4. Notably, CLIP images are usually smaller in size and load more quickly than similar LIP images.",
      "NOTE: Versions 1.5.4 and later of Clip Studio Paint can still open LIP files."
