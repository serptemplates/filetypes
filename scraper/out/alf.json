      "A file with .alf extension is an SQL Transaction log generated by ACT! CRM(Customer Relationship Management) software. It keeps record of activities between the ACT! and SQL, and is used to restore the ACT! database. ACT! CRM stores customer’s information such as name, email address, contact, business information, and relationship history. It stores this information in the ACT! ADF file that stores the data in tables for linking with other modules such as automatic information retrieval for an incoming call. ALF files can be opened with SwiftPage ACT software on Windows OS.",
