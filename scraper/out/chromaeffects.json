      "Razer is an electronics company that specializes in producing high-end gaming PCs and accessories. Many of these devices include LED lights, which users can set to light up and display lights in certain patterns. Users create and apply these patterns using Chroma Studio, an RGB color profile creation tool included with the Razer Synapse hardware management program.",
      "In Synapse 3, Chroma Studio saves users' color profiles as CHROMAEFFECTS files. This file format replaced the RAZERCHROMA format, which Synapse 2's version of Chroma Studio used. CHROMAEFFECTS and RAZERCHROMA files are not interchangeable, so if you want to recreate a Synapse 2 color profile in Synapse 3, you will have to do so manually."
