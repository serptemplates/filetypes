      "ENVI is a geospatial image processing and analysis program that GIS professionals and scientists use to extract information from satellite images of the Earth. As these professionals use ENVI to analyze images, they can add annotations, to call out features, details, or points of interest. These annotations are saved as ANZ files, which are associated with the user's current ENVI session.",
      "To create an annotation, ENVI users select File → New → Annotation Layer from the program's menu bar. Users can create text annotations, line and shape annotations, picture annotations, legends, color bars, scale bars, and image magnifiers. Each annotation a user adds to a session is saved as a separate layer, which can be shown, hidden, edited, or deleted as necessary."
