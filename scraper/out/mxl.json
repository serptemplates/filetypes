      "An MXL file is the compressed form of MusicXML file format that is an open standard format for exchange of digital sheet music. Plain text MusicXML files are large in size and the use of such files as a sheet distribution format was affected with the large file size. This issues was treated with MusicXML 2.0 by introducing the MXL file format that compresses the files enough to reduce the file size similar to that of original MIDI files. Recommended media type for MXL files is application/vnd.recordare.musicxml.",
      "An MXL file is a compressed music score created with MuseScore, a program for music composition and notation. It contains a compressed file saved in the MusicXML format, which is the standard XML format used by more than one hundred score writing programs."
