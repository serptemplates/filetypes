      "A JCWLVL file is a game level used by JellyCar Worlds, a physics-based driving and puzzle game developed by Walaber and published by Disney. It is a renamed Zip-compressed archive that stores the data for a specific level in the game, including the layout of platforms, obstacles, backgrounds, and other elements that make up the course. The JCWLVL format helps keep JellyCar Worlds gameplay consistent and make it behave across platforms as designed."

    "instructions": [
      "JCWLVL files are not meant to be opened. Instead, the JellyCar Worlds game engine references the file and loads it automatically when a player selects a level to play.",
      "However, you can open JCWLVL files with the game's level editor. You can also rename the .jcwlvl file extension to .zip, and extract the contents, like the .JSON data file (lvl.json file), with a Zip utility, such as Corel WinZip or Apple Archive Utility."
