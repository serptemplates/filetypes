      "Sensors are placed in petroleum wells to monitor their activity. These sensors create log data files with the main purpose of determining if a formation contains commercial quantities of hydrocarbons.",
      "One of the formats that well log data files are saved in is the DLIS format. This format was introduced in 1991 and is still used today to interchange well log data. The DLIS format separates data into layers, which consist of media, format, model, schema (descriptions of objects), and dictionary."

      "The .dlis file format is a standard file format for the storage and exchange of well log data in the oil and gas industry. The format was developed by the Logging Industry Data Standard (LIDS) committee and it stands for “Digital Log Information Standard.” The format is designed to store well log data in a way that is easy to read, write and exchange between different systems.\n\nDLIS files contain a set of logical records that describe the well log data and its characteristics, such as the type of log data (e.g. resistivity, gamma ray), the measurement units, and the location of the data in the well. The actual log data is stored in separate binary files and is referenced by the logical records in the DLIS file.",
      "A DLIS file is a log file created by sensors that monitor petroleum wells, which are holes drilled in the ground for the purpose of exchanging petroleum between a subsurface reservoir and the surface. It contains a database of well measurements such as resistivity, porosity, sonic, and magnetic resonance measurements. DLIS files are saved in the Digital Log Interchange Standard for interchanging well log data."
