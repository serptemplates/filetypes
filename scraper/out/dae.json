      "A DAE file is a Digital Asset Exchange file format that is used for exchanging data between interactive 3D applications. This file format is based on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema which is an open standard XML schema for the exchange of digital assets among graphics software applications. It has been adopted by ISO as a publicly available specification, ISO/pAS 17506. DAE files can be opened in applications such as Adobe Photoshop, AutoDesk Maya, AutoDesk AutoCAD, and APIs such as Aspose.CAD.",
      "A DAE file is a 3D interchange file used for exchanging digital assets between a variety of graphics programs. It may contain an image, textures, or most likely, a 3D model. The DAE format is based on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema, which is now owned and developed by Autodesk."

      "You can open DAE files and view their contents in Adobe Photoshop (Windows, Mac) and Apple Preview (Mac). If you want to edit a DAE file, you should open it in an Autodesk application that supports DAE files, such as Autodesk Maya (cross-platform), or Blender (cross-platform).",
      "You can also import DAE files into many applications for use as 3D assets. For example, the ArcGIS suite (Windows) allows users to import and use DAE format assets."
