      "Architects, engineers, and drafters may use 2D files to create, edit, and share design plans. During the drafting process, users can add precise measurements, annotations, and geometric constraints to ensure that the drawing accurately reflects the intended construction or manufacturing plan. They can then review the files before moving forward with a project."
