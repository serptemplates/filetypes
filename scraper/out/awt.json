It contains preset page layout and style settings for a document that allows users to author multiple .ABW documents with the same formatting. AbiWord users often save letters, memos, reports, and other documents they want to replicate as AWT files."

However, opening an AWT file with one of these programs will not display the document like AbiWord.
