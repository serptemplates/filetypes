      "ConeXware PowerArchiver is a utility for compressing, encrypting, and backing up data in Windows and macOS. The utility supports over 60 archive formats, besides the PA format, including .ZIP, .RAR, .7Z, .LZH, .GZIP, and .ARC.",
      "ConeXware introduced the PowerArchiver Advanced Codec Pack format when it released PowerArchiver 2017. The format features two optimized compression modes: 1) \"Optimized Fast\" for faster compression and 2) \"Optimized Strong\" for stronger compression.",
      "PowerArchiver uses the BWTS algorithm to mix data before AES encryption to better secure archives. This encryption method results in archives that are better protected than ZIP and 7Z AES archive formats."

      "A PA file is a compressed archive created by ConeXware PowerArchiver, a utility used to compress, encrypt, and back up data. It stores one or more files compressed with the Advanced Codec Pack (PA) format, which includes various advanced filters and codecs for optimizing compression based on the file type, and may include FIPS 140-2 256-bit AES encryption. PowerArchiver users compress files as PA archives to save space for storage or transportation purposes and secure sensitive information."
