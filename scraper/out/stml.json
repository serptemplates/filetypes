      "A file with .stml extension is a webpage with server side instructions that are executed when a user loads the page in web browser. STML pages contains server side code that contains server side includes to perform tasks that are not possible to achieve with plain HTML. Though similar to HTML, STML offers more power by running the commands on server, also called Server Side Includes (SSI). With the introduction of new programming languages with server side scripting such as PHP, the use of STML is reduced though it is still supported by all server side technologies. STML files can be opened in any text editor and edited for updating the commands.",
      "An STML file is an HTML file that contains Server Side Includes (SSI). It references directives on the server, which dynamically generate content for a webpage. STML files are processed by the server when a user accesses the related webpage. Server Side Include webpages more commonly use the .STM extension."
