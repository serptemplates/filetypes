      "A VCPROJ file is a programming project created by Visual C++, a component of Microsoft Visual Studio for developing C++ programs. It serves as the central file that organizes files in the project, including project settings and references to files used by the project (formatted in the XML standard). Microsoft replaced the VCPROJ file type with the .VCXPROJ format when it released Visual Studio 2010."
