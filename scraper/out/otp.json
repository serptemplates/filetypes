      "You will likely encounter an OTP file only if you use Impress or another OpenOffice user shares a presentation template with you. For example, a co-worker who uses Impress might share an OTP file that contains a branded presentation template with you.",

It contains a presentation, which includes a master slide as well as a content slide with text, images, shapes, multimedia content, transition effects, and other slide elements. Impress users create OTP files to duplicate .ODP presentations with similar appearance and content."
