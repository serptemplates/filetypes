      "SKB files are created by only the Windows version of SketchUp and appear as [filename].skb. The macOS version autosaves models with the .skp extension as [filename]~.skp.",
      "SKB files are typically saved in the \"My Documents\" folder with the original SKP file. However, the location can be changed by selecting Preferences → Files → Models.... SKB files contain the version of the model that was saved before the current version of the model in the SKP file.",

      "An SKB file is a backup document created by the Windows version of SketchUp, a free 3D modeling program. It contains a backup of a .SKP SketchUp 3D model. SKB files are saved automatically using the program's auto-save feature in case the original SKP file becomes corrupted or is accidentally deleted."
