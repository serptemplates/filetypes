      "The SAT extension stands for Standard ACIS Text. As that acronym may have led you to guess, SAT files are stored in an ASCII text format. The data stored within SAT files can also be saved in binary if needed, using the .SAB file format.",
      "NOTE: The SAT format is used across many different industries, including CAD, CAM, CAE, AEC, CMM, 3D animation, and shipbuilding."

      "A SAT file is a 3D model saved in Spatial's ACIS solid modeling format. It stores three-dimensional geometry information in a standard text file format. SAT files are supported by many 3D CAD programs, so they are commonly used to exchange 3D data across programs."

Those who wish to quickly view the 3D model a SAT file contains can upload the file to ShareCAD, a free online CAD file viewer."
