      "An AYT file is a Quran content archive used by Ayat, a cross-platform program that allows users to study the Quran on their computer or mobile device. It stores files, including images, audio, and database files, using a proprietary form of Zip compression. AYT files are also used by King Saud University electronic Quran, the online version of Ayat."

      "Ayat automatically loads all necessary AYT files when you start the program. So if you have access to Ayat, you should not need to manually open an AYT file.",
      "However, you may have difficulty installing Ayat on computers using modern operating systems. If you want to access the files contained within an AYT archive without using Ayat, you can rename the AYT file to use the .ZIP extension. Then, you can extract the files contained within the ZIP archive and open them as you would any image, audio, or database file."
