      "Automator enables the user to bypass programming normally required to create automations. The user can easily create .WORKFLOW documents by building individual actions into a complete task by dragging and dropping them into an Automator workflow. Automator gives the user the ability to repeat tasks in different programs, such as the Address Book, iCal and the Safari web browser.",
