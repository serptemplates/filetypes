      "A file with .bml extension is a Bean Markup Language file that stores Java classes for supporting Java apps. This allows access to Java objects and methods, and doesn’t need to create new functionality using Java classes. It specifies how the components are connected to each other for performing useful tasks. BML was developed by IBM alphaWorks to describe the structures and components relationships. BML files can be opened and viewed using any text editor such as Web Browsers, Microsoft Notepad and Notepad++.",
      "A BML file is a webpage written in the Bean Markup Language (BML). BML is based on the Bean Scripting Framework (BSF), which is a set of Java classes that provide scripting language support within Java applications."
