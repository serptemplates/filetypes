      "The GandCrab V4 virus is ransomware, where the purpose of the virus is to take your computer files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator (typically via bitcoin) to unlock your files. The virus is a trojan horse that is commonly introduced through fake blogs that provide cracked software. Users download and install the software, which is actually the GandCrab V4 virus that scrambles, renames, and encrypts the user's files. The virus then generates a .TXT ransom note (KRAB-DECRYPT.txt) informing you of the takeover and what you need to do to recover your files."
