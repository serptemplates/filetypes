      "Gallery uses THUMBDATA3-1763508120 to cache information about images it has indexed. This caching helps Gallery load images more quickly and reduces lag time when displaying thumbnails.",
      "The more images you have in your Gallery app, the larger your THUMBDATA3-1763508120 file will become. If you have a large number of thumbnail images in Gallery, your THUMBDATA3-1763508120 may become several GBs in size. The file increases in size every time a new image is added. Also, when you delete an image, that image's indexed properties remain in the file.",
      "To reduce a THUMBDATA3-1763508120 file's size, remove images from your Gallery app and then delete the THUMBDATA3-1763508120 file. Gallery will automatically regenerate the file, but the file will contain data for only the images still in the app.",
      "If you do not want to remove images from your device, delete THUMBDATA3-1763508120 and create a new file in the same sdcard/DCIM/.thumbnails folder using a file explorer, such as File Viewer for Android. Then, name the file .thumbdata3-1763508120. This will stop Gallery from recreating THUMBDATA3-1763508120.",
