      "NOTE: FileMaker Pro 12 uses the newer .FMP12 format for databases. FP7 databases can be upgraded to the newer format simply by opening them in FileMaker Pro 12, which automatically converts them (and saves a backup copy of the FP7 file in the process). FileMaker Pro 5 and 6 use the .FP5 extension."

FP7 files have the capability to store large data including personal databases data and organizational records. A more newer version of FileMaker Pro is FMP12 that was introduced with the launch of FileMake Pro version 12. In addition to textual data, the FP7 file may also hold forms, charts, and other database objects. FP7 files can be opened with FileMaker Pro Advanced.",
