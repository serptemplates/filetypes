      "Hiro Systems PBC developed Clarity and introduced it in 2020 alongside Stacks 2.0. Unlike many smart contract languages, Clarity is decidable, meaning users can analyze contract outcomes before execution. Clarity is also interpreted rather than compiled, which helps reduce security risks.",
      "Additionally, Clarity enforces transparent and predictable execution by disallowing reentrancy and hidden control flows. This design makes CLAR files useful for creating verifiable and secure smart contracts, reducing vulnerabilities commonly found in other blockchain environments."

      "A CLAR file contains Clarity smart contract code, a programming language developers use to write and deploy smart contracts on the Stacks blockchain development. It stores code defining how a smart contract should work, including rules for transactions and data management. CLAR files are commonly used in decentralized applications (dApps) and financial services built on Stacks, which connects to the Bitcoin blockchain."

      "You can open CLAR files with various source code editors, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code and Brackets.io Brackets. To open a CLAR file with Visual Studio Code, select File → Open.",
      "Since CLAR files are saved in plain text, you can also open and edit them with a basic text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit. However, simple text editors do not come with features included with source code editors that make it easier for developers to code."
