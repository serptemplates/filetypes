      "Gel electrophoresis is used to separate and analyze macromolecules, such as DNA and RNA, and their fragments. GeneSnap is developed as an advanced image acquisition program for scientists that enables them to capture, archive, and manipulate electrophoretic gel images. It is included in every Syngene gel documentation and analysis system.",
