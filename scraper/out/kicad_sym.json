      "Engineers, hobbyists, and educators working with electronic design automation (EDA) tools are the most likely users to encounter KICAD_SYM files. KiCad uses the files to organize components and display them in a way that is easy to browse and reuse across multiple projects. Users can also share symbol libraries by distributing KICAD_SYM files, which helps standardize component definitions within teams or communities."

    "description": [
      "A KICAD_SYM file is a library created by KiCad, an open-source program for designing electronic circuits and printed circuit boards (PCBs). It contains one or more schematic symbols, which are the visual representations of electronic components such as resistors, capacitors, and integrated circuits, and are placed on a circuit schematic to show how components connect and interact. KICAD_SYM files store information in a text format and may include information about pins, names, and categories."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open KICAD_SYM files with KiCad (version 5 and later). To open a KICAD_SYM file, select Preferences → Manage Symbol Libraries, and on the Global Libraries tab, click the folder icon to add the library.",
      "Since KICAD_SYM files store information in text format, you can open the files with text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, and Microsoft Visual Studio Code. However, opening the files with a text editor will not appear the same as opening them with KiCad."
