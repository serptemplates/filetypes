      "OUT files are most commonly seen as a.out files. The name stands for \"assembler output\" and is a format used by the PDP-7 and PDP-11 series of minicomputers. The \"a.out\" filename may also be given to OUT files not saved in the \"assembler output\" format but instead is just the default name given to output files when no name is applied."
