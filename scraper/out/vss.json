      "Microsoft Visio is primarily utilized in business settings to create workflow diagrams, organizational charts, business flowcharts, database models, and software and network diagrams. Visio comes with VSS files pre-installed, and users may create them, as well.",
      "The VSS format was more common in the 2000s when Visio saved stencils as VSS files by default. However, Microsoft replaced VSS files (binary-based) with the .VSSX format (Zip-based) when it released Visio 2013. Visio 2013 and later versions still support VSS files."
