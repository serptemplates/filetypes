      "The UNF ROM file is saved in the Universal NES Image Format (UNIF) as an alternative for storing NES and Famicom images. It was originally developed by Tennessee Carmel-Veilleux but then abandoned in 2008. In 2011, the UNIF format was then added to the libunif project and has since been maintained.",
