      "An MGC file is a media catalog used by Microsoft Clip Organizer, a tool included with older versions of Microsoft Office. It stores a collection of clip art, images, and media resources to organize and manage media assets that users can access and insert into Office documents or presentations. MGC files are obscure since Microsoft Clip Organizer is not included with modern versions of Office."
