      "AT&T Bell Laboratories developed the TAR archive format in 1979. TAR files typically contain multiple files packaged together for easier storage and sharing, including storing a library of digital photographs or distributing software packages.",
      "However, TAR files are not compressed. To reduce the size of TAR archives, users can choose from various compression algorithms, such as GNU Zip (gzip) or Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain Algorithm (LZMA), that result in .TAR.GZ and .TAR.LZMA files. Additionally, compressing a TAR archive with the Zip algorithm may result in a TAR.ZIP file or ZIP file."

      "A TAR.ZIP file is a Unix Tape Archive (.TAR file) compressed with the Zip algorithm. It contains one or more files packaged together to reduce their size, making them easier to store or transfer. Various utilities may compress TAR files as TAR.ZIP files, but users may also compress TAR archives as .ZIP files and then manually rename them from .zip to .tar.zip."
