      "Mozilla browsers, including Firefox, support XUL to build both the main browser interface and add-ons or extensions. Because XUL is based on XML, it is both human-readable and machine-readable, making it easier for developers to create and modify interfaces.",
      "XUL files work together with other technologies, such as JavaScript and CSS, to provide interactive and styled user experiences. For example, CSS applies styling to elements defined in an XUL file (e.g., colors, fonts, and sizes), and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to them (e.g., click response or fetching and displaying data without reloading the interface).",
      "Users who interact with XUL files are mostly software developers and extension creators who work on customizing Mozilla-based browsers or building standalone applications that rely on the Gecko rendering engine. While most users don't directly open or edit XUL files, these files are essential for determining the software's appearance and functionality."

      "A file with a .xul extension (XUL stands for XML User Interface Language) is an XML based markup language file for creating user interfaces. It was developed by Mozilla for developers to create graphical user interface elements similar to other markup languages used for creating web pages. XUL has been widely in use by Mozilla in its Firefox browser where it used the Mozilla codebase. XUL rendering is carried out using the Gecko engine. Firefox forks such as Pale Moon, Basilisk, and Waterfox retain support for XUL add-ons. XUL files are identified with MIME type: application/vnd.mozilla.xul+xml.",
      "An XUL file is a file used to create user interface elements for applications, primarily within Mozilla products like the Firefox web browser. It is saved in the XML User Interface Language (XUL), which is a simple markup language in the XML standard that defines windows, menus, buttons, and other interface components. XUL files allow developers to design the layout and behavior of an application's interface in a clear and structured way."
