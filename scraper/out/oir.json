      "Scientists use the Olympus FV3000 to examine and create detailed, laser-scanned images of scientific specimens. For example, a biologist might use the FV3000 to image a portion of an animal's brain.",
      "Images created using the FV3000 are saved as OIR files. Typically, each OIR file contains a complete image (which may be tiled to allow for detailed analysis). However, when creating an image larger than 1 GB, the FV3000 splits the image into multiple OIR files. To see the entirety of a split image, you must load all associated OIR files (e.g. for a split image that consists of two files, you must load both Example.oir and Example_00001.oir])."
