      "The DX Series Exported Video File with “.exp” extension is a proprietary file format associated with the DX Series digital video recorders (DVRs) manufactured by certain vendors, such as DX4100 or DX4800.\n\nThe “.exp” file format is used to store surveillance video footage recorded by these DVRs. It typically employs MPEG-4 compression to efficiently encode the video data while maintaining reasonable quality. In addition to the video stream, the file also contains metadata that provides important information about the recording, such as the date and time of the footage, camera number, video format, and recording mode.\n\nTo view or work with DX Series exported video files, it is recommended to use the manufacturer’s provided software or compatible third-party applications designed to support this file format. These applications are typically capable of decoding the video stream and providing tools for playback, analysis, and management of the surveillance footage.",
      "An EXP file is a symbols export file, produced by an integrated development environment (IDE) or compiler. It contains binary information about exported data and functions. EXP files are used to link the program they were created from with another program."

      "EXP is a proprietary file format originating from surveillance cameras. Due to its proprietary nature, there are no available applications designed specifically for converting EXP files. The recommended approach is to utilize the built-in player provided by the surveillance camera system to play EXP files. It is important to note that the EXP file format lacks compatible codecs, players, or converters. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the dedicated player provided by the security camera system to access and view these files."
