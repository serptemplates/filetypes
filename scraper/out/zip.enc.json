      "Facebook contains a Download Your Information feature that allows users to download a copy of the information associated with their Facebook account. When a user downloads their information, Facebook creates one or more .ZIP files that include numerous other data files. Each data file includes a portion of the user's Facebook data.",
      "Sometimes, the ZIP archive(s) the Download Your Information feature produces mistakenly contains a ZIP.ENC file. This file contains data that was not processed properly during the data retrieval and download process, and is mistakenly encrypted. For example, if your ZIP archive does not include a copy of your Facebook messages, but does include a ZIP.ENC file, the ZIP.ENC file may contain an encrypted copy of your messages.",
      "If you receive a ZIP.ENC file when downloading your data from Facebook, you should attempt to download your data again. Typically, the Download Your Information feature does not produce ZIP.ENC files. If the problem persists, you should contact Facebook support."
