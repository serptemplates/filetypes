      "In 1991, developer Teijo Kinnunen and publisher RBF Software released OctaMED, a follow-up to the popular MED sound tracker. While MED used only .MED files to store sounds, OctaMED used both MED and 8MED files to do the same.",
      "OctaMED was notable for being able to play eight-channel audio on the Commodore Amiga's four-channel sound chip. While OctaMED was ported to Windows in the late 1990s (under the name MED Soundstudio), it is no longer developed or maintained."

      "An 8MED file is a music file created by OctaMED, a sound tracker for the Commodore Amiga. It contains notes, pitches, and effects used to create music tracks and sound sequences. No known programs support 8MED files."

      "Because 8MED files are so old, no known programs currently support 8MED files. Both VLC media player and OpenMPT can play MED files, so it's possible those programs may support 8MED files in the future."
