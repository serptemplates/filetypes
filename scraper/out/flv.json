      "FLV files consist of Header and Packets. An FLV file starts with the Header. The header has the following fields.\n\nSignature: Its value is FLVVersion: Its default value is 1. Only 0x01 is valid.Flags: 0x04 is used for audio and 0x01 is used for video so 0x05 is used for both audio and video.Header Size: The default value is 9. It is used to skip a newer expanded header.\n\nAfter the header comes the Packets. The FLV file is split into multiple packets called FLV tags that have 15-byte headers. The packets contain the metadata for audio, video, scripts, encryption information, and payload. The FLV packets have the following fields.\n\nReserved: It is reserved for FMS and should be 0.Filter: Indicates whether the packets are filtered or not.0: No preprocessing required. This is used for unencrypted files.1: Preprocessing required. This is used for encrypted filesPacket Type: This defines the type of content in the packet.8: Audio9: Video18: Script DataData Size: This denotes the length of the message.Timestamp Lower: This stores the timestamp in milliseconds at which the tag data applies. It is set to NULL for the first packet.Timestamp Upper: Extension to create a uint32_be value.Stream ID: This is set to NULL for the first stream.Payload Data: This is the data based on the packet type.",
      "The FLV format was introduced with the release of Adobe Flash Player 7 in 2003. It is primarily utilized by Adobe Flash Player for delivering video content, such as movies and TV shows, online. However, FLV is an open format that is also supported by various non-Adobe/Macromedia programs.",
      "Users may create Flash Video content and export it as FLV files with the Flash Video Exporter plug-in (included with Adobe Animate) or another program with FLV file support. Users can also encode other video formats, such as QuickTime or Windows Media with Adobe Media Encoder.",
      "As web technologies improved in the 2010s, Flash became increasingly criticized for its shortcomings, which included performance and security issues. Eventually, the use of Flash Player and the FLV format declined, and Adobe and many web browser developers officially ended support for Flash on December 31, 2020.",
      "NOTE: Animate was formerly known as Flash, which was originally developed by Macromedia but then merged with Adobe in 2005. Flash became Animate in 2016."
