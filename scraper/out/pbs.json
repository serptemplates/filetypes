      "PixBuilder Studio allows users to import and edit images using layer-based editing tools. For example, a user could import an image, adjust its color balance, add a new layer that contains text, and then save their edited image.",
      "If a user wants to preserve their edited image's layers, they can save the image as a PBS file. This allows the user to reload their image and edit each layer individually at a later time.",
      "Alternatively, users can save images they've edited in PixBuilder Studio as BMP, PNG, JPG, GIF, TIFF, PCX, or TGA files. However, saving an image in any of these formats flattens the image into a single layer. So, if a user saves their image in one of these file formats, they will not be able to continue editing the image's layers."
