      "Typically, users never see APK files because Android handles app installation in the background via Google Play or another app distribution platform. However, many websites offer direct APK file downloads for Android users who want to install apps manually. In this case, you should be careful that you trust the source of the APK file, because malware can be distributed in APK files, just as it can in the case of Windows and .EXE files.",

      "Windows 11 is the first version of Windows to officially support the ability to install APK files. Windows 11 users can manually install APK files using Windows Subsystem for Android in combination with Android Debug Bridge. As of early 2022, this feature is available to only members of the Windows Insider Program. It also requires that users enable the Hyper-V and Virtual Machine Platform features in Windows settings.",

It is created as an executable file using the official IDE Google Android Studio, and is uploaded to Google Play store to be downloaded and installed by end users. APK files can be generated and made available for manual installation as well prior to publishing to Google Play store. This helps in testing the functionality and behaviour of the generated APK package file. Therefore, one needs to be sure that the APK file is from a trusted source and does not contain any malware.",
