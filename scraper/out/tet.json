If a developer wants to change the way the script editor highlights scripts' syntax (i.e. the colors the script editor uses to highlight declarations, commands, and functions), they can do so by applying a different theme to the script editor. Godot script editor themes are saved in TET files, which are stored in the following locations on users' PCs:",
