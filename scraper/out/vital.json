      "Vital is a cross-platform synthesizer program developed by Matt Tytel. Vital allows musicians to record music, typically using an electronic musical keyboard, and mimic all sorts of instruments and sounds as they do so.",
      "To give users a starting point from which to begin recording music, Vital contains several pre-made settings files designed to mimic specific instruments and musical styles. These presets are saved in VITAL files. For example, Vital comes preinstalled with VITAL files named Growl Bass Sidechain.vital and Digestive Trauma.vital, among many others. Vital users also regularly create and share their own VITAL files. Oftentimes, users group VITAL files within VITALBANK files, which can be used to install many VITAL files at once."
