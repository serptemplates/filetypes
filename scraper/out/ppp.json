      "Serif PagePlus was a long-running desktop publishing program available for Windows. Serif released the first version of PagePlus in 1990.",
      "Throughout its many versions, PagePlus saved users' documents as PPP files. The PPP format changed over time, making some versions of PPP files incompatible with some versions of PagePlus. However, every PPP file contains some sort of document created using a version of PagePlus, such as a report, flyer, or manuscript. PagePlus users can also export PPP files as .PDF files, email messages, and webpages.",
      "Serif released the last version of PagePlus, PagePlus X9, in November 2015. In 2017, Serif replaced PagePlus with a new desktop publishing program, named Affinity Publisher.",

      "A PPP file is a graphics project file created with NCH PhotoPad Editor Software. It comprises of the edited image in PhotoPad along with the record of all the edits made to different components (such as layers, text, adjustments) of that image. This lets you revert to a previous editing stage and start editing from that point. PPP Project files can be opened in PhotoPad software and can be exported to popular image file formats such as JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, and PSD.",
      "A PPP file is a document created by Serif PagePlus, a British desktop publishing program for Windows. It may contain text, images, charts, tables, and multiple pages. The PPP file format was discontinued in 2017, when Serif replaced PagePlus with Affinity Publisher."
