      "The VCF format is widely used for exchanging contact information between applications and devices. For example, you may export a person's contact information as a VCF file, then import it into a contact-organizing program on your computer.",
      "Since VCF files are relatively small in size, you can attach a file to an email message and send it to yourself or other contacts. They can then import the contact information in the VCF into their own contact-organizing software, often by simply double-clicking the file.",
      "You may create VCF files from scratch by creating a new contact and exporting it. For example, in Microsoft Outlook, you can create a contact, then select File → Save As to create a VCF file.",
      "Or, you can convert other file formats to the VCF format. For example, you can save .XLS or .XLSX files as .CSV files with Microsoft Excel, then convert them to VCF files with a simple converter program, such as \"CSV to vCard.\"",

      "A VCF file is a standard file format for storing contact information for one or more persons or a business. It typically includes a name, address, phone number, email address, and other contact information. VCF files also support custom fields, images, and other types of media."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open VCF files with various applications. Windows users can open vCards with Windows Contacts and Microsoft People (bundled with Windows) and Microsoft Outlook (an email client included with Microsoft Office). Mac users can open vCards with the Contacts application included with macOS or the third-party Flexibits Cardhop app. Android and iOS users can also load vCards directly into the Contacts apps bundled with their respective operating systems.",
      "Since vCards are saved in a text format, you can also open them with a plain text editor. However, the files may also include a block of binary data, which is often used to store a photo. Also, the information in the file will not be displayed the same as if it was opened in a contacts program."
