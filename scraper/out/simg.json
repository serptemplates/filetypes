      "An SIMG file is a disk image file saved in the proprietary Synclavier Disk Image (SIMG) format. It stores a collection of sounds used to compose music with SynclavierX, a digital synthesizer program. SIMG files are designed to be mounted by SynclavierX to allow users to access all their songs in one file without having to load multiple files."
