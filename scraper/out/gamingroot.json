      "The Xbox and Game Bar apps automatically generate GAMINGROOT files when they recognize a drive suitable for game data. These files are typically very small, usually less than one kilobyte in size, but play an essential role in ensuring that your games are installed and run correctly on the designated drive.",

      "A GAMINGROOT file is a hidden system file used by the Xbox and Game Bar apps on Windows 10 or 11 to indicate that a particular drive is suitable for game installation. When these apps identify a drive as appropriate for storing games, they automatically create a GAMINGROOT file on it. GAMINGROOT files are unnamed and appear as .GamingRoot. Users should not delete these files since doing so could prevent games from functioning properly."
