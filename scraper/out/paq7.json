      "PAQ is a \"data compression archiver\" available for Windows and Linux. Developer Matt Mahoney released the first version of PAQ in 2002. Mahoney released the seventh version of PAQ, better known as PAQ7, in 2005.",
      "PAQ7's compression algorithms differ significantly from previous versions' algorithms. Notably, PAQ7 compresses .BMP, .TIFF, and .JPEG files more efficiently than previous versions. PAQ7 also compresses files three times more quickly than PAQ6 and its variants."
