      "Gamers who enjoy playing retro, discontinued games for the NDS on their computers may use NDS files. The gamers may create NDS files by dumping the game data from the original cartridge onto a computer and packaging it as an NDS file. Gamers may also download NDS files from game emulator websites already dumped from game cartridges.",
