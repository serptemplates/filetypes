      "FXA files are designed to only store the information necessary for the animation. Therefore, they do not store any FaceFX-specific project data. This helps the files be lightweight and consume fewer resources when being played back in a game.",
      "FaceFX animations are used by popular games such as StarCraft II: Wings of Liberty, Mass Effect 2, and Assassin's Creed 2.",
      "NOTE: FXA files were used by FaceFX 1.0 - 1.7.x. They have been replaced by .FACEFX files in FaceFX 2009 and later."
