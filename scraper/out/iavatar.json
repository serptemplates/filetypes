      "iClone is a 3D animation program available for Windows, used to create animated videos for films and video games. Notably, iClone is often used to create precise facial and lip-sync animations.",
      "Animators can use default iClone characters, create new characters using the program itself, or create characters using iClone's accompanying Character Creator. All these characters are saved as IAVATAR files. For example, a Character Creator user can select File → Export → iAvatar to export a character as an IAVATAR file. While exporting the character, the user can select the character's max texture size and detail quality.",
