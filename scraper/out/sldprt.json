      "In SolidWorks, engineers and product designers create 3D models that represent manufactured products. For example, an automotive engineer might use SolidWorks to create a prototype of a new steering system.",
      "The models SolidWorks users create are typically comprised of many smaller components. These components are saved as SLDPRT files.",
      "Users can create, import, and modify SLDPRT files independent of the larger assemblies in which they are included. For example, a user can open an SLDPRT file in its own window and modify its geometry. SolidWorks will then automatically apply the modifications to any assemblies that include that SLDPRT file. Users can also render an SLDPRT file's contents as a 2D drawing (.SLDDRW file)."
