      "A nonogram puzzle, which is similar to a griddler, paint-by-numbers, or hanjie puzzle, is a puzzle that consists of cells in a grid that must be colored or left blank in order to reveal a picture. The puzzle contains numbers for each grid row and column that indicate the number of colored square sets. You must choose which squares are colored and which squares are blank based on the numbers provided in order to solve the puzzle and reveal the image.",
