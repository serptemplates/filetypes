      "Wyze Labs specializes in developing cameras, including outdoor camera floodlights and doorbells. The cameras have ports into which you can insert microSD cards to save MP4 video recordings and related LOG and KMSG files. To transfer video from the cameras (and related LOG and KMSG files), you can eject the microSD card from the camera and insert it into your computer."

      "A KMSG file is a data file created by Wyze cameras that stores information about .MP4 video recordings captured by the cameras. The files typically accompany .LOG files on microSD cards inserted into the cameras. When users transfer a microSD card from the camera to their computer, they may encounter the KMSG file in the log folders (e.g., \"log_0000\" and \"log_0000 2\" folders)."
