      "A PowerDesigner Database File, also known as .pdm file, is a file format used by PowerDesigner software from SAP. PowerDesigner is a data modeling and design tool that is used to create and manage database models, business process models and other types of models.\n\nThe .pdm file contains database model created using PowerDesigner, including tables, relationships, keys, and other metadata related to the database structure. The file format is specific to PowerDesigner and can only be opened and edited using the PowerDesigner software.\n\nThe .pdm file can be used to generate database schema scripts, to forward-engineer a database or to reverse-engineer existing database into PowerDesigner model. The file format is also used for collaboration, as it allows multiple users to work on same database model at the same time and merge changes together.\n\nThe .pdm file is a key component of PowerDesigner software, allowing users to design and manage complex database models efficiently and effectively.",
      "Database created with Sybase PowerDesigner, an enterprise modeling and design program; stores database information as well as references to other files, such as the database definition (.XDB) file and model definition (.XEM) files."
