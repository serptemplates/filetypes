      "A RAY file is typically created from measurements of real light sources or a ray sensor collecting light ray data. Synopsys programs, such as LightTools and LucidShape, use RAY files to import light ray data to simulate the effects of light in various systems, such as automotive lighting, projectors, and solar lighting."

      "A RAY file is a data file created by Synopsys illumination design programs, such as LightTools and LucidShape. It contains data about light rays, which may range from a couple thousand light rays to millions of light rays, and include wavelength, colors, and origination. RAY files are used to simulate the appearance of actual light rays."
