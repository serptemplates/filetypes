      "Softree Technical Systems publishes several CAD programs used by civil engineers, forest engineers, and surveyors. For example, civil engineers can use Softree RoadEng to plan road, rail, or pipeline construction projects, and surveyors can use Softree TerrainTools (also included with RoadEng) to import geographic survey data and create topographic maps.",
      "The terrain maps that Softree's CAD programs use are saved as TERX files. These files contain geographic features, points, formatting, and annotations. They can be viewed as 2D or 3D files. Typically, Softree users create TERX files in a program's Terrain module and then reference them in RoadEng's Location module (.DSNX file) or another Terrain project."

      "To reference a TERX file in TerrainTools, use the background options found in Plan Options on the program’s Plan tab. Various functions, such as volume calculation, offer an option to browse for a reference TERX file.",
      "To reference a TERX file in RoadEng's Location module, either reference the file while creating a new project, or reference the file using the background options found in Plan Options on the program's Plan tab."
