      "In 1986, German software publisher Scanntronik released the Printfox word processor for the Commodore 64. Printfox allowed users to combine text and images to be printed upon an A4 sheet of paper. Most often, users who wanted to add images to their document created them using Printfox's graphics editor, which saved images as BS files.",
      "In 1987, Scanntronik released an updated version of Printfox, called Pagefox. While Pagefox saved images as PG files, it also allowed users to load and use BS files.",
      "NOTE: Printfox Bitmap Images can also be saved as GB files, which contain a 640 x 400 pixel image."
