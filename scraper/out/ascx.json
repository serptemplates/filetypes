      "A file with .ascx extension is a user control that is used as a reusable component in webpages. It is referenced in any ASP website by dragging it from the control box to the page. ASCX users controls are added to the project as a central source, resulting in any change in the user control to be reflected across the whole website. Unlike ASMX files which define a mechanism to communicate within 2 objects over the internet, ASCX files are user controls for embedding in pages or website.",
      "An ASCX file is a webpage that can be used as a component of other webpages. For example, a navigation bar called navbar.ascx might be referenced by all pages within an ASP-driven website. A single change to the navbar.ascx file would then change the navigation bar on all the website's other pages."
