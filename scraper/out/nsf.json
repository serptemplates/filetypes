      "Developer Kevin Horton created the NSF format to allow NES enthusiasts to save and transfer NES music data in a compact, easy-to-use format. Using various ripping tools, gamers can extract all a game's music and package it in a single NSF file. Each NSF file also contains a small file header, which details various metadata (such as the name of the game from which the file was created).",
      "Often, gamers share NSF files they've created from NES games online, to allow other gamers to download and listen to that music in a media player. However, some chiptune music enthusiasts enjoy creating their own NSF music, using NES music composition programs such as FamiTracker and BleuBleu FamiStudio."

      "A file with .nsf (Notes Storage Facility) extension is a database file format used by the IBM Notes software, which was previously known as Lotus Notes. It defines the schema to store different kind of objects such like emails, appointments, documents, forms and views. All this information is contained in a single NSF file for business collaboration similar to a PST/OST file. Some of the applications that can open NSF files include IBM Lotus Notes and IBM Domino.",
      "An NSF file is an audio file saved in the NES Sound Format. It likely contains music exported from a Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) game. However, some NSF files contain original compositions, created by NES and chiptune enthusiasts using various music trackers."
