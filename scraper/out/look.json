      "Adobe developed SpeedGrade to enable filmmakers, editors, and visual effects artists to color grade their productions more accurately. The software integrates with other video editing applications, such as Premiere Pro and After Effects.",
      "You can adjust the coloring of videos to give them a look and feel, such as adding blues for sadness, reds for intensity, and oranges for warmth. Then, when you want to save the color grading settings you have applied, you can save them as LOOK files.",
      "To save a look as a LOOK file, grade the color of a video, click the \"Save Look\" icon in the Look tab on the lower-right corner of the Layers panel. The look should then appear in the Look browser and is saved in the following directory based on the computer platform:",
      "Windows - [user]\\​Application Data\\​Adobe\\​SpeedGrade\\​settings\\​looks\\​",
      "macOS - [user]/​Library/​Application Support/​Adobe/​SpeedGrade/​settings/​looks/​",

      "A LOOK file is a color corrections data file exported by SpeedGrade, a color grading program used in video production. It contains a 3D lookup table (LUT) in XML formatting that includes all color corrections made to a video. SpeedGrade users can apply LOOK files to their video projects non-destructively to adjust the color as they edit them."

      "Since Adobe discontinued SpeedGrade in 2017, you may be unable to access the application. However, you can also open LOOK files with the Lumetri Color tools available in Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop (Windows and macOS)."
