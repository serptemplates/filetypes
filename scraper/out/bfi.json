      "Tsunami Media described the method they used to produce video files as \"Brute Force & Ignorance,\" leading to the files' .bfi designation. The company's developers wanted gamers to be able to play Tsunami games without shelling out for new hardware, so they designed the BFI file format to be played back easily by most PCs.",
      "In 1993 and 1994, Tsunami released Blue Force and Flash Traffic: City of Angels. Both games contained BFI cutscenes. Tsunami released only a handful of additional games before closing its doors in 1996."
