      "When you install a new version of iOS on your iPhone, iPad, or other iOS device, your device generates an SHSH2 file. Apple's servers read this SHSH2 file, which is sent as a digital signature, to verify that the version of iOS you are installing is current, and therefore allowed to be installed.",
      "Most iOS users will never actually encounter an SHSH2 file. However, those who want to revert to a previous, unsigned version of iOS (likely to jailbreak their device) will need to manually generate an SHSH2 file. Websites such as TSS Saver and SHSH Host allow users to save and generate SHSH2 files, using their device's ECID and model identifier.",
