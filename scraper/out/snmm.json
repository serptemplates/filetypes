      "Samsung Smart Switch is the official backup app used to transfer a user's contacts, photos, settings, call history, and other data from one Samsung Galaxy phone to another. When creating a backup, Smart Switch creates several encrypted files, each of which contains a portion of the user's phone data. Smart Switch then stores the encrypted files in a Smart Switch/​Backup folder on the user's phone or PC.",
      "One of the files a Smart Switch backup contains is an SNMM file. This file contains a copy of the notes a user has created in Samsung Notes. However, the file is saved in a proprietary, non-human-readable format. Therefore, you cannot simply open the file to read or retrieve your notes."
