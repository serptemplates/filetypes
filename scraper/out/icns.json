      "An icon format used by macOS programs is called an ICNS file. It allows 1-bit and 8-bit alpha bands and saves one or more pictures, usually made from PNG documents. The program icon in the macOS browser and interface is displayed using ICNS files.\n\nBased on the location, the same style icon can have multiple settings. The ICNS format has undergone numerous alterations and has evolved to the point where it may now be used as the foundation for various compatible formats. Here are some other important points you need to know:\n\nIconFamily Resource, Macintosh Icon, Macintosh OS X Icon, Mac OS Icon, Apple Icon, Mac OS X Icon Resource, and Mac OS icons Resource are some of the other names.For icon information, a source in the resource branch is used.In most cases, a file contains numerous images. 1612 pixels square and 1024, 512, 256, 128, 48, 32, and 16 pixels square are supported picture sizes.",
      "An ICNS file is an icon used by a macOS application. It contains one or more images of varying sizes, saved in the .TIFF format. ICNS files are primarily used as application icons and file type icons, which appear in the macOS Finder, desktop, and dock."
