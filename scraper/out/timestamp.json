      "A TIMESTAMP file is a data file created by ESRI mapping software, such as ArcMap or ArcCatalog. It contains information about edits that have been made to a file geodatabase (.GDB file), which stores geographic information. TIMESTAMP files should never be modified or deleted, otherwise the geodatabase it is associated with will become corrupt."
