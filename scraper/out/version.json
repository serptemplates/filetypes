To help players manage their mods and KSP installations, KSP Add-on Version Checker (KSP-AVC) uses VERSION files to check that a mod is compatible with a player's version of KSP. KSP-AVC and other mod managers can also use VERSION files to retrieve, install, and update mods from the download locations listed in the files."
