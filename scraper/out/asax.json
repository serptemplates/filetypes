      "A file with .asax extension is a file used by ASP.NET applications that resides on the server side. It contains code for responding to application-level and session-level events raised by ASP.NET or by HTTP modules. This also includes handling certain events when the application launches or shuts down. ASAX files are optional and only a single ASAX file is added to web applications to handle the application-level events and errors at the global level. Unlike ASPX pages, ASAX files do not contain any code to implement the functionality of the application.",
      "File used by ASP.NET Web applications; contains program code that is used to respond to application-level events raised by ASP.NET or HttpModules; parsed and compiled at application runtime; used for handling events during application initialization and shutdown, as well as processing global exceptions and errors."
