      "The PCIDSK file format was created by PCI Geomatics in 1988. It was designed as a replacement for the UNIDSK format, which was dependent on 16-bit architectures and was unable to scale to 32-bit and 64-bit systems. The PCIDSK format includes more flexibility for storing new data requirements.",
      "Geomatica can be used for remote sensing, geospatial analysis, digital photogrammetry, map production, mosaicking, and automated product system functions. Geomatica is available in Core and Prime editions."
