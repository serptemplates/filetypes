      "Graphic designers, photographers, and illustrators use GIMP to edit and create raster graphics. The software supports various tools for photo retouching, digital painting, and graphic design. It also supports plugins, enabling users to extend its capabilities with custom features and automation scripts.",
      "Because XCF files store full editing information, they can become large in size. To help manage this, GIMP supports file compression when saving XCF images, using options like gzip, bzip2, or XZ to reduce file size, which is especially useful for backups or sharing working files.",
      "NOTE: XCF stands for eXperimental Computing Facility, the name of the student computing group at UC Berkeley where GIMP was originally developed."

      "An XCF file is the native image format used by GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program), a free, open-source image editor. It stores all the elements of a working image in GIMP, including layers, channels, paths, selections, guides, and text. XCF files enable users to save their entire editing progress and resume work on the image later without losing any data."
