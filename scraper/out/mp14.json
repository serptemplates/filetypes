      "The MP14 file is one of the main file types associated with Multisim, along with the MS14 file. To create an MP14 file, select File → Projects and packing → New project... and choose the location to save the MP14 file. The MP14 will be created and stored in a project folder in the save location you chose. To open an MP14 file, simply double-click the MP14 file or select File → Projects and packing → Open project....",
      "Multisim appends a number to project file extensions, which indicates the Multisim version that created the project. For example, Multisim 12 creates the .MP12 file extension and Multisim 13 creates the .MP13 file extension. Also, Multisim supports older project formats, which means that version 14 of Multisim can still open an .MP8 project created by version 8 of Multisim."

      "An MP14 file is a project created by version 14 of Multisim, a program used to analyze, design, and simulate circuits. It contains simulation results, reports, documents, and references to one or more circuit designs stored in .MS14 files. MP14 files are used to organize MS14 designs in one project."
