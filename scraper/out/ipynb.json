      "IPYNB notebooks are plain text files formatted using JSON, making them human-readable and easy to share with others. Oftentimes, scientists will host their IPYNB files online at publicly-accessible URLs. This allows other Jupyter Notebook users to either:",

It contains all the content from a Jupyter Notebook web application session, including computation inputs and outputs, mathematical functions, images, and explanatory text. IPYNB files can be exported to the .HTML, .PDF, reStructuredText, and LaTeX formats."
