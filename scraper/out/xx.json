      "XXEncoding was originally developed as a means to transfer files as text instead of binary. In the early days of the Internet, some programs did not support binary data transfers, so converting the data to text prevented the file from being corrupted when transferred. Encoding binary files as text improved data integrity, but it also increased the file size. Additionally, the encoded files would need to be decoded before being used.",
      "XX files are similar to UUEncoded (.UU) files. Both formats are seldom used today since most programs now support binary file transfers. It is no longer necessary to encode binary files as text.",
      "NOTE: XXEncoded files may also use the .XXE file extension."
