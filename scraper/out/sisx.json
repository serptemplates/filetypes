      "A SISX file is a software installer for Symbian OS 9.1 or later. It is used to install an app on a Symbian OS device, such as cell phones that use the Nokia S60 3rd Edition platform or the UIQ 3 platform. Various Nokia and Samsung smartphones use the Nokia S60 platform. Primarily, Sony Ericsson and Motorola phones use the UIQ 3 platform."
