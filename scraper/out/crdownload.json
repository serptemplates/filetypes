      "CRDOWNLOAD files are not meant to be opened. Instead, Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, and Chromium web browsers create the files as placeholders for files while they download.",
      "However, you may be able to open an interrupted CRDOWNLOAD file, even if the web browser only downloaded a portion of the file. For example, you can still play some audio and video file types (like an .MP4 video) with a media player even though the web browser did not fully download them.",
      "To do this, delete the .crdownload extension if the browser appended it onto the file extension or change the .crdownload extension to the file's actual extension (e.g., .mp4 if you were downloading an MP4 video), then attempt to open it with the appropriate program (QuickTime Player if you are a Mac user). In the case of the MP4 video, you can play a percentage of the video similar to the web browser downloaded. For example, if the browser downloaded 30 MB of a 99 MB MP4 video, you could play roughly 11 seconds of the video's 33-second runtime.",
      "If you are unable to open the file, you can resume the download in the web browser by pasting the browser name, followed by ://downloads/ in the address bar of the web browser (e.g., chrome://downloads/), navigating to the incomplete download, and clicking Resume.",
      "Finally, if you cannot resume the download, delete the CRDOWNLOAD file and download the file again via the web browser."
