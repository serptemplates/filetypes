      "PenguinMod is a block-based development tool based on both MIT Scratch and TurboWarp (another modified version of Scratch). Using PenguinMod, developers can create animations, games, and other simple programs by dragging, dropping, and connecting code blocks.",
      "At any time, developers can save their in-process PenguinMod development project as a PMP file. PMP files are similar to Scratch 3.0's .SB3 files, except that they may contain data created and used by custom PenguinMod extensions. For this reason, it's best to open PMP files in PenguinMod, rather than Scratch or TurboWarp."
