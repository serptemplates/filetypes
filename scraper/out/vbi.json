      "Vectras VM is based on QEMU and allows users to run full operating systems, such as Linux distributions, inside a virtual environment on their phone or tablet. Advanced users or hobbyists who want to run full desktop or server environments on Android are the primary users of Vectras VM and VBI files.",
      "Users can choose VBI files to load in Vectras VM; the app then runs the prebuilt operating systems without requiring users to manually set up disk images or parameters. Vectras VM also supports a related file type, CVBI, which serves a similar purpose and can be imported the same way. Both formats help simplify the process of launching virtual machines on mobile devices."
