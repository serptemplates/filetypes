      "A NATVIS file is a debugger visualization file used by Microsoft Visual Studio, a software development tool used to create Windows programs and web applications. It contains one or more Type elements, or visualization rules, in XML format. NATVIS files are part of the Visual Studio Natvis framework that enables developers to define how native types are displayed in debugger windows, such as \"Locals\" in the Visual Studio debugger."
