      "WUX files are the compressed version of WUD files, which are typically created using Homebrew for Wii U to store game information dumped from a Wii U game. Since the game information is large in size (over 20 GB), multiple WUD files are created to store segments (around 2 GB) of the game. In order to reduce the size of a WUD file, the Wii U image compression tool can be used to compress the file and reduce it to a much smaller size, sometimes from sizes around 20 GB to 2-3 GB. The compression of the WUD file results in the WUX file."

      "A WUX file is the compressed version of a Wii U Disk Image WUD file. It is generated using the Wii U image compression tool to reduce the file size of WUD segmented files which are around 20 GB in size otherwise. This much large size game information files are reduced to around 2 GB in compressed WUX files that makes file transfer easier. WUX files can be opened and played with video game emulators such as Cemu.",
      "A WUX file is a Wii U Disk Image (.WUD file) compressed using the Wii U image compression tool. It contains all the information about a game in the WUD format but is compressed to save space. WUX files can be opened by Cemu to emulate Wii U games on a computer."
