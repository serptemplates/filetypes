      "Hasselblad introduced the 3FR format in 2006 when releasing the Hasselblad H2D camera. 3FR files created by older generations of Hasselblad cameras are compressed with lossless compression. However, Hasselblad cameras now save 3FR images with no compression.",
      "Most people who use 3FR files are professional photographers who utilize a Hasselblad digital camera that captures images as 3FR files. Camera raw files, such as 3FR files, store high-quality photographs that can be edited more accurately than compressed images (like JPEG images). However, the raw data in 3FR files lead to larger file sizes, making it difficult to store and share images.",
      "Photographers often edit 3FR images then export them in an image format that utilizes a lossy or lossless compression method. While compression reduces the image quality, it also produces more manageable file sizes for storing, sharing, and uploading images.",
      "Camera manufacturers utilize different formats to save images. Besides the 3FR format, others include:",
      "Canon - .CRW, .CR2, and .CR3 files",
      "Hasselblad - .FFF files",
      "Minolta - .MRW and .MDC files",
      "Nikon - .NEF and .NRW files",
      "Olympus - .ORF file",
      "Ricoh - .J6I file",
      "Samsung - .MRW and .MDC files",
      "Sony - .ARW, .SRF, and .SR2 files"

      "A 3FR file is a digital photograph captured by various Hasselblad digital cameras, such as X1D II 50C and 907X Special Edition. It stores image data in the Hasselblad 3F RAW (3FR) format as the camera's CCD captured it."
