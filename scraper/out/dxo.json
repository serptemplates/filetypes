      "A DXO file contains a DesignXOver (DXO) design created by Liberty Instruments XSim, a free Windows application for designing and simulating speaker crossover output. It contains a design in plain text used by XSim to simulate speaker sound pressure level responses in order to determine whether a speaker functions as intended when attached to various filter circuits.",
      "Crossover design applications allow audio engineers to test speaker sound pressure levels under a variety of filter circuit conditions. This allows engineers to fine-tune a speaker's filter circuit until the speaker functions as intended. XSim is a free crossover design application sound engineers can download and use in Windows.",
      "XSim saves engineers' crossover designs as DXO files. These files are plain text files that contain information about the power source, resistors, inductors, capacitors, and drivers included in a speaker circuit. For example, a DXO file typically begins with a line of text that specifies how many voltage sources a circuit includes. DXO files also contain the data shown in a circuit's Frequency Response and Impedance graphs."
