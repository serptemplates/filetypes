      "SUMO is an open-source traffic simulation platform used by researchers, city planners, and engineers to model traffic systems and test transportation strategies. Netedit is included with SUMO and automatically creates and updates NETECFG files.",

      "A NETECFG file is a configuration file created by Netedit, a graphical network editor included in the Simulation of Urban MObility (SUMO) software suite. It contains plain text settings in the XML standard specific to Netedit, including user interface preferences, tool options, and other environment configurations. NETECFG files help users customize how Netedit behaves and appears, improving workflow and making it easier to work on complex road networks."

    "instructions": [
      "NETECFG files are not meant to be manually opened. Instead, Netedit loads the NETECFG file automatically when it starts to set the user interface and tool configuration settings.",
      "Since NETECFG files store text in the XML standard, you can also open and edit them with an XML or plain text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit. However, the file will not appear the same in an XML or text editor as when opened with Netedit."
