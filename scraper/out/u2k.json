      "U2K ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts and renames a user's files. For example, after infection, a file named example.jpg becomes example.jpg.u2k. The ransomware then produces a ransom message named ReadMe.txt, which contains instructions users can supposedly follow to purchase a U2K decryptor using Tor Browser.",
      "Ransomware is most commonly distributed in email attachments and programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and opened an unverified attachment or program, that may be how your computer became infected by U2K ransomware.",
      "Specifically, U2K ransomware appears to be linked to the file Windows_Loader_v2.2.2.exe, a program used to illegally activate Windows. The ransomware appears to affect primarily Windows 7 users."
