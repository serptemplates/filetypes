      "A file with a .dhtml extension is a dynamic HTML file that is used to creating dynamic contents of a webpage. A web element created in DHTML is event driven and does not require to reload the page. In most of the cases, a DHTML file is used to create the dynamic contents of a webpage such as drop-down menus, floating layers, rollover buttons, and other dynamic content. You come across dynamic html elements almost daily in your life when you hover mouse on a menu item and it opens further sub-menu options. DHTML makes use of web technologies such as HTML, Javascript, HTML DOM, HTML Events and CSS to achieve the dynamic behaviour of elements.",
