      "A file with .spc extension is a digital security certificate file created in the PKCS # 7 format. Several applications, create these certificate files for secure exchange of information. Few such applications include OpenSSL and the Signcode.exe application included with Microsoft’s .NET Framework. Like other certificate files such as .cer, .p7c, and .ssp, the SPC files contain the public key information that is encrypted with a private key. This public key can be shared with users publicly while the private key is kept confidential.",
      "Audio file extracted from SNES (Super Nintendo Entertainment System) video games; contains a 16-bit, 32KHz soundtrack; often extracted from an SNES ROM using an SNES emulator."
