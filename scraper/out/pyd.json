      "Developers typically use PYD files in larger applications where Python's standard libraries may not be sufficient, or performance improvements are needed. Users can import PYD modules into their Python scripts (.PY files) to extend the range of operations Python can perform."

      "A PYD file is a Python Dynamic Module (PDM), an extension similar to a .DLL file that can be imported and used in Python programs. It contains compiled code, often written in languages like C or C++, which allows Python programs to perform tasks that require more speed or access to low-level system resources. PYD files enhance Python's capabilities by providing additional functionality, such as interacting with system hardware or optimizing performance for specific tasks."
