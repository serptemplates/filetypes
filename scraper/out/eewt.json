      "In September 2022, some PC users began reporting their computers had been infected by ransomware that encrypted their files and renamed them to use the .eewt extension. Further investigation revealed that EEWT ransomware is a variant of .STOP ransomware, one of the most commonly distributed forms of ransomware.",
      "Like other recent STOP variants (like .GERO), EEWT ransomware uses an online key to encrypt users' files. So, previous STOP decryption tools do not work on files encrypted by EEWT ransomware. At this time, there is no way to decrypt files encrypted by EEWT ransomware.",
      "EEWT ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by EEWT ransomware."

      "A file with the .eewt extension has been maliciously renamed and encrypted by EEWT ransomware. It contains a document, image, video, or other file the ransomware is holding hostage. The .eewt extension is added to the file's normal extension, producing a compound extension like .docx.eewt."
