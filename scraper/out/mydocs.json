      "The \"Send To → My Documents\" option allows users to quickly copy the selected item to their My Documents folder, a default location where many users store personal files such as documents, images, and spreadsheets. Casual or everyday users primarily use the \"Send To → My Documents\" feature when they quickly want to move or back up files to their My Documents folder without manually navigating through folders. Advanced users or system administrators might also use or modify SendTo shortcuts to streamline file organization tasks.",

      "A MYDOCS file is a file used by older versions of Microsoft Windows to enable the \"Send To → My Documents\" option that appears when you right-click a file or folder. It stores information as a Windows Shell Shortcut (also known as a .LNK file), including the target folder path (the location of the My Documents directory), along with optional settings like the working directory and icon information. MYDOCS files do not contain any user data or documents, they simply enable a specific menu action."
