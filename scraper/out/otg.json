The structure of each component of an OpenDocument format is represented by an element that has associated attributes and is common for all the document types such as text document, spreadsheet, or a drawing file. OTG, being a drawing template, extensively utilizes the Graphics Content specifications that includes:\n\nEnhanced Page Features for Graphical ApplicationsDrawing ShapesFrames3D ShapesCustom ShapePresentation ShapesPresentation AnimationsSMIL Presentation AnimationsPresentation EventsPresent Text FieldsPresentation Document Content",
      "When you save a graphic template with Draw, the application creates an OTG file to store the layout and contents. After saving the file, you can close the template, re-open it, then continue modifying it. To create an OTG file with Draw, select File → New → Drawing, modify the drawing, then select File → Save As... and choose \"ODF Drawing Template (.odg)\" from the file type dropdown menu.",

OTF files are like any other OpenDocument format based files that are based on XML format to represent the contents of the document. OTF files can be viewed by opening them in any text or standard XML editor.",
