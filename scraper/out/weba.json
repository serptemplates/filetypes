      "WebM is an open, royalty-free container format used to share videos on the web. Google developed WebM to serve as an alternative to the H.264 and H.265 video formats. Typically, WEBM files contain both video and audio data. However, some WEBM files contain only audio data. These files may be referred to as WEBA files.",
      "Often, WEBA files are created by extracting a WEBM file's audio data and saving it as a separate file. On rarer occasions, a user may create a WEBA file by saving only audio data in the WEBM format. You are most likely to encounter a WEBA file when downloading audio from the Internet, as the WebM format is used primarily to embed and share media online.",
      "You can use FFmpeg (cross-platform) to convert the audio your WEBA file contains to a variety of other audio formats. For example, you can use FFmpeg to convert your WEBA file to an .MP3 file, so you can open it in additional media players."
