      "ASW files are used to create slideshows and screensavers for Windows. You can create an ASW file using the Slideshow Wizard. To open it select Create → Slideshow File... from the application toolbar and then select the \"Create a new slideshow\" option. You will then choose if you want to create a standalone slideshow (EXE file), Windows screensaver (SCR file), or Adobe Flash Player slideshow (SWF file). The wizard walks you through the creation process as you select images, set the transitions, add text, loop audio, pick a background color, and more. All of these settings are stored in the ASW file.",
