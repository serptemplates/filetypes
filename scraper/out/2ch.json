      "Super Audio CD is a type of optical disc that Sony and Phillips developed to replace typical audio CDs. All SACDs contain audio saved in the Direct Stream Digital (DSD) audio format, which notably supports up to six audio channels. However, many SACDs also contain a \"normal CD layer,\" which includes the same audio remixed into a two-channel format.",
      "These two-channel audio files are saved as 2CH files. Each 2CH file is encoded using 16-bit pulse-code modulation and sampled at 44.1 kHz. Normal CD players can read and play a disc's 2CH files, allowing users to play their SACDs in SACD and CD players."

    "description": [
      "A 2CH file is a two-channel audio file that was likely included on a Super Audio CD (SACD). It contains a song that was ripped from a Super Audio CD or downloaded from a digital music marketplace. 2CH files are stereo versions of associated .DFF files."

      "You can open a 2CH file and play the audio it contains with VideoLAN VLC media player (multiplatform) or Foobar2000 (Windows). When using Foobar2000, you'll likely have to install a SACD plug-in, such as Super Audio CD Decoder, to play your 2CH file."
