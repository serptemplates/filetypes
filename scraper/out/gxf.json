      "The GXF format was originally developed for the interchange of camera shots over data networks and storing archives on data type. As technology has progressed, the container format has evolved to support MPEG, M-JPEG, and DV-based video compression, as well as audio, time code, and other user data. It is now a Society of motion Picture & Television Engineers (SMPTE) standard."
