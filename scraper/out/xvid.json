      "Xvid is not a video format like MP4 but rather is a video codec library following the MPEG-4 Part 2 Advanced Simple Profile (ASP) coding standard. Xvid is a competitor of the proprietary DivX codec developed by DivX Inc. In contrast to DivX, Xvid is free software distributed under the GNU General Public License. Because of this, Xvid is used on all platforms for which the source code can be compiled.\n\nThe Xvid software is used to compress and decompress video data to MPEG-4 ASP. Due to the compression supported in Xvid, a DVD movie can be sufficiently compressed to fit onto a CD while still retaining the DVD quality. The compressed video is stored with the .xvid extension. Xvid can be considered as ZIP for video files. Xvid compresses video at a 200:1 or more ratio. This allows for more efficient disk storage and faster transmission over networks.",
      "Video clip or movie encoded using Xvid, an open-source video codec published under the GNU GPL license; compresses video data using MPEG-4 technology; allows for faster data transmission and more efficient storage of video files."
