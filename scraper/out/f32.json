      "The F32 format represents each audio sample using 32-bit floating point values, supporting a wide dynamic range that captures quiet and loud sounds with greater accuracy (e.g., no distortion or clipping). Since it's uncompressed and high precision, F32 files are typically very large in size, making them less suitable for casual listening or distribution but ideal for mastering, editing, and detailed sound design work where preserving the audio's full quality is essential. Users typically convert or export F32 files into more common formats like WAV or FLAC once they finish editing them."

    "description": [
      "An F32 file is an audio file that stores raw sound data in a 32-bit floating point format, which is uncompressed sound information represented as numerical values that describe the sound waves. Unlike common audio formats, such as .MP3 and .WAV, an F32 file does not include headers or metadata, only the raw audio data. F32 files are typically used in professional audio editing and processing, where high-quality, uncompressed sound is needed."
