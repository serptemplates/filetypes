      "BVS Solitaire Collection is a cross-platform application that allows solitaire enthusiasts to play not only classic solitaire, but Tri-Peaks, FreeCell, Spider Solitaire, and many additional variations. Players can even use the program's Modify Rules feature to create their own, custom versions of solitaire. They can also use BVS Solitaire Collection's statistics- and score-tracking features to see whether their play is improving and how they stack up against other players from around the world.",
      "When a player saves a game in BVS Solitaire Collection, the program creates a BVS file that stores the game's current state. The player can use this file to resume playing their in-progress game at a later time, return to an earlier juncture within their current game, or share their game with another BVS Solitaire Collection player.",
      "NOTE: Players must save BVS files with the default filename assigned by BVS Solitaire Collection. Attempting to change a BVS file's default name may cause BVS Solitaire Collection to freeze."
