      "Model data file used by Point Oven, a commercial suite of plugins used for transferring vertex and fcurve data between modeling programs; saves \"baked\" vertex data for every animation frame of a specified mesh; allows actual vertex mesh positions, or deformations, to be exchanged between other programs that have Point Oven MDD support."
