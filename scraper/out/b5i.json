      "B5I files are often accompanied by a .B5T file, which contains track and session information for the disc. While the B5I file contains the actual data copied from the CD or DVD, such as music, software, or other content, the B5T file helps software interpret how that data is organized. Together, these files allow users to make accurate copies of their original discs."

It contains a complete copy of the data from an optical disc in binary format, including the file structure and content, that BlindWrite 5 can recreate as a physical or virtual disc."
