      "A PLUGIN file is a plugin used by Photoshop, an image-editing application. It stores content that extends the functionality of the default Photoshop application and is often used for adding image effects and filters, or support for a new raster image format. PLUGIN files may be created and sold by third-party developers. Several preinstalled PLUGIN files are stored in Photoshop installations within the Plug-ins directory."
