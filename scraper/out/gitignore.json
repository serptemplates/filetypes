      "GITIGNORE files are standard for all projects tracked with Git, and they use the name .gitignore with no filename prefix. Most often, developers include a single .gitignore file in the project's root directory which specifies all exclusions for the project. However, additional .gitignore files may be placed in subdirectories to apply directory-specific exclusions as well.",
      "Many GITIGNORE templates exist on the web and with developer IDEs, which help bootstrap Git projects for different programming languages and technology stacks. For example, GitHub provides several templates on the gitignore project page."

      "A GITIGNORE file is a settings file used by Git, a version control system that allows developers to track source code changes. It contains a list of files that should not be included in the source code repository. GITIGNORE files help developers exclude unwanted items such as hidden operating system files (e.g., .DS_Store and Thumbs.db), temporary files, and project outputs."
