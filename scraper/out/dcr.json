      "DCR files are similar to Flash (.SWF) files, but created with Adobe Director rather than Adobe Flash. Adobe Shockwaver Player can also open the file but runs as a web browser plug-in.",
      "NOTE: Director was originally developed by Macromedia, which was acquired by Adobe at the end of 2005."

      "A file with dcr extension contains the content of a digital photograph saved in the Kodak Digital Camera RAW (DCR) format. The DCR is short for Digital Camera Raw; contains the uncompressed and lossless version of the images data captured by a Kodak digital camera. The professional photographers like to use these files, because they store images at a higher quality than low quality compressed image formats.",
      "A DCR file is an interactive media file saved in the Shockwave format for distribution on the web. It is often used for creating web games and other highly interactive content."
