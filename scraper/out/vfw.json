      "The VFW format was introduced in the 1990s when Microsoft released the Video for Windows software suite in 1992. The format peaked in usage in the mid-1990s when Video for Windows was bundled with several Windows operating systems. However, the format became less common in the late-1990s as Video for Windows was dropped from Windows operating systems.",
      "While VFW files are no longer common, they are still supported by several video programs. Some applications that can play VFW files include Microsoft Windows Media Player, Apple QuickTime Player, and MPlayerX."
