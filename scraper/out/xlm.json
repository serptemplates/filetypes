      "Microsoft introduced XLM files in 1992 with the release of Excel 4.0. The files were commonly used by Excel users until the late-2000s, when Microsoft released Excel 2007. Excel 2007 enabled users to save macros with spreadsheets and save those spreadsheets as .XLSM or .XLTM files.",
      "While XLM files are not as common as they once were, you may still encounter an XLM file that was packaged with an older version of Excel or created by a user. To create an XLM file in Excel 4.0 to 2003, select Tools → Macro → Record New Macro.... When creating the macro, you can assign a keyboard shortcut to run the macro.",
