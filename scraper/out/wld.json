      "In Terraria, players explore a 2D open world. Players can create new or load existing worlds on Terraria's Select World screen. When a player creates a new world, they specify the world's name, seed, size, and game type. Terraria then saves the player's world in a WLD file.",
      "The PC versions of Terraria store WLD files in the following directories:",
      "Windows: ~/​Users/​YourUserName/​Documents/​My Games/​Terraria/​Worlds",
      "Mac: ~/​Users/​YourUserName/​Library/​Application Support/​Terraria/​Worlds",
      "Players can load WLD files when playing Terraria in single-player or multiplayer mode. For example, when a player hosts a multiplayer game, they can host that game using one of their existing WLD files (by selecting it from the Select World screen during the setup process).",
      "NOTE: Terraria also saves backups of players' WLD files. These .BAK files use the .wld.bak extension and are saved in the same directory as WLD files."

      "A WLD file is a game world created by Re-Logic Terraria, a 2D action-adventure and sandbox construction game. It contains a record of the world's terrain, water, monsters, items, and other world objects. Players create and load WLD files from Terraria's Select World screen."

      "You can also open WLD files with various third-party Terraria map editors and viewers. For example, TEdit (Windows) allows players to edit the world a WLD file contains. TerraMap (Windows, Web) allows players to view a map of the world a WLD file contains."
