      "The descript.ion file (which reads \"description\" but with \"ion\" as the three-letter extension) has been used in various contexts, including with older bulletin board systems (BBSs), 4DOS (an alternative MS-DOS command-line interpreter), and with extensions to Drupal CMS software, such as Filebrowser and File Tree. XnView also supports ION files to export and import metadata in the program.",
