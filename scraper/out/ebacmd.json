To use an EBACMD file as an EBA Command Center command, you must install and set up the program, and then enter the command's name in EBA Command Center's text box. If you want to open and examine an EBACMD file before using it with EBA Command Center (for example, to verify what type of command it contains), you can do so using any text editor."
