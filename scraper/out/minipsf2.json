      "File created to play audio, similar to a .PSF2 file; contains imported sequence data for songs from .PSFLIB2 files located in the same directory; in order to work properly, MINIPSF2 files must be able to access driver code and sound banks from PSFLIB2 files; can be zlib compressed to save space and increase efficiency; commonly used by Sony PlayStation 2, a video game console; newer version of the .MINIPSF file."
