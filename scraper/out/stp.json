      "The STEP file format is a standardized 3D model format that engineers can use to save and transfer 3D models between different computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) programs. Before the STEP format's existence, users of one program often could not open models created in another program, making it difficult to share 3D models among users.",
      "Most STEP files are saved with the .stp file extension. However, you may also encounter STEP models saved with the .step extension (.STEP files). The files contain plain text data that a CAD or CAM program references to load a 3D model. For example, many STP files contain data used to show a model of a manufactured mold or part."

      "An STP file is a 3D CAD file used for exchange of product data between CAD and CAM applications. It contains information about 3D objects and is saved similar to the STEP file format. STP files facilitate the exchange of data between applications as per the STEP Application Protocols ISO 10303-2xx. This ISO defines the encoding mechanism for data representation in EXPRESS data modeling language. STP files can be opened in applications such as such as Autodesk Fusion 360.",
      "An STP file is a 3D assembly file supported by various mechanical design programs, such as IMSI TurboCAD and Autodesk Fusion 360. It contains three-dimensional object data saved in the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP) format. STP files are saved in a text-based ASCII format that conforms to the STEP Application Protocols ISO 10303-2xx."
