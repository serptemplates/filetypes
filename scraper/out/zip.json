      "ZIP files have capability to store multiple files using different compression techniques while at the same time supports storing a file without any compression. Each file is stored/compressed individually which helps to extract them, or add new ones, without applying compression or decompression to the entire archive.",
      "The Zip format was created in 1989 by Phil Katz and was used in the PKZIP utility developed by PKWARE, Inc. The format grew in popularity and is now supported by most file compression/decompression programs.",
      "You may encounter ZIP files in various ways, such as receiving compressed files via email from a friend or co-worker, downloading files online, or exploring backup files that have been compressed with Zip compression. Both Windows and macOS come with programs that can compress and decompress ZIP files.",
      "Windows users can create ZIP archives by right-clicking a file and selecting Send to → Compressed (zipped) folder. macOS users can create ZIP archives by right-clicking a file and selecting Compress \"[filename]\"."

    "description": [
      "A file with .zip extension is an archive that can hold one or more files or directories. The archive can have compression applied to the included files in order to reduce the ZIP file size. ZIP file format was made public back in February 1989 by Phil Katz for achieving archiving of files and folders. The format was made part of PKZIP utility, created by PKWARE, Inc. Right after the availability of available specifications, many companies made ZIP file format part of their software utilities including Microsoft (since Windows 7), Apple (Mac OS X ) and many others.",
      "A ZIP file is an archive that contains one or more files compressed or \"zipped\" with Zip compression. It stores files separately from each other, allowing the files to be compressed using different methods and extracted without compressing or decompressing the entire archive."
