      "ESRI file Geodatabase (FileGDB) is a collection of files in a folder on disc that hold related geospatial data such as feature datasets, feature classes and associated tables. It requires certain other files to be kept alongside the .gdb file in the same directory for it to work. Queries can be executed on the .gdb file to manage spatial as well as non-spatial data.",
      "A GDB file is a database file created by MapSource, a GPS route editing and trip-planning application. It contains waypoints, routes, and tracks that can be transferred to a Garmin navigation device. GDB files are similar to the universally transferrable .GPX files."
