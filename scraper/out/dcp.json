      "A DCP file is a digital negative (DNG) camera profile used by Adobe image-editing products, such as Adobe Photoshop and Lightroom. It contains the initial color rendering settings when importing a RAW digital photo. DCP files describe the interpretation of color information for digital raw image data. They are typically stored in the Adobe Standard directory."
