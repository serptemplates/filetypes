      "The Gizmondo is a handheld gaming console that was available in 2005 and 2006, before being discontinued. Colors is a Gizmondo game that was never officially released, as it was not completed before Gizmondo production ceased. However, unofficial, not-quite-complete versions of Colors are available online.",
      "In Colors, players engage in single-player or multiplayer third-person shooter gameplay. Notably, in the game's multiplayer mode, game levels are generated based on a player's real-life GPS coordinates. The game stores its audio files in a set of ISA archives, which group related audio together."
