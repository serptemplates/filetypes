      "An “FPT” file is a file extension associated with the FoxPro database management system. In FoxPro, the FPT file contains memo fields associated with a table. Memo fields are used to store large amounts of text or binary data, such as lengthy descriptions, documents, or images, which may not fit in a regular database field.\n\nHere is how the FoxPro file structure works:\n\nDBF (Database File): This is the main file that contains the structured data in tabular format, including regular fields. Each record corresponds to a row in the table, and each field within a record corresponds to a column.FPT (Memo File): The FPT file is used to store memo fields associated with the records in the DBF file. Each memo field corresponds to a record in the DBF file, and the FPT file stores the actual memo content.CDX (Index File): These files store indexes that improve the performance of searching and sorting data in the DBF file.\n\nIf you have a FoxPro database with memo fields, you should have corresponding DBF, FPT, and possibly CDX files for each table. The FPT file contains binary data and is not meant to be opened directly with a text editor. Instead, it’s accessed and managed through the FoxPro application or other compatible database tools."
