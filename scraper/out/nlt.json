      "As part of its Globalization Services, Windows includes Extended Linguistic Services (ELS) that are implemented as a dynamic link library (DLL). When developers create internationalized Windows apps, they can reference Windows' ELS to perform certain functions, including automatically mapping UTF-16 characters used in one language to characters used in another language.",
