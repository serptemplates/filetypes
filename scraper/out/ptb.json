      "Power Tab Editor allows musicians to write and share tablature in an accessible format. The format is widely shared in the music community since it is helpful for beginners and experienced players who want a more straightforward way to learn music without reading traditional sheet music.",
      "Brad Larsen initially developed and released Power Tab Editor in the late 1990s. Although the program became popular among guitarists and bassists, development eventually ceased in the early 2000s. However, fans of the software continued developing it after acquiring its source code and released a second open-source version, which saves tablature as .PT2 files instead of PTB files."
