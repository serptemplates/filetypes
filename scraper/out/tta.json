      "The True Audio codec is an open-source codec that allows users to compress audio files without losing any data. This allows users to store several smaller audio files in the same amount of disk space that one larger file would take up. TTA files can contain compressed multichannel 8, 16, and 24-bit .WAV data.",
      "Because TTA files are uncommon, your operating system's default media player may not be able to play them. However, you can open TTA files using the media players listed below."

      "A TTA file is an audio file that has been compressed using the True Audio (TTA) codec. It contains audio that has been losslessly compressed to between 30 to 70 percent of its original file size. Many media players require the installation of a plug-in or codec pack to play TTA files."

      "Several popular media players allow users to open and play TTA files. VideoLAN VLC Media player (cross-platform) and KMPlayer (Windows) natively support the TTA audio format, while Windows Media Player (Windows) and Nullsoft Winamp (Windows) require users to install a codec pack or plug-in to play TTA files. For example, you can install the K-Lite Codec Pack to play TTA files in Windows Media Player."
