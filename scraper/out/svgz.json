      "A file with .svgz extension is a compressed version of Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG) file. It is compressed with gzip compression and contains data in XML format. SVGZ files support transparency, gradients, animations, and filters. SVGZ files are smaller in size as compared to the default SVG files and this reduced file size helps transfer the graphics files online. Graphics designer create SVGZ files using tools like Adobe Illustrator, Corel PaintShop Pro, and others. However, SVGZ files can be generated by enabling GZip compression in the Apache Server while sending out the image data.",
      "An SVGZ file is a Scalable Vector Graphics (.SVG) file compressed with gzip compression. It contains graphics data in XML, which includes the positioning of lines, text, curves, colors, and shapes that make up a two-dimensional graphic. SVGZ files also support layers, transparency, gradients, animations, and filters."
