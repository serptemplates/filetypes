      "TeamViewer is a program used to remotely control devices in order to provide technical support. And TeamViewer Pilot is a remote assistance tool provided through the TeamViewer desktop application that features augmented reality to provide support remotely between experts and users that need assistance.",
      "The purpose of the TPSR file is to store a protocol of a TeamViewer Pilot connection between an \"expert\" and an end-user for reviewal purposes. The file is automatically generated by TeamViewer at the end of a TeamViewer Pilot connection if the \"Connection reporting\" setting is enabled. Some examples of data stored in the JSON file include the device type and name, Pilot ID, Expert ID, and the date, time, and duration of the connection."

    "description": [
      "A TPSR is a connection protocol file used by the TeamViewer Assist AR (previously known as TeamViewer Pilot). Information stored in a TPSR file is stored in compressed ZIP file format. TPSR contains detailed history of TeamViewer connection between an expert and a technician for resolving issue and reviewal purpose. Information contained inside a TPSR file includes device type, name, Assist AR ID, Expert ID, date and time, and duration of the connection. This data is stored in a JSON file inside the compressed TPSR archive.",
      "A TPSR file stores a connection protocol created after a TeamViewer Pilot connection conducted through the desktop version of TeamViewer. It is a Zip-compressed archive that contains a .JSON data file and one or more .PNG screenshots of the connection when annotations are added."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open TPSR files using the desktop version of TeamViewer software. If installed on your compture, double-clciking the TPSR file will open it in TeamViewer software. TPSR files can be exported to PDF files as well or can be printed to have a printed copy of the protocol file.",
      "You can open TPSR files with the desktop version of TeamViewer (version 15.11 and later) installed on your computer. Simply double-click the TPSR file, then TeamViewer prompts your default web browser to display the contents of the file. You can then save the protocol as a .PDF file or print it.",
      "Since TPSR files are Zip-compressed, you can also manually decompress the files with a Zip compression utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer, Apple Archive Utility, or Corel WinZip. You may need to rename the .tpsr file extension to .zip in order to extract the JSON and PNG files in the archive. Keep in mind that the information will not appear the same as if you opened it with TeamViewer."
