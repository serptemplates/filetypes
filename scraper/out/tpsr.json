      "You can open TPSR files with the desktop version of TeamViewer (version 15.11 and later) installed on your computer. Simply double-click the TPSR file, then TeamViewer prompts your default web browser to display the contents of the file. You can then save the protocol as a .PDF file or print it.",
      "Since TPSR files are Zip-compressed, you can also manually decompress the files with a Zip compression utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer, Apple Archive Utility, or Corel WinZip. You may need to rename the .tpsr file extension to .zip in order to extract the JSON and PNG files in the archive. Keep in mind that the information will not appear the same as if you opened it with TeamViewer."
