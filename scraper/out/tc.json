      "An anonymous group of developers named TrueCrypt Foundation developed TrueCrypt as a tool for securing sensitive data. The foundation released it in February 2004 but ended its development in 2014. VeraCrypt, a fork of TrueCrypt, replaced the tool and still supports the TC format. However, users often convert old TrueCrypt volumes to more actively maintained encryption formats for better security."

      "A TC file is an encrypted volume created by TrueCrypt, a now-discontinued open-source disk encryption program. TC files function as virtual disks, securely storing files with real-time encryption (inaccessible without the correct password or key) and allowing users to access their contents when they mount them in TrueCrypt."
