      "A WFP file was a patch file used by the Turtle Beach WaveFront synthesizer cards. It is no more used as Turtle Beach has stopped producing sound cards and synthesizers. The WFP file contains a single program or patch that can be applied to the synthesizer. WFP files can also be converted to MP4 file format.",
