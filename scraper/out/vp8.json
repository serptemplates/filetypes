      "VP8 is announced by Google as one of the best video formats having the best picture quality data rate and encoding speed. The best advantage of VP8 is that its a royalty-free substitute of H.264. It is a specific format for encoding and decoding high-quality video as a file or a bitstream. It’s free because Google has released all the VP8 patents under a royalty-free public license. Almost 90% or more of all WebRTC video sessions use VP8."
