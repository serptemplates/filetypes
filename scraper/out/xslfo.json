      "XSL-FO (XSL Formatting Objects) is a powerful stylesheet language for formatting XML documents. The semantics of the bounded form of paper and print is expressed by XSL-FO when the dimensions are fixed. In contrast to HTML, which represents the semantics of the unbounded form of a browser window with variable dimensions. The XML documents formatted by XSL-FO are mostly used to generate PDF files. XSL (Extensible Stylesheet Language) is a set of feature-complete W3C technologies intended to design for formatting and exchanging XML documents and XSL-FO part of this language. XSLT and XPath are also other parts of XSL.\n\nIt is proposed that XML documents should be transformed first into XSL-FO, PDF is an example of this criteria. In PDF, results are rendered using XSLTfirst, and then XSL-FO formatter. In this fashion, XML documents can be formatted randomly. Though XSL-FO takes the advantage of using Cascading Style Sheet (CSS) properties and extending them where ever necessary for the real format, it houses the provision of page templates called page masters in the terminology of XSL-FO. XSL-FO also provides formatting for fairly sophisticated documents and supports index generation."
