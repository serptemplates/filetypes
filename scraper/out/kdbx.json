      "KeePass is a password management application that allows users to catalog all their logins and passwords in a single database. That way, users can refer to the database whenever they need to remember any of their login information.",
      "Version 2 of KeePass stores users' login credentials in a KDBX database file. The KDBX format replaced KeePass 1's .KDB format. However, KeePass 2 can still import KDB databases and export databases as KDB files.",

      "A KDBX file is a password database created by KeePass Password Safe, a free password manager for Windows. It stores an encrypted database of passwords that can be viewed only using a master password set by the user. KDBX files are used to securely store personal login credentials for Windows, email accounts, FTP sites, e-commerce sites, and other purposes."

      "You can open a KDBX file with the Windows version of KeePass Password Safe. To do so, select File → Open → Open File... from the program's menu bar. Then, navigate to and open your KDBX file. KeePass will then ask you to enter the password needed to open your KDBX file.",
      "You can also import a KDBX file into Keeper Desktop, a paid, multiplatform password management app, to view the login information the file contains. KeePassXC is an open-source, cross-platform option that supports KDBX files, too."
