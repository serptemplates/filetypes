      "A DWL file is a lock file created by TurboCAD, a program used to draft 2D and 3D designs. It stores lock information when a drawing (.TCW file) is currently opened in the program. DWL files are used for preventing simultaneous access to a drawing, which may cause the file to become corrupted."
