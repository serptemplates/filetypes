If you still want to attempt to view the files' contents, you can open them in a universal file viewer, or you can change the files' extension to .txt and open them in a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows), Apple TextEdit (Mac), or GitHub Atom (cross-platform). However, keep in mind that your PDU file's contents will likely not be useful."
