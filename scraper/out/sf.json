      "An SF file stores a digital signature used by Minecraft to verify the integrity and authenticity of the game's core files. It is named CODESIGN.SF and is located in the META-INF directory inside the Minecraft.jar file. Since Minecraft is written in Java, this type of signature file is part of Java's standard way of signing .JAR (Java Archive) files to prevent tampering."
