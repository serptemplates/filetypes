      "CNC Mastercam is a widely-used CAD/CAM package that engineers and machinists use to design and produce mechanical components. CNC Software developed the Learning Edition of Mastercam for students, teachers, and professionals to be able to try the software before purchasing it.",
      "Since the Learning Edition of Mastercam does not allow you to save models in the default Mastercam format, CNC Software developed the EMCAM format. You can create an EMCAM file with Mastercam Learning Edition by selecting File → Save or Save As. After saving the model, you can close the file, then re-open it to continue modifying it."

      "An EMCAM file is a 3D model created by CNC Software Mastercam Learning Edition, the free trial of Mastercam computer-aided design (CAD) software. It contains one or more objects with their 3D coordinates, levels, planes, and other information. Machinists often create and edit mechanical parts with Mastercam Learning Edition to produce physical copies of the part."
