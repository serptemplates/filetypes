      "Game developers, hobbyists, and designers use Crocotile 3D to build 3D worlds with a simple, grid-based approach. They typically encounter CROCOTILE files when creating new levels or scenes within Crocotile 3D.",
      "They save their work, share scenes with collaborators, or archive projects as CROCOTILE files for later use. Crocotile 3D also allows users to export a CROCOTILE scene for use in games or other projects."

      "A CROCOTILE file is a scene created by Crocotile 3D, an application for creating and editing 3D environments using a tile-based system. It stores the layout of tiles, objects, textures, and camera settings that comprise a 3D scene in the JSON standard. CROCOTILE files may also include lighting information, object properties, and layer organization for the scene."
