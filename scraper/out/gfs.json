      "A GFS file contains a split file created by Glary Utilities, a Windows utility that enables you to clean and organize your computer. It stores a file that has been split up in order to create smaller files for transfer purposes. Each GFS file is a smaller part of a whole and can only be opened by joining it together with its other parts through the Glary Utilities program."
