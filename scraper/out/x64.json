      "The X64 format supports disk images dumped from various types of Commodore disks, including 1541, 1571, and 1581. Teemu Rantanen initially developed it for the Unix-based X64 emulator, which the VICE emulator eventually superseded.",
      "You will likely only encounter an X64 file if you are a computing enthusiast attempting to emulate a game or program from the discontinued Commodore 64 computer. Some computing enthusiasts dump disk image data from an actual floppy disk or cartridge and save it in the X64 format to run in an emulator on their computer. However, most enthusiasts download X64 files from websites.",
      "NOTE: The X64 format is one of several formats utilized to store Commodore 64 disk images. Some others include .G41 and .D64."
