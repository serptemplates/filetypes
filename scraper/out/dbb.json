      "Niklas Zennström, Janus Friis, Priit Kasesalu, Toivo Annus, Ahti Heinla, and Jaan Tallinn initially developed and released Skype in 2003. Several companies have acquired and sold the technology through the years, with Microsoft currently maintaining the telecommunications software (and introducing the DB format to replace DBB files).",
