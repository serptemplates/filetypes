      "MPG files typically incorporate MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 audio and video compression. MPEG-1 is one of the most widely used lossy video/audio formats in the world since it is supported by a large number of video and audio applications. MPEG-2 was developed to improve on the shortcomings of MPEG-1, which includes only a two-channel audio compression system and insufficient support for the demands of higher resolution video.",
      "MPG files are saved in a program stream container format known as PS or MPEG-PS. The format stores audio, video, and metadata that has been interleaved together in one stream for efficient deliverability."

    "description": [
      "The file with a .mpg extension belongs to the group of file extensions for MPEG-1 or MPEG-2 audio and video compression. MPEG-1 Part 2 video is not easily available, and this extension (MPG file format) typically points to a MPEG program stream which is defined in MPEG-1 and MPEG-2, or an MPEG transport stream which is defined in MPEG-2. Other extensions such as .m2ts also exist specifying the accurate container, in this case, MPEG-2 TS, but this has little pertinence to MPEG-1 media. The .mp3 is the most common extension for files containing MP3 audio. An MP3 file is a typical stream of raw audio; the traditional way to tag MP3 files is by writing stream data to “garbage” segments of each frame, which save the media information but are discarded by the mpg file player. This is a similar technique used to tag the AAC files, but less supported nowadays.",
      "An MPG file is a common video file that uses a digital video format standardized by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG). It stores video, audio, and metadata interleaved together. MPG files are often used for creating movies that are distributed on the Internet."
