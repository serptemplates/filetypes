      "X_T files are used by the standard, Translators, and Bodyshop editions of Parasolid, and are used in place of older version XMT_TXT and XMP_TXT files. The X_T files are saved in text format and can be exported and imported using a variety of other CAD programs. X_T files may also be saved in binary format in .X_B files, which are less common than X_T files."
