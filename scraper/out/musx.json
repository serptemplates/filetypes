      "Composers use MakeMusic Finale to create, edit, and listen to musical scores. For example, a composer might use Finale to compose a new version of \"Auld Lang Syne,\" add lyrics to the score, and play the score back via their computer's speakers to check for errors.",
      "Finale 2014 and later versions save the scores that composers create as MUSX files. In addition to the score a composer has created, each MUSX file contains MIDI data that Finale uses when playing back the score.",

      "The ‘.musx’ file is the proprietary project format for MakeMusic Finale, the industry-standard music notation software. Functioning as a comprehensive digital score, a MUSX file encapsulates the complete blueprint of a musical piece—including every note, rhythmic value, dynamic marking, and articulation symbol. Beyond the raw musical data, this versatile format also stores essential metadata such as the work’s title, the composer’s name, and copyright details, making it a self-contained repository for both the artistic and administrative aspects of a composition.\n\nPeople who compose music use MakeMusic Finale to make, edit, and listen to their musical creations. For example, someone might use Finale to write new version of song, add lyrics to it and then play it on their computer to make sure everything sounds right.\n\nWhen composers save their work in Finale, it is saved as MUSX file. Inside this file, there is not only musical notes but also data that helps Finale play back music when you want to listen to it.",
      "A MUSX file is a musical score created by MakeMusic Finale, a popular scorewriting program. It contains musical notation, including measures, notes, time signatures, tempos, and clefs. It likely also includes a title, composer information, and copyright information."
