      "Vivo Software developed the VIVO format to deliver compressed video over slow Internet connections. The technology enabled streaming content on dial-up networks, a common issue in the 1990s.",
      "In 1997, RealNetworks acquired Vivo Software, and integrated some of its streaming technologies into RealPlayer. After the acquisition, RealNetworks discontinued the VIVO format, and newer streaming formats like RealVideo and other modern codecs replaced it."
