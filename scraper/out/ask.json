      "A file with .ask extension is a database file created by askSam Systems, a personal information manager (PIM) application. These type of files are stored in dynamic folders and contain user data such as email messages, documents, text files, spreadsheets, addresses, and web pages. This allows askSam software to search them easily and retrieve the data for research purpose. The askSam software, though a simple Form based desktop application storing data in database, was popular for organizing and retrieving such data.
