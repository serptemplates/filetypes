    "description": [
      "A POV file is a plain text file that contains instructions for the POV-Ray ray tracing software. These instructions are written in a special scripting language that is specific to POV-Ray. It specifies the scene to be rendered, including the 3D objects, materials, lighting, and other properties that define the appearance of the scene. POV files use a special scripting language that is specific to POV-Ray and can be used to create complex and detailed 3D scenes. The file extension for a POV file is typically “.pov” or “.povray.” When you open a POV file in POV-Ray, the software reads the instructions in the file and uses them to generate a rendered image of the scene.\n\nThe .pov files are often used by artists and designers to create 3D graphics and animations for a variety of applications, including film, television, video games, and marketing materials.",
      "Three-dimensional graphic that uses the Persistence of Vision Raytracer (POV-Ray) format; supports shapes, colors, textures, rotations, light, atmospheric effects, viewing perspectives, and other 3D image properties; stored in an ASCII text format."
