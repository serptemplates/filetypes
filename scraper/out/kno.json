      "A KNO file is a data file created by DigIN, a program used for information management and knowledge discovery. It contains a \"break model,\" which classifies the information from a set of digital resources (documents, webpages, etc.) into a structure that allows patterns, relationships, and origins of data to be discovered. KNO files organize data by content, context, and structure, using a figure referred to as a Borromean ring."
