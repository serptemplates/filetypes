      "Macromedia developed the DEWF format and SoundEdit in the late 1980s and 1990s for basic audio recording and editing. SoundEdit allowed users to cut, paste, and manipulate sound clips. Sound Cap was a simpler utility for Macintosh that captured audio from input devices like microphones, which users could then save and edit in programs like SoundEdit. Both programs supported Apple’s proprietary audio formats, including DEWF.",
      "As digital audio technology advanced, more flexible and standardized file types replaced DEWF and similar legacy formats. Modern audio formats include .WAV, .AIFF, and .MP3, which offer better compression, compatibility, and metadata support.",
      "NOTE: While DEWF files were common in the 1990s on classic Mac OS systems, they are now obsolete."

      "A DEWF file is an audio file saved in the Digitized Enhanced Waveform Format (DEWF) used by older Macintosh applications like Macromedia SoundEdit and MacNifty Sound Cap. It stores a sample, which is a short audio recording, assigned to specific instruments for playback. DEWF files allowed users to simulate real instrument sounds using recorded audio clips instead of synthesized tones."
