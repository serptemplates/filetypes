      "To host secure websites, web server administrators typically apply for digital certificates from third-party Certificate Authorities, such as GoDaddy, Verisign, or Thawte. These certificates are saved in various formats, including the CRT format.",
      "After receiving a certificate, administrators must place it on their web server, within the website they want to secure. When a user accesses the site, the web server passes the certificate to the user's web browser, to verify the site's identity. (If a browser cannot verify a certificate, it may instead show a page that says \"This website's certificate is expired.\")",

      "A file with .crt extension is a security certificate file that is used by secure websites for establishing secure connections from web server to a browser. Secure websites make it possible to secure data transfers, logins, payment card transactions, and provide protected browsing to the site. If you open a secure website, you see a “lock” icon in the address bar. If you click on it, you can view the details of the installed certificate. International companies such as Verisign and Thawte distribute these SSL certificates.",
      "A CRT file is an encoded digital certificate used by a secure website. It identifies the website and verifies its authenticity. CRT files may be saved in a variety of certificate formats, including the Distinguished Encoding Rules (.DER) and Privacy Enhanced Mail (.PEM) formats."
