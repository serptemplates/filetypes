      "Retrospect Backup is a program that Windows and Mac users can use to periodically back up files stored on their PC and external hard drives. In the past, Retrospect Backup allowed users to install add-on features using RXT files. However, RXT files and Retrospect Backup extensions are not mentioned in Retrospect Backup 18's documentation. Therefore, current versions of Retrospect Backup likely do not allow users to install additional features using RXT files."
