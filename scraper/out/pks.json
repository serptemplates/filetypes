      "Developers and database administrators use PKS files when building and maintaining Oracle database applications. The files allow developers to separate an application's interface from its implementation.",
      "This means a developer can change the logic in the PKB file without affecting programs that rely on the public definitions in the PKS file, as long as the interface remains the same. This separation improves code maintainability and helps with version control and security."

      "A PKS file is a package specification file used by Oracle PL/SQL, Oracle's procedural extension to the SQL programming language. It defines the public interface of an Oracle package, including the procedures, functions, constants, variables, and other elements that other programs or users can access. PKS files do not include the actual code logic, which is stored in a separate .PKB file (the package body)."
