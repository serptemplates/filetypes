      "You will most likely never see a TAX16 file since TurboTax saves tax returns as TAX2016 files by default. However, if you do come across the TAX16 file you can open it with the 2016 desktop version of TurboTax, which is available for both Windows and Mac. You can then save the tax return as a TAX2016 file.",
      "TAX16 files can be electronically submitted to the IRS and state tax authorities when completed. The \"e-file\" process is free for federal returns, but usually requires a fee to file state returns electronically. TAX16 files can also be printed and mailed."
