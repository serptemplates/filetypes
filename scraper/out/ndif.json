      "An NDIF file is a disk image saved in Apple's New Disk Image Format (NDIF), which was introduced with Disk Copy 6.0, an older Mac Classic application. It compresses data in a dual-fork format, which is comprised of metadata in the resource fork and data in the data fork. NDIF files were used as an older format for mounting file systems on Mac computers."
