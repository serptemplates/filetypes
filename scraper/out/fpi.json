      "Game designers and hobbyists who build FPS games with FPS Creator are the primary users of FPI files. The program reads FPI files to determine the logic that drives non-playable characters (NPCs) and other interactive objects within a game. This allows creators to design varied gameplay experiences by assigning different scripts to various characters or objects."

      "An FPI file is a script created by FPS Creator, a game development tool for creating 3D first-person shooter (FPS) games. It defines how in-game characters behave by controlling their artificial intelligence (AI). Developers use FPI files to specify actions such as how enemies move, attack, or react to the player."
