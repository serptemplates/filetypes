      "A file with .mdf extension is a Master Database File used by Microsoft SQL Server to store user data. It is of prime importance as all the data is stored in this file. The MDF file stores users data in relational databases in the form columns, rows, fields, indexes, views, and tables. SQL Server allows to set autogrow and autoshrink settings to have a positive impact on the performance of the database. MDF files can be loaded and attached to a database using Microsoft SQL Server. MDF files have Application/octet-stream mime type.",
      "An MDF file is a disc image saved by a disc authoring program such as Alcohol 120%. It stores the actual CD or DVD disc data, while the header and track information is stored in a corresponding .MDS file. MDF files are similar to .ISO files, but are saved in a different format."
