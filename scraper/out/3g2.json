      "The 3G2 format is based on the ISO base media file format defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 – MPEG-4 Part 12. 3G2 file format was developed for mobile phones to reduce storage, bandwidth, and data usage. 3G2 file format supports the following codecs:\n\nVideoMPEG-4 Part 2H.263MPEG-4 Part 10 (AVC/H.264)AudioAMR-WBAMR-NBAAC-LCHE-AAC v1EVRCEVRC-BEVRC-WB13K (QCELP)SMVVMR-WB\n\nFor the storage of MPEG-4 content, 3G2 refers to the MP4 and AVC specifications, and for the storage of H.263 and AMR content, it refers to the 3GP specifications.",
      "The 3G2 format is an updated version of the .3GP format developed by the 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP). These two formats are similar as they are based on the ISO base media file format, which was designed to be extensible and flexible for interchanging and presenting media. As a result, 3G2 supports many of the same video and audio streams supported by the 3GP format along with additional audio streams, such as SMV, EVRC, EVRC-B, EVRC-WB, and QCELP.",
      "Also, the 3GP format was designed for GSM-based (Global System for Mobile Communications), whereas the 3G2 format was designed for CDMA-based (Code Division Multiple Access) phones. Overall, 3G2 requires less storage, bandwidth, and data usage."
