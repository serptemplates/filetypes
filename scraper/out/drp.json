      "DaVinci Resolve is a popular free video editing program. It allows users to combine, layer, trim, and add effects to video, audio, and image files, before combining the files into a final, rendered video.",
      "By default, DaVinci Resolve does not save users' video editing projects in a single file. Instead, it saves the configuration files that comprise a project in Resolve's installation directory. However, if you want to manually back up a project, you can export the project as a DRP file. You can do this by selecting File → Export Project... from Resolve's menu bar.",
      "NOTE: If you save your project as a DRP file, keep in mind that you will also have to retain copies of the media files your project contains, as DRP files contain only a record of a project's timeline, edits, and settings."

      "A DRP file stands for DaVinci Resolve Project file, created specifically by Blackmagic Design’s DaVinci Resolve software. This file format is used to store all the necessary data to load a video editing project inside Resolve. However, it’s important to note that DRP files don’t directly contain video, audio, or media files. Instead, they contain references to the media files that are part of your project.\n\nFor example, when you are editing a video in DaVinci Resolve, the DRP file records all the changes, effects, timeline edits, and color grades, but it doesn’t embed the media files themselves. Think of the DRP file as a detailed set of instructions or a project blueprint.",
      "A DRP file is a project file created by Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve, a video editing and color correction program. It contains data used to load a video editing project in Resolve, as well as the project's properties. DRP files do not directly contain any video, audio, or other media files. Instead, they contain references to the media files a project includes."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "To open a DRP file in DaVinci Resolve, launch the software and go to the Project Manager. Click on Import Project and locate your DRP file on your system. Select it, and the project will load into DaVinci Resolve. Ensure that the media files (videos, audio, images) referenced in the project are accessible, as DRP files only store the project settings and timeline, not the actual media. If media files are missing, you may need to relink them manually by navigating to the new file paths. Make sure you’re using a compatible version of DaVinci Resolve.",
      "You can open a DRP file in Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve (multiplatform) by selecting File → Import Project... from the program's menu bar. If you edit your project and want to back up your changes, you'll have to re-export the project as a new DRP file."

  "how_to_convert": {
    "instructions": [
      "If you want to back up your project or move it to another system, exporting your project as a DRP file is the way to go. Here’s how:\n\nIn DaVinci Resolve, navigate to the File menu.Select Export Project….Save the DRP file to your desired location.\n\nThis exported DRP file contains the timeline, edits, color grading, effects, and overall project properties, but not the media. You’ll need to make sure you also transfer or keep copies of the media files used in your project. The DRP file will reference these media files from their original locations.\n\nImportant Notes When Working With DRP Files\n\nIt’s essential to remember that DRP files only contain a project’s data and settings. If you transfer a DRP file to another computer, the project will only open successfully if the media files it references are also available. If the original file paths have changed or if the media files are not transferred along with the DRP file, the project may display missing media warnings.",
