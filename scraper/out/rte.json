      "Russell Cook developed RTEncoder in the early 2000s, and it became popular in the Poser community for securely distributing copyrighted files and modifications. However, alternative methods emerged for securing files, leading the software to decrease in usage among Poser users. Cook no longer develops the software."

      "A file with .rte extension is an encoded file used to exchange copyrighted files. These are data files compressed and encoded to ensure the protection of such files. The compression standard of these RTE encoded files can vary and reduce the file size accordingly. The compression and encoding mechanism ensure the security of the copyright content. The RTE file format is reliably used for exchange of copyrighted content over the internet or through storage media devices like DVDs, CDs, USB flash drives, and external hard disk drives.",
      "An RTE file is encoded by RTEncoder, a now-discontinued utility for encoding copyrighted content users can securely share. It is saved in the proprietary RTEncoder (RTE) format, which was designed to ensure no user alters, accesses, or distributes the content without authorization. Content creators and distributors were the primary users of RTEncoder, using it to share sensitive files and maintain control over their intellectual property."
