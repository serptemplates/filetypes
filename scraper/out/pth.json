      "PyTorch is a Python-based machine learning library that allows developers to create machine learning models. Developers save PyTorch models using the torch.save(model, PATH) command. Typically, PyTorch models are saved as .PT or PTH files.",
      "PTH files are meant to be used to perform a task. For example, many image upscaling applications use the algorithms that PTH files contain to increase an image's size while retaining its original quality. Typically, these applications will allow you to select and import a PTH file and use the file to perform a task."

      "A PTH file is a machine learning model created using PyTorch, an open-source machine learning library. It contains algorithms used to automatically perform a task, such as upscaling or identifying an image. PTH files can be used in a variety of machine learning and algorithm-related applications, but are most commonly used to upscale images."

      "Developers using PyTorch (multiplatform) can load a PTH file using the model = torch.load(PATH) command. Users attempting to import a PTH file into an application should follow that application's instructions for importing a PTH file. For example, Cupscale (Windows) users can import a PTH file using the application's Model 1 and Model 2 selection boxes."
