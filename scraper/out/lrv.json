      "These files are also used for previewing with GoPro mobile applications, for playback via Wi-Fi, or as the streaming buffer when a smartphone is used as a control device.",

      "An LRV file, also known as Low-Resolution Video file, is a video file format that contains lower resolution version of video, commonly used in video editing workflows and video production to create low-resolution copies of high-resolution video files, are used to facilitate faster and smoother editing processes, especially when working with large video files or on systems with limited processing power.\n\nLRV files are typically generated by camera systems, such as GoPro cameras, which create a lower-resolution version of original video during recording process, allowing users to quickly review footage, perform basic editing tasks and make selections without the need to handle larger, high-resolution files.\n\nThe LRV file format often uses H.264 or H.265 video compression codecs to reduce the file size while maintaining reasonable level of quality, but they are still capable of providing a decent preview of the content. Regardless of the camera’s settings, LRV video is consistently recorded at a resolution of 240p with a frame rate of 29.97 frames per second.",
      "An LRV file is a Low-resolution Video file saved in the MPEG-4 video format. Some GoPro cameras, including the GoPro HERO2 and HERO3, create LRV files. These cameras also create corresponding high-definition (HD) videos."

      "To open and view LRV (Low-Resolution Video) files, you can follow these steps:\n\nRename to MP4: To open and play an LRV file, you can easily do so by renaming the file extension to .MP4 and using any application capable of playing .MPEG4 video files.Video Editing Software: The most common way to open and work with LRV files is by using video editing software. Most professional video editing software, such as Adobe Premiere Pro, Final Cut Pro, or Davinci Resolve, are capable of recognizing and importing LRV files. Simply import the LRV files into your project, and you’ll be able to preview and edit the footage.GoPro Software: GoPro provides its own software called GoPro Quik, which is designed specifically for working with GoPro footage. You can download and install GoPro Quik from the official GoPro website. Once installed, open the software, import your LRV files, and you’ll be able to view and edit them within the application.Media Players: While LRV files are not typically meant for direct playback, you can use certain media players capable of playing these files. VLC media player is a popular choice that supports various video formats and codecs. You can download and install VLC, then open the LRV file directly through the media player.File Conversion: If you prefer to convert LRV files to a more widely supported video format, you can use video conversion software. Tools like Handbrake or Freemake Video Converter allow you to convert LRV files to formats like MP4, which can be opened by a wide range of media players or video editing software.",
      "To play an LRV file, simply rename the file to .MP4 and open it with any application that can open .MPEG4 video files."
