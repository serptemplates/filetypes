      "Because RMGC files are formatted as SQLite databases, they can be read and edited using third-party SQLite database management tools. However, you'll likely have a much easier time opening and editing an RMGC file in RootsMagic or RootsMagic Essentials. RootsMagic Essentials is available for free and allows users to create and print a basic family tree. The full, paid RootsMagic program includes a number of additional features, including the ability to search for unknown family members, view your family tree as a timeline, and publish your family tree to the web."

It contains an SQLite-formatted database that stores information about a user's family. RMGC files store family members' names, ages, birth dates, death dates, and relationships with other family members, as well as other information."
