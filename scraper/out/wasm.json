      "A WASM file contains binary code saved in the WebAssembly format that is run in web browsers, such as Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Microsoft Edge, and Apple Safari. It stores a module, which is binary WebAssembly code that has been compiled from C, C++, or Rust textual code, that can be imported into webpages and apps and used via JavaScript."
