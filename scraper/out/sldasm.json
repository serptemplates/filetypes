      "Product designers and engineers use Dassault Systemes SolidWorks to design 3D product prototypes. For example, an engineer might use SolidWorks to create many different prototypes of a new car engine. In SolidWorks, these prototypes are referred to as assemblies.",
      "To create an assembly, SolidWorks users create or import parts, saved as SLDPRT files, and then combine them. After creating an assembly, users can save the assembly as an SLDASM file. They can also use SolidWorks tools to troubleshoot their assembly's construction and render the assembly as a 2D drawing (.SLDDRW file)."
