      "Workstation and Fusion are applications that allow you to run multiple operating systems, including Windows and Linux, as virtual machines (VMs) on a Mac. In addition, VMware introduced the Teams feature when it released Workstation 5 to allow you to manage multiple VMs in different environments better.",
