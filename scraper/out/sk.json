      "You will most likely only encounter an SK file if you use the Skript plug-in with Minecraft to adjust or add gameplay features. You may also receive an SK file via email or cloud storage service from another Minecraft gamer who utilizes Skript and is looking to share a script with you.",

      "An SK file is a script file written in the Skript language, which is used to write scripts that modify gameplay in Minecraft. It stores plain text code that is run by the Skript plug-in in Minecraft when an event in the game triggers it, such as the action of a player or passage of a certain amount of time in the game."

      "You can also use a plain text editor bundled with your operating system. In Windows, you can use Microsoft Notepad or Microsoft WordPad, and in macOS you can use Apple TextEdit."
