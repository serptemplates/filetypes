      "An FMPSL file is a snapshot file of database created with FileMaker Pro 12. It stores the queried results from the database along with other information such as visual layout and visible information. The FMPSL file can be used to restore all this data in another instance of FileMaker Pro database. This file format was introduced with the launch of FileMaker Pro v 12. Prior to this version, the snapshot links were introduced as FPSL file format in FileMaker Pro v 11. FMPSL files can be opened with FileMaker Pro Advanced software. Other file formats supported by FileMaker Pro include FP5, FP7, and FMP12.",
