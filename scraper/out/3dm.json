      "A file with .3dm extension is an open-source file format that is used for 3D graphics software. It contains 3D models along with their dependent elements such as surface, points, and curve information. 3DM file format was developed by openNURBS initiative for accurately transferring 3-D geometry between applications. 3DM files can be opened and converted with applications such as Rhinoceros, SAP VEViewer, Moment of Inspiration, and Right Hemisphere Deep View.\n\nThe 3DM file format is quite popular among designers, architects, and engineers who depend heavily on NURBS-centered 3D modeling because 3DM files keep smooth geometry intact and fit perfectly into CAD, CAM, and 3D printing setups. Almost every major modeling program can open or save a 3DM file, so it can be used for collaboration easily and safely between teams working on different systems.",
      "A 3DM file is an open-source 3D model format and native file format for Rhinoceros. It contains a 3D model which includes surface, points, and curve information. 3DM files allow CAD, CAM, CAE, and computer graphics software to accurately save and exchange 3D geometry using both NURBS and polygon mesh representations."
