      "An A6PROJ file is a project created by version 6 of FOREVER Artisan, a program for designing scrapbooks, photo books, and calendars. It stores information about all of the elements of a project in the .XML standard, including the number of pages in the project, dimensions, and metadata. FOREVER introduced A6PROJ files when it released version 6 of Artisan, replacing ARTPROJ files Artisan version 5 creates to save projects."
