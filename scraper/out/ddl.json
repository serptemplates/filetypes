      "A file with .ddl extension is a Data Definition Language file that is used to define the schema of a database. It contains statements/commands for working with database structures such as tables, columns, records, and other fields. Commands in a DDL file are written in SQL and can perform operations such as create table in database, drop and update. A database schema is owned by its created and all the CRUD operations can be performed on it. Popular applications that can create and open DDL files are Windows Text Editor, Jetbrains Intellij Idea, and EclipseLink.",
      "Database file created in the Data Definition Language (DDL), a language used for describing database schemas; saved in a plain text format and contains commands such as CREATE, USE, ALTER, and DROP; often used for configuring data sources used by data-driven applications."
