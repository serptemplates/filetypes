      "Godot Engine is a free and open-source game engine used to develop 2D and 3D games. The game engine initially used .SHADER files to store shader properties, but now also supports GDSHADER files with the release of Godot Engine 3.3.3 on August 19, 2021.",

      "A GDSHADER file contains shader properties run on a computer's GPU to draw mesh data on the screen to realistically shade 2D and 3D elements featured in a game developed by Godot Engine. Shader properties in a GDSHADER file are data types and functions in the Godot shading language, which is based on the OpenGL ES (GLSL ES) 3.0 shading language."

      "If you develop a game with Godot Engine, you can open and edit the files with its built-in script editor. You can also open and modify GDSHADER files with a source code or plain text editor."
