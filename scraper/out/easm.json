      "An EASM file is a 3D CAD assembly file created using Dassault Systèmes eDrawings Publisher, a plugin that allows users to export models from various CAD applications. It stores multiple parts that comprise a larger assembly, such as an engine or gearbox, in the eDrawings Assembly (EASM) format, which is based on the HOOPS Stream Format (.HSF). EASM files allow users to send 3D models to others in a format that is easier to share and view than other proprietary 3D formats."
