      "The DuckDuckGo web browser is a privacy-minded browser published by DuckDuckGo. While the browser is downloading a file, such as a video, image, or audio file, it appends the .duckload extension to that file's name. For example, as the file example.jpg is being downloaded, it becomes example.jpg.duckload. After the download finishes, the browser automatically removes the .duckload extension.",
      "If you encounter a .duckload file and are not currently in the process of downloading a file, it is likely you stopped a download or a download was interrupted. Thus, DuckDuckGo never removed the .duckload extension from the file's name."
