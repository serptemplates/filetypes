      "Ancestry.com released Ancestry Family Tree in 2001 as a free Windows application for managing family tree information. The program allows you to add family members and information about them, such as their name, birth date, and birthplace, then save the information in an AFT file.",

Family Tree Maker supported the AFT format up to version 2005 SE of the software. Since the AFT format is no longer developed, AFT files are rare."
