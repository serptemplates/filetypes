      "OASIS (Organization for the Advancement of Structured Information Standards) released the ODT format in 2005 as part of the OpenDocument Format (ODF) 1.0 specification. The organization developed ODT to provide an open, XML-based alternative to proprietary document formats like Microsoft Word's .DOC and DOCX.",

The ODT format remains widely used in LibreOffice Writer and Apache OpenOffice Writer among users (often students) who prefer free, open-source software over commercial alternatives like Microsoft Word.",
