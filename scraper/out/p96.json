      "Trunked radio systems are systems that contain one or more control channels and a number of other, associated frequencies. In these systems, while a user's two-way radio is tuned to the control channel, their radio automatically broadcasts using one of the associated, trunked frequencies.",
      "Radio scanning enthusiasts use trunk tracking scanners, like the PRO-96 and PRO-2096, to scan and log activity on trunked systems. These enthusiasts can then use associated software, such as Win96, to log, analyze, edit, and export the data they've collected using their trunk tracking scanner. This data is typically saved in proprietary database formats, such as the P96 format."

      "A P96 file is a database created by Starrsoft Win96, a program used to read and modify data from Radio Shack PRO-96 and PRO-2096 trunk tracking scanners. It contains a record of the channels, frequencies, and other data associated with a trunked radio system. P96 files are saved in a proprietary format, used only by Win96."
