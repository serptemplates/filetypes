      "LEGO Digital Designer is a Windows and macOS program that allows LEGO enthusiasts to construct and save virtual LEGO models. LDD also allows users to create building guides for their creations, making it easy to re-create virtual models in real life.",
      "LDD saves LEGO models in LXF files. These files are archives that contain a PNG preview of the model they describe and an LXFML file that lists a model's name, what version of LEGO Digital Designer was used to create it, what bricks the model contains, and what positions those bricks are placed in. However, the bricks and positions listed in a model's LXFML file are not easily identifiable, so if you want to see how a model is constructed, you are best off opening the model's LXF file in LEGO Digital Designer.",
