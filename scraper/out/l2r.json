      "Since L2R files do not contain actual video they cannot be played by video players. However, you can use gaming screen capture programs such as Open Broadcast Software (OBS Studio) or Fraps to record the replay when you play it back in Lineage II. You can then save the recording in a more common video format.",

      "An L2R file is a replay file created by Lineage II, a fantasy massively multiplayer online role-playing game (MMORPG) for Windows. It contains a replay of Lineage II gameplay, such as a fortress siege or open field battle. L2R files do not store actual video, instead, they store a set of instructions read by the game to replay the action."
