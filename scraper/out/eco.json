      "The “ECO” file format is associated with the NetManage ECCO (Enterprise Core Objects) application. ECCO was a personal information manager (PIM) and database software that allowed users to organize and manage their data in a flexible and customizable manner. It was popular during the 1990s and early 2000s.\n\nThe ECCO database files have the extension “.eco” and contain structured data stored in a proprietary format. The application allowed users to create custom data fields, forms, and views to organize their information efficiently. However, ECCO was eventually discontinued, and support for the application and its file format may have diminished over time.",
