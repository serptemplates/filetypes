      "The GandCrab virus is ransomware, where the purpose of the virus is to take your computer files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator (typically via DASH currency) to unlock your files. The GandCrab V4 virus scrambles, renames, and encrypts the user's files. It then generates a .TXT ransom note (GDCB-DECRYPT.txt) informing you of the file encryption and what you need to do to recover your files."
