      "No single developer standardized the VOL game archive format. Instead, several game development studios used and implemented the format in various forms during the 1990s and early 2000s. Most notably, it was used by Dynamix, a game studio under Sierra On-Line, in titles such as EarthSiege 2 and the Tribes series. Later, Planet Moon Studios used a variation of the format in Giants: Citizen Kabuto.",
      "Each developer typically implemented a custom version of the VOL format tailored to their game engine's needs, so while the .vol file extension remained the same, the internal structure could differ significantly between games. As a result, VOL files from different games are often not interchangeable and may require game-specific tools to extract or modify."

      "A VOL file is an archive used by various video games, including Tribes and Earth Siege 2, to store game data in a single, compressed package. It may contain textures, sounds, maps, models, scripts, and other assets needed by the game. Game developers use VOL files to organize and compress game resources, which helps reduce loading times and simplifies file management."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "VOL files are not meant to be opened. Instead, the game packaged with the VOL file references it to load its contents.",
      "However, players or modders sometimes extract the contents of a VOL file to modify or replace game assets. For example, you can use Dragon UnPACKer to unpack assets in VOL files in Windows. However, not all games using VOL files support modification, and editing these files may corrupt them."
