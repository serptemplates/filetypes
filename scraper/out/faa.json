      "David J. Lipman and William R. Pearson created the FASTA format and released it in 1985. Biochemistry students, academics, and professionals often work with FAA files when storing and processing bioinformatics information.",
      "FAA files are one of several files saved in the FASTA format. Examples of other files are .FASTA, .FAS, and .FA.",
      "The FASTA format begins with the > character in the header, followed by a sequence identification code. The following line is the sequence itself, which may be more than one line."

    "description": [
      "An FAA file stores a record of one or more nucleic acid or protein sequences saved in the FASTA format. Each sequence includes an identification code and the sequence in plain text. Various DNA sequencing applications support the format, and text and source code editors can also open the format."
