      "In November 2021, developer Dominic Szablewski released the QOI format. The format is intended to be an open-source format that is easier to implement and faster to use than PNG.",
      "Specifically, QOI images can be encoded 20 to 50 times faster than similar-sized PNG images, and they can be decoded 3 to 4 times faster. Each QOI image includes a 14-byte header, which identifies the image as a QOI file and specifies the image's width, height, included channels, and colorspace."

      "A QOI file is a raster image saved in the Quite OK Image Format (QOI). The image it contains is losslessly compressed and saved in a 24-bit RGB or 32-bit RGBA format. QOI files are the same size as similar .PNG files, but can be encoded and decoded more quickly."
