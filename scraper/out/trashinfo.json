      "When a user trashes a file on various Linux operating systems, such as KDE, GNOME, or Mint, those OS's Trash applications create a TRASHINFO file that records the trashed file's previous location. If the user decides to restore the trashed file, Trash uses the associated TRASHINFO file to determine where the trashed file should be restored to.",
      "As such, if you delete a trashed file's associated TRASHINFO file, your Trash application will not be able to restore the trashed file. Linux TRASHINFO files are typically stored in the ~/Trash/info directory."

It contains a record of the location at which a file was stored before being moved to the Trash. It also records the date and time at which the file was trashed. TRASHINFO files are used to restore trashed files to their previous, pre-Trash locations."
