      "Because RMD files can contain both markdown-formatted text and chunks of R code, statisticians and data scientists use them to create dynamic presentations, reports, and other documents. This allows these users to write their reports, embed R-based data summaries within them, and export the reports to a more usable format, using just one file.",
      "Using RStudio, you can convert R Markdown files to a number of other formats, including .HTML, .PDF, .DOCX, and .PPTX. When R Studio converts an RMD file to another format, it executes the code contained within the file, creating the graphs or other data summaries that appear in the converted file."

      "An RMD file is an R Markdown file created using RStudio, an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the R programming language. It contains YAML metadata, Markdown-formatted plain text, and chunks of R code that, when rendered using RStudio, combine to form a sophisticated data analysis document."
