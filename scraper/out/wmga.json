      "WMGA files differ from .MGA files, which contain all of the embedded document resources. The advantage of WMGA files is that readers can download much smaller file sizes. Additionally, manga authors can update the remote content on-the-fly and have it distributed to all readers automatically. However, the disadvantage is that readers must allow the document to download on-demand as they read the comic.",
      "Web manga document files are stored in a .ZIP format. Therefore, you can decompress them with any ZIP decompression utility.",
      "NOTE: WMGA files can be created with the Manga Creator application that is included with the Manga Reader installation."
