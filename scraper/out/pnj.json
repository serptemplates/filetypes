      "The PNJ format is a hybrid of the .PNG and JPEG formats. Each PNJ file contains JPEG-encoded image data saved within a PNG container. This allows PNJ files to include an alpha channel, like PNG files, while still being compressed using lossy compression (reducing their file size in comparison to PNG files).",
      "The PNG Development Group created the PNJ format for use alongside the .MNG (Multiple-Image Network Graphic) format. Each MNG file can be comprised of multiple PNJ files, used to show an animation. However, both MNG files and PNJ files are quite uncommon. Thus, most image viewers and editors cannot open PNJ files.",
      "NOTE: During development of the MNG format, the PNG Development Group renamed the PNJ format to the JPEG Network Graphic (.JNG) format."

      "PNJ stands for Portable Network JPEG. It is an image file format that combines the features of JPEG (lossy compression for smaller file sizes) and PNG (support for transparency). This hybrid format compresses image data using JPEG’s lossy compression but stores it in a PNG container, allowing for transparency (alpha channel). The format was created by the PNG Development Group for use in animations within MNG (Multiple-Image Network Graphics) files. However, the PNJ format was eventually renamed to JNG (JPEG Network Graphic), and both PNJ and JNG are rarely used today.",
      "A PNJ file is an image saved in the Portable Network JPEG (PNJ) format. PNJ files are similar to normal .JPG files, in that they contain image data compressed using lossy compression. However, unlike typical JPGs, PNJ files can contain transparent sections."

      "Opening a PNJ file (Portable Network JPEG) can be tricky, as it’s a rare and largely obsolete format. Since PNJ files were later renamed to JNG (JPEG Network Graphic), support for them is limited in modern software. However, you can try the following methods:\n\nRename the File Extension\n\nTry renaming the file extension from .pnj to .jng. Some software that supports JNG files might be able to open it. To do this:Right-click on the file.Choose “Rename” and change .pnj to .jng.Confirm the change and try opening it with compatible software.\n\nUse Image Viewers that Support JNG\n\nSince JNG is more widely recognized than PNJ, you can use specific software known to support it:\n\nXnView or IrfanView: These are free image viewers that support a wide range of image formats, including JNG.GIMP (GNU Image Manipulation Program): This open-source image editor may support JNG files.\n\nConvert the File\n\nIf you’re unable to open the file directly, you can try converting it using online file converters like Convertio or Zamzar. Upload the PNJ file and attempt to convert it to a more common format, such as PNG or JPEG.\n\nOpen with a Hex Editor\n\nIf the file still doesn’t open, try using a hex editor to inspect the file contents. This will allow you to see the raw data and potentially identify its format. If the file is mislabeled, this may give clues for how to properly open it.",
      "You may be able to open a PNJ file with XnViewMP. While XnViewMP does not officially support the PNJ format, it can open many types of image files, including .JNG files (to which PNJ files are related).",
      "At this time, there is no known program that officially supports the PNJ format."
