      "Vidomi is a free MPEG-2, DVD, and SVCD player and conversion tool that, among other things, allows users to convert videos to the DivX (.DIVX) and Xvid (.XVID) formats. Before they convert a video, users can specify many conversion-related settings by selecting Vidomi's Options button.",
      "If a user wants to save their current Vidomi settings, so they can quickly load those settings when converting videos in the future, they can do so by selecting File → Save Settings. This saves the user's current settings in a VIDOMI file. VIDOMI files are plain text files, but because settings are defined using variable numerical values, you likely should not edit a VIDOMI file's contents in a text editor. Instead, you should load the file in Vidomi and then edit its settings as necessary."
