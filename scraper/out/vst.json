      "Steinberg developed the Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plug-in interface to allow Cubase users to create and install custom audio effects. For example, users can install VST plug-ins that emulate various instruments or produce unique reverb effects. Many other DAWs, including Ableton Live, Image-Line FL Studio, and Audacity, also allow users to install effects saved in the VST format.",
      "Many VST files are packaged with accompanying FXP and FXB files. FXP and FXB files contain effect presets, which can be loaded in their associated plug-in. These presets allow editors to quickly begin using a polished version of the effect a VST file contains.",
      "NOTE: The VST format was replaced by the .VST3 format."
