The pen and receiver pick up your movements along with the pressure level of your pen strokes, as you sketch and convert them into a digital image, which is the WPI file. The image can then be viewed and edited with Inkling Sketch Manager, which also lets you export the image to Photoshop, Illustrator, and SketchBook Pro for further editing.",
