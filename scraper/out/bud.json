      "Most users will only see this file because they have encountered a printing error. The error usually occurs after they install a new OEM printer driver, service pack that updates the Unidrv.dll file, system update, or printer hotfix on a server in Windows 2000 or Windows 2003 server. The BUD file must be given time (up to several hours) to successfully regenerate or else the user may receive a message that says the print queue is full when they're trying to print something."
