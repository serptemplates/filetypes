      "VMLT files often appear after a computer crash or a failed installation of a Windows service pack. When the correct codec is unavailable to play the PMB or WMM video project files, they are converted into a folder that contains a VMLT and .VMLF file. If this occurs, open the VMLT file with the GSpot utility, which tells you about the file and whether the codecs are installed.",
