      "Bloons Tower Defense is a series of multiplatform tower defense games published by Ninja Kiwi. While most games in the series pit players against the game's AI, Bloons Tower Defense Battles pits players against each other. In Battles, one player chooses what bloons to send through a maze, while the other player places towers to pop those bloons and prevent them from escaping the maze.",
      "Players deploying bloons have access to certain bloons sets throughout the game. Each of these sets is associated with a BLOONSET file. A BLOONSET file specifies the type of bloons a bloon set includes and some of those bloons' characteristics. It also specifies the bloon set's cost."
