      "VSDC Video Editor allows video editors to import videos, audio, and images, edit and enhance those assets, and combine them into movies. Editors can place each asset in its own layer upon VSDC Video Editor's timeline, clip, trim, or extend each asset, and add a variety of visual effects to their movie, including transitions and color styles.",
      "When a video editor saves a VSDC Video Editor project, the project is saved as a VPROJ file. VPROJ files do not actually contain the assets imported into a VSDC Video Editor project. Instead, they contain references to the locations at which the project's assets are stored. If you move an asset used in a VSDC Video Editor project, your VPROJ file may not open correctly in VSDC Video Editor.",
      "After an editor finishes editing their video, they can export their finished project as an .AVI, .MPG, .MOV, or .MKV file, among other video formats. VSDC Video Editor allows editors to select the device their video will be played on, so the editor can export their video in a format optimized for that device."

It contains references to the video, audio, and image assets a project includes, as well as a record of the project's layers, timeline, effects, and edits. VPROJ files can be opened only in VSDC Video Editor."
