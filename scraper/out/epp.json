      "An EPP file is a project created by TalaSoft TalaPhoto, a now-discontinued image organization and sharing program. It contains information about a photo project, including a list of selected images, their thumbnails, and settings related to how the project will be shared or exported. EPP files act as a container for organizing the structure and layout of a user’s photo set without storing the original image files themselves."
