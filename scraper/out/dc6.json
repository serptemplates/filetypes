      "A DC6 file is a graphics file used by Diablo II, an action role-playing game released in 2000 by Blizzard Entertainment. It stores a graphic in DC6 format, which supports single and multi-frame images and is displayed during gameplay. DC6 files are used for animations and user interface (UI) elements, such as inventory items and background panels."

      "While Blizzard Diablo II uses DC6 graphics for various aspects of gameplay and UI elements, you cannot open DC6 files directly with the game.",
      "If you are looking to modify DC6 files, you can convert them to the .PCX bitmap image format with DC6Con in Windows, then edit them with an application that supports PCX images, such as Adobe Photoshop or Corel Paintshop Pro. You can then convert the PCX files back to DC6 files with DC6Con or DC6 Creator."
