      "Adobe XD is a design application that UI and UX designers use to prototype website and mobile application frontends. XD allows designers to create basic wireframes and more finalized mockups, which simulate the pages of a website or screens of a mobile application. Each page or screen is typically placed on its own XD artboard.",
      "Designers can use a variety of tools to animate their artboards and link them together. This allows designers to simulate the interactions users will have with a website or application. For example, a designer can place a Log In button on one artboard and link that button to an artboard prototyping their app's Login screen. Then, when the designer opens their prototype in XD's Preview mode, they can click the Log In button to be taken to the Login screen.",
      "XD files are most often used to refine a website or mobile application's UI before developers start developing the site or app. For example, a UI designer might use an XD file to present a proposed website design and workflow to their web development team. Developers often use the assets (images, fonts, and other elements) included in XD files during the development process, to ensure the website or application they create matches their UI designer's prototype."

      "A file with .xd extension is a mockup created for website or mobile applications using the Adobe XD software. Designers, creative teams, and organizations use these files to design applications by referring these. A single XD file contains design elements such as images, shapes, and text that provide complete feature set to develop fast and intuitive wireframe prototypes for developers to start developing these as applications.",
      "An XD file is a website or mobile application mockup created using Adobe XD, a user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) design tool. It contains one or more artboards, which themselves contain layer-based graphic design elements, such as images, shapes, and text. XD files are used to prototype the look, feel, and workflows of websites and mobile applications, before developers begin developing those sites or applications."
