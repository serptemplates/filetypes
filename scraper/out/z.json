      "The Z file is a file that supports the archive file format. It is one of the first file types that provide fast, and lossless data compression and decompression using the Unix and Linux operating systems. In some operating systems, a file extension with the lowercase Z (.z) represents a GNU-compressed file, while a file with the uppercase Z (.Z) represents a compressed file. The Z file has several versions that it supports, such as 2.0, 2.1, 4.5, 4.6, amongst others. There are various algorithms in different Z file versions, and the most popular one is DEFLATE.",
      "Z files have mostly been replaced by GNUzip compression, which creates .GZ files. Unix users can use the znew utility to recompress Z files to GZ files."

      "A Z file is a category of files belonging to the UNIX Compressed data files. Compressed Unix files are the most popular and widely used extension type of the Z file. Z file makes formatting, running and opening of files easier as they are used to create small computer files that can be easily run on Linux/Unix operating systems. It is beneficial for users looking to save disk space, as by compressing large files into one Z file, users can save a lot of storage space and make their files more organized. These compressed Z files can be easily decompressed in the Unix system by using a simple command “uncompress abc.z” for a file named “abc”.",
      "Compressed file used to store, or \"pack,\" files on Unix-based machines; incorporates a simple compression algorithm that is used to archive files and save disk space; can be decompressed on a Unix system by typing uncompress filename.z, where \"filename.z\" is the name of the file to decompress."
