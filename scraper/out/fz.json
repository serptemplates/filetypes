      "Fritzing is a PCB design application that Arduino and other PCB enthusiasts use to create PCB layouts. These layouts are saved as Fritzing projects, or FZ files.",
      "Users can view FZ files three different ways in Fritzing. Fritzing's breadboard view shows the circuit much as it would look in real life, the schematic view shows the circuit as a circuit diagram, and the PCB view allows users to design and export the documents necessary to produce a physical copy of their circuit board.",
      "If a user wants to share their project with another Fritzing user, they can export the project as an FZZ file. The FZZ file is a Zip-compressed file that contains all the data a user needs to import a project into Fritzing."
