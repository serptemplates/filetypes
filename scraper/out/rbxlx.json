      "An RBXLX file contains a location that defines a place in Roblox, an online multiplayer building game. It stores XML information that describes a Roblox playing area, which includes 3D models (.RBXM files), tools, parts, teams, and scripts. RBXLX files are similar to .RBXL files but are saved in XML format, which helps reduce the file size."
