      "An XGT file contains a texture used by a video game developed using the Exient XGS Engine. The image an XGT file contains may be uncompressed, and saved in the RGA 8888 or RGBA4444 formats, or compressed, and saved in the ETC1, DXT1, ATC, or PVRTC formats. Angry Birds Go! and Angry Birds Transformers are examples of games that use XGT files."
