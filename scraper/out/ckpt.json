      "PyTorch Lightning is a Python library that acts as an interface for PyTorch, a popular machine learning framework developed by Meta. It allows developers to run deep learning experiments and create scalable deep learning models.",
      "While creating a model, developers can save that model's current state as a CKPT, or checkpoint, file. Doing so allows the developer to revert to and use that version of the model in the future. Each CKPT file contains everything needed to load that version of the model, including its current epoch, global step, and LightningModule's state_dict."
