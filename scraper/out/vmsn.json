      "VMware Fusion and VMware Workstation are virtualization applications that can run multiple VMs on a single machine. VM snapshots save a VM state you can revert to in case something happens to the VM. For example, you can save a fresh installation of a guest operating system (OS) as a snapshot and revert to the clean OS install even after installing applications.",

For example, you can take a snapshot in Fusion by selecting Virtual Machine → Snapshots... → Take Snapshot, then Fusion creates the VMSN file in the .VMWAREVM file, which you can find in the following location (Fusion saves it here by default):",

VMware virtualization software creates a VMSN file when a user takes a snapshot of a VM, which allows them to revert a VM to a saved point. VMSN files are saved with a .VMSD file, which contains the metadata for the snapshot."
