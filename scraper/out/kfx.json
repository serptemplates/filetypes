      "A KFX file is an eBook created in the Kindle Format 10 (KF10), Amazon's successor to the .AZW3 (Kindle 8) format. It contains an Amazon eBook, which includes the text and metadata describing the book, such as the author, title, and number of pages. KFX files support enhanced typesetting capabilities that are not provided in previous formats, such as hyphenation, improved character placement and word spacing, and a more adaptable page layout and margins."
