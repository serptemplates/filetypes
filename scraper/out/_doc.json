      "Another reason why a _DOC file may be created by an email program, such as Windows Live Mail, is if the filename ends with a \".\" before the \".\" in the extension. For example, the email program changes sample..doc to sample._doc. This also commonly occurs with .DOCX, .XLS, and .XLSX files.",
      "You can rename _DOC files by changing the \"._doc\" extension to \".doc\". After renaming the file, you can open it as a standard DOC file. Some programs that can open DOC files are Microsoft Word, Corel WordPerfect, LibreOffice Writer, and Apple Pages."

      "A _DOC file is a Microsoft Word document with the .doc extension changed to ._doc. It is a .DOC file, which may include formatted text, images, graphs, tables, and charts. _DOC files may be renamed to \"._doc\" files by an email program to prevent the file from being blocked by an email service."
