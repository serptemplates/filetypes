      "Web feeds are files that contain a list of a website's recent updates, typically saved in an XML format. When a user publishes an update to a website that uses a web feed, they (or their website's content management software) also update its feed to include a summary of the new content. Users subscribed to the website's feed are then notified of the new content.",

      "In most cases, users who subscribe to an Atom feed will never need to view an ATOM file. Instead, they can simply enter the URL of a website's ATOM file into their Atom feed reader, to subscribe to the feed the file describes.",
      "However, in some cases, users may download the current version of an Atom feed as an ATOM file. For example, a web developer may want to download a website's Atom feed as an ATOM file to inspect the feed's structure or troubleshoot feed issues."

      "An ATOM file is a Syndication format for the structure of Atom feed and entry documents. Similar to .RSS files, ATOM file format is an XML-based syndication format that is a standard for publishing content. An ATOM file is used for web feeds that allow software programs to check for updates that are published on the website. It contains entries that can be of different types such as headlines, full-text articles, excerpts or links to content on a website\n\nApplications that can open ATOM files include Apple Safari.",
      "An ATOM file contains a website feed saved in the Atom Syndication Format. This feed consists of XML-formatted data, which lists the website's recent articles (or other content). You are most likely to encounter an ATOM file in your web browser, when viewing a website's Atom feed."
