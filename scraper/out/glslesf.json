      "OpenGL for Embedded Systems, or OpenGL ES, is an extension of the standard OpenGL API. It is used primarily to render 2D and 3D graphics on embedded systems such as smartphones, tablets, and video game consoles. However, it is also used in some desktop applications, such as Google Earth Pro.",
      "Like the standard version of OpenGL, OpenGL ES uses fragment shaders to render graphics with color, shadows, and other effects. These fragment shaders are plain text files that contain directives written in GLSL. While there is no standard file extension for OpenGL ES fragment shaders, they are sometimes saved with the .glslesf extension.",
      "NOTE: OpenGL fragment shaders are also saved as .FSH or .GLSL files."
