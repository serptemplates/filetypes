      "WeChat is an instant messaging, social media, and mobile payment application developed by TenCent. Originally released in 2011, WeChat has grown to become one of the most popular apps used within China. However, WeChat routinely sends users' data to the Chinese government, which has led other countries to either discourage or outright ban use of WeChat.",
      "While what, exactly, is stored in WeChat's XLOG files is unknown at this time, users often report that these files take up a large amount of space on their mobile devices. Notably, XLOG files are not deleted when users clear WeChat's cache, so WeChat users must delete XLOG files manually if they want to remove the files from their devices."

      "At this time, there is no known program that allows WeChat users to open XLOG files. Because the files cannot be opened, take up a large amount of space on mobile devices, and may be used to send records of your app activity to the Chinese government, you should delete XLOG files regularly."
