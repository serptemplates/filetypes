      "The KML format was originally developed by Keyhole, Inc. for Keyhole Earth Viewer, a mapping program that was acquired by Google in 2004. The format eventually became a worldwide standard for geographic annotation and visualization in 2D and 3D geographic mapping programs. KML files are primarily associated with the Google Earth web application and Google Earth Pro desktop program. They are also supported by other mapping applications, such as Blue Marble Geographics Global Mapper and ESRI ArcGIS Pro.",
      "Most KML files are created with Google Earth or Google Earth Pro. To create a KML file in Google Earth, click the \"Projects\" icon in the left pane, select \"Create,\" and choose \"Create KML file.\" To create a KML file in Google Earth Pro, select File → Save → Save Place As..., then choose \"Kml\" from the dropdown menu.",
      "Since KML files are saved in plain text, users may create KML files from scratch or by copying features from Google Earth Pro. To do this, right-click a feature in the 3D Viewer of Google Earth Pro and select Copy, then paste it into a TXT file open in a text editor. Users can then save .TXT files, and change the .txt file extension to .kml.",
      "NOTE: Users may save KML files as .KMZ files, which are Zip-compressed to save space when sharing the files with other users."

      "A KML file stores geographic modeling information in the Keyhole Markup Language (KML), which is a geographic information systems (GIS) data format based on XML. It includes placemarks, points, lines, polygons, and images. KML files are used to identify and label locations, create different camera angles, overlay textures, and add HTML content (links, font styles, etc.)."

      "Since KML files are saved in a plain text, XML-like format, you can open them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (macOS).",
      "NOTE: You can also open a KML file in Google Maps by hosting it on an online location and then typing the URL in the Google Maps search box. For example, if you host your KML file at http://mywebsite.com/myfile.kml, then type this URL in the Google Maps search box to display it.",
      "Alternatively, you can construct the URL yourself in Google Maps by prefixing your KML file's URL with http://maps.google.com/maps?q=. For example, to open the same KML file from above, you can use the following URL:",
      "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://mywebsite.com/myfile.kml",
      "This procedure also works for Google Earth View, the 3D earth-browsing plug-in you can add to your web browser."
