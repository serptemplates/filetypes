      "The JMCE file is similar to the .JMC file format but is created using additional JM-Crypt \"Exchange\" encryption. This method uses common asymmetric key pairs (one public and one private). It also uses an auto-generated password and instant selfie or a random key generated for symmetric encryption and electronic ID card certificate for a signature. The random key is created by JM-Crypt Security's homemade fast Fourier transform (FFT) key generator.",
      "The JMCE file is used to encrypt sensitive business files and confidential personal files. JM-Crypt also uses the .JMCX, .JMCK, and .JMCP files for encrypting files.",
      "NOTE: In order to decrypt the JMCE file, you need the JM-Crypt software and algorithm that were used to originally encrypt the file."
