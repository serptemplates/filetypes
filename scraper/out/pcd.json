      "Kodak developed the PCD format to enable users to preserve their physical photographs in a digital format on a Photo CD. Users could then insert the Photo CD into the computer to view and edit their images with an image editor or archive them.",
      "PCD images scanned with Kodak photo processing hardware are typically scanned at a resolution of 3072 x 2048 pixels. However, the images may also be scanned at 6144 x 4096 using Kodak's Pro Photo CD service. Both formats support 24-bit color.",
      "PCD files typically contain five copies of the image at different resolutions, and Pro Photo CD images contain an additional sixth image that is 6144 x 4096 pixels in size. The smallest image size is 192 x 128 pixels, and this image is used as a thumbnail for browsing all the photos on the CD at once."
