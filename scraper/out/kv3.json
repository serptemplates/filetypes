      "KV3 stands for KeyValues3, which is a Valve-developed data format that is similar to JSON and XML. However, KV3 files also support binary encodings, versioning, and data annotations. They also include support for some additional text syntax.",
      "Each KV3 file begins with a line that contains a kv3 encoding header. It then goes on to define how a game object behaves. For example, bt_default.kv3 is a KV3 behavior tree, which defines how CS:GO bots behave in deathmatches. Bt_default.kv3 contains references to other KV3 files, stored in CS:GO's scripts/​ai/​modules directory. Those KV3 files contain scripts that bots execute to perform in-game actions."
