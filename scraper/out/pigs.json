      "Indigo Renderer and Indigo RT are 3D apps that allow artists to create photorealistic images. However, Indigo RT offers fewer features and is less expensive than Indigo Renderer.",

      "You can create a PIGS file with Indigo Renderer when saving a scene you want to share or store. To create a PIGS file with Indigo Renderer, open an IGS file, select File → Save Scene As, then select \"Packed Indigo Scene\" from the file type dropdown menu."

      "A PIGS file is a packed 3D scene (.IGS file) used by Glare Technologies Indigo Renderer and Indigo RT, multiplatform 3D visualization apps. It stores an IGS scene in a Zip-compressed format that decreases its size, making it more convenient to share or store."

This is helpful for accessing the IGS file if you do not have Indigo Renderer or Indigo RT."
