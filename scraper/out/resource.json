      "A RESOURCE file is an archive used by games and applications built with the Unity game engine. It stores chunks of data in a proprietary format extracted from various assets, such as textures, sounds, 3D models, and shaders, that Unity references to load and run a game. RESOURCE files are typically generated when a user builds and packages a Unity project for release, allowing the game to load required content efficiently during gameplay."
