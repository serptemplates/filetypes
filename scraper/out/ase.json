      "ASE and ASEPRITE files are saved in the same format and are the most common files associated with Aseprite. The files are created to store the sprite graphic or animation and can be closed and re-opened for further editing in Aseprite.",

      "A file with a .ase extension is an Autodesk ASCII Scene Export file format that is an ASCII representation of a scene, containing 2D or 3D information while exporting scene data using Autodesk. Autodesk provides options to include scene components while exporting scene data. You can include Mesh definition along with vertex and face information, Material description, transform animation data for the objects, complete mesh definition of every n frames, animation data for cameras and lights and IK joint settings.",
      "An ASE file contains a sprite created by Aseprite, an animated sprite editor and pixel art tool. It stores a 2D animation or graphic, which includes layers, frames, palettes, tags, and settings. ASE files may also be saved as .ASEPRITE files."
