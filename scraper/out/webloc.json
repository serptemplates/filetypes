It is generated by dragging the web URL from browser’s address bar to desktop or any other folder where it is meant to be saved. The URL to destination site is stored inside this shortcut file and can be viewed by opening the file in a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, Notepad++, or Apple TextEdit. WEBLOC files are similar to the URL files.",
