      "An XCFBZ2 file is an archive compressed with the Burrows-Wheeler compression algorithm (bzip2) that contains an .XCF image created by the GIMP image editor. It is a .BZ2 archive that users export from GIMP when backing up XCF images or transferring to another location. XCFBZ2 files are more commonly saved as .XCF.BZ2 files."

However, you may need to rename the .xcfbz2 file extension to .bz2 before decompressing an XCFBZ2 file. Possible options include bzip2 (multiplatform), Apple Archive Utility (Mac), 7-Zip (Windows), and PeaZip (multiplatform)."
