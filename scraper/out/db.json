      "A file with db extension is a generic database file to store data. There are no official specifications to be followed for such a database file. Data is organized in a structured format inside the file in the form tables, fields, data types, and field values. DB files can also be created by reading from data sheet files having data in rows and columns. Contents of DB files can further be exported to CSV and PDF file formats for reporting purpose. DB files can be opened in applications such as SQLite and LibreOffice.",
      "Mobile devices, such as Android and iOS mobile phones, store a variety of information in DB database files. For example, a DB file may contain your contacts, your SMS information, or other device or application data. DB files are commonly saved in a SQLite database format, but they are also commonly locked or encrypted, so you cannot access or edit their data."
