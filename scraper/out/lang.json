      "When developers create a program intended for use in multiple regions, they often translate the program's text into each of those regions' languages. This process is called localization.",
      "One way developers localize programs is by creating multiple, language-specific text files that map the programs' text strings to each language's version of that string. The program can then refer to the correct file when showing in-game text, based on the user's language setting. Minecraft uses LANG files to show localized text to users.",
