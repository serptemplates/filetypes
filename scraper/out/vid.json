      "Because VID files are now used infrequently, some programs that previously supported opening and playing VID files no longer do so. For example, you can no longer open and play VID files using Apple QuickTime Player, and Microsoft Windows Media Player does not recognize the .vid extension by default."

      "A VID file is an old file format used to store video data for games developed by Bethesda Softworks. The company has developed several games and used the VID file format for storing game recordings. In addition to video, these can also store audio data related to the game. Some of the famous games by Bethesda using VID file format include Skynet and The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. Bethesda software doesn’t support VID file format anymore.",
      "A VID file is a generic video file that has been saved in one of many possible video file formats. Often, the file’s extension has been changed from its original extension to .vid. For example, a user might have renamed a file like clip1.mov to clip1.vid in an attempt to play the video using their preferred media player."
