      "Haxe is an open-source, general-purpose programming language used to create video games, web applications, mobile applications, and cross-platform desktop applications. Notably, Haxe is used in the HaxeFlixel game engine, which is an open-source game engine used to develop 2D games.",
      "Previously, Haxe developers used HXPROJ files to store configuration information about their Haxe projects. The Haxe compiler then used these HXPROJ files to build developers' projects. However, Haxe projects now more commonly use the HXML format for storing configuration information."
