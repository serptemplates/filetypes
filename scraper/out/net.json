      "You most likely will only encounter netViz NET project files if you work in a business setting and use netViz to visualize data related to large information systems. The software was used in the 1990s and 2000s but is no longer developed. Therefore, NET files are rather obscure nowadays.",
      "NET project files are the main file type associated with netViz and can only be created and opened with the program. The file type is the most well known among netViz users since the files store saved projects and are opened directly by users when opening projects.",
      "NOTE: Example projects included with netViz software are often called \"Global Network.net\" or \"Global.net.\""
