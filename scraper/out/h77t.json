      "M77T data and H77T files are created from raw data collected by marine researchers using InfoBank, a structured information storage scheme of databases and software. The raw data is collected by researchers studying underwater depth of lake and ocean floors, which is known as bathymetry. A M77T and H77T file, along with other metadata files, are used to transmit data to and from a data center for analysis.",
      "The H77T file will bear the same name as the associated M77T file. If the M77T file is named j295gb.m77t, the H77T file is named j295gb.h77t.",
