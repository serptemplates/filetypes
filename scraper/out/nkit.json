      "An NKIT file contains a complete copy of data extracted from a Nintendo Gamecube or Wii game saved in the Nintendo Toolkit (NKit) format. It is a compressed .ISO ROM file that reduces the excess and unnecessary data in a ROM file. NKIT files can be played on a computer with various emulation programs, such as Dolphin, Swiss, and Nintendont."
