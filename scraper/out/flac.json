      "FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec) is a revolutionary lossless audio coding format developed by the Xiph.Org Foundation. As a completely royalty-free and open-source format, identified by the .flac file extension, it offers a significant advantage in digital audio storage and fidelity. The powerful FLAC compression algorithm efficiently reduces the size of digital audio files by an impressive 50 to 70 percent. Most importantly, this compression is entirely lossless, meaning FLAC files can be decompressed into a perfect, bit-for-bit identical copy of the original source, preserving every detail of the audio quality without any degradation.",
      "A FLAC file is an audio file compressed in the Free Lossless Audio Codec (FLAC) format, which is an open-source lossless audio compression format. It is similar to an .MP3 file, but is compressed without losing any quality or original audio data."
