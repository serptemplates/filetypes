      "An MCPACK file is a resource or behavior pack that modifies Minecraft (Bedrock Edition), a popular block-building video game. It contains multiple resource files, such as .PNG and .JSON files, and is compressed with Zip compression. MCPACK files are typically used to transfer resources between Minecraft users."

      "Since MCPACK files are saved in a .ZIP format, they can be expanded using any Zip decompression utility. Simply rename the file's .mcpack extension to .zip and use a Zip decompression program to expand the file's contents. Some Zip decompression programs include Corel WinZip (cross-platform), 7-Zip (Windows), Apple Archive Utility (Mac), and B1 Free Archiver (cross-platform).",
