      "The file extension \".gitkeep\" is not a part of the official Git standard but has come about by convention with some Git users. The extension name is considered a good choice because it is the opposite of .GITIGNORE, which is an official Git file extension that tells Git which files to ignore when committing to the repository."

      "A GITKEEP file is an empty file that Git users create so that a Git repository preserves an otherwise empty project directory. By convention, empty directories that contain no files are not committed to Git repositories. However, a single GITKEEP file in a directory causes Git to preserve the directory in the repository."
