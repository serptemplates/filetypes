      "WLMP files are typically used to create personal videos for sharing with friends and family. In Windows Live Movie Maker, you can export WLMP projects to .WMV files, publish them to YouTube, and burn them to DVDs.",
      "Windows Live Movie Maker was initially released in 2000 as part of the Windows Essentials software suite. It is primarily used to create and edit videos then share them to YouTube, Facebook, Vimeo, Flickr, or OneDrive.",
      "However, in 2012, Microsoft discontinued the Windows Live name and the program became known as just Windows Movie Maker. Microsoft then discontinued Windows Movie Maker replacing it with the Photos app that comes with Windows 10. The app includes the ability to create and edit videos with music, text, and 3D effects. The Photos app does not support the WLMP file format."

      "WLMP (Windows Live Movie Maker Project) is a proprietary file format used by the Windows Live Movie Maker application to save movie projects. It contains information about the arrangement of video clips, photos, and audio tracks in a project, as well as the effects and transitions applied to them. WLMP files cannot be played on media players, they need to be exported as a video file format such as WMV or MP4 to be played.\n\nThe actual content of a WLMP file is stored in an XML (Extensible Markup Language) format and includes information about the project such as the size and length of the video, the location and duration of each media clip, the applied transitions and effects, and other project-related details. The XML code in the WLMP file describes the sequence of events in the movie project and serves as a blueprint for the final video production. However, the WLMP file itself does not contain the actual media files such as video clips and audio tracks, but rather the references to their location on the computer’s hard drive.",
      "A WLMP file is a movie project created by Windows Live Movie Maker, a program that allows users to create movies and slideshows. It contains paths to video, movie transitions, images, music, and effects featured in the movie project. WLMP files do not contain the actual content that appears in the movie project, only links to the content."
