      "Delphi utilizes DCU files to expedite the compilation process. Instead of recompiling source files every time, the compiler can reuse existing DCU files when the source code has not changed. This helps developers working on large projects with many source units save time during repeated builds.",

      "A DCU file is a compiled unit created by Embarcadero Delphi, a software development environment used to build Windows applications. It contains machine code compiled from a Pascal source file (.PAS) using the Delphi compiler. DCU files typically share the same name as their source file, for example, compiling module.pas generates module.dcu."

Developers typically work with the human-readable PAS files, while the compiler handles the creation and use of DCU files behind the scenes."
