      "Apple created the PICT format for use with QuickDraw, a 2D graphics library and API used by previous versions of Mac OS. Two versions of the PICT format, PICT 1 and PICT 2, exist. PICT 1 supports up to eight colors. PICT 2 supports 24- and 32-bit color (up to millions of colors).",
      "While the PICT format is a vector format, PICT files can contain embedded raster images. Many PICT files contain only a single embedded raster image and do not contain any vector data.",
      "NOTE: PICT images that use the .pct extension were likely created on a Windows computer. PICT images created on Macs typically use the .PICT extension."

      "A PCT file is a Macintosh Picture Image file format that was the default file format for Apple QuickDraw programme. It was developed by Apple but after the discontinuation of QuickDraw programme, it is no more in use. PDF, at large, has replaced the PCT and similar file formats. PCT files can also be sometimes found with .pict file extension, though both PCT and PICT have the same file format.",
      "A PCT file is an image saved in the Macintosh PICT format, which Apple developed in 1984. PCT files can contain vector or raster images. The PCT format has been deprecated, so PCT files are uncommon."
