      "DAA (Direct Access Archive) is a proprietary file format for disk image files developed by PowerISO Computing. DAA supports features like compression, password protection, and splitting into multiple volumes. The advantage of using DAA instead of ISO is that DAA files are smaller in size and can be split into multiple files. DAA is also secure to transfer as it can be encrypted and password-protected.",
      "Proprietary disk image file format used by PowerISO, a disk imaging application; can be compressed, encrypted, password protected, and split into multiple volumes; used for mounting virtual file systems as disk drives, as well as protecting sensitive data."

    "instructions": [
      "Since DAA is a proprietary format, it’s primarily supported by PowerISO. Open the DAA file with PowerISO and either mount it as a virtual drive or extract its contents."

  "how_to_convert": {
    "instructions": [
      "If you need broader compatibility, you can convert a DAA file to an ISO format using PowerISO. Converting to ISO will allow the file to be used by other image-mounting software."
