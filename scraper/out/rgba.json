      "In 1995, developer Paul Haeberli created the SGI, or Silicon Graphics Image, format. This format is used to store various kinds of RGB images, saved with many different extensions.",
      "SGI images saved with the .rgba extension contain three color channels (red, green, and blue) and a fourth, alpha channel. The alpha channel sets the transparency of the image's pixels. Each pixel can be anywhere from 0 to 100 percent transparent. This allows users to layer an RGBA image over another image, to produce a composite image via transparency."

      "An RGBA file is a color bitmap image saved in a file format created by Silicon Graphics (SGI). It contains binary data used to show an image using the RGB color model and an alpha channel. RGBA files are similar to .RGB files, except RGB files do not include an alpha channel."

  "how_to_convert": {
    "instructions": [
      "Most image viewers and editors that can open RGBA files can convert them to other image formats. For example, XnViewMP can convert RGBA files to the following formats (and many others):",
      ".JPEG - JPEG Image",
      ".GIF - Graphical Interchange Format",
      ".PNG - Portable Network Graphic",
      ".TIFF - Tagged Image",
      ".BMP - Bitmap Image",
      ".PCX - Paintbrush Bitmap Image",
      ".TGA - Targa Graphic",
      ".JP2 - JPEG 2000 Core Image",
      ".JXR - JPEG XR Image",
      ".WEBP - WebP Image",
      "Keep in mind that some of these formats do not support transparency, so the converted version of your image may not remain transparent."
