      "ConceptDraw DIAGRAM can create diagrams documenting simple and complex processes, from business procedures to healthcare challenges for an ethnic group. The CDDZ format is the default format for saving diagrams (File → Save), and once you save a CDDZ file, you can close it and then re-open it for further editing.",
      "Besides drawing and settings information, CDDZ files may also contain program code written in a scripting language called ConceptDraw Basic, which allows users to manipulate drawing objects automatically. The code is commonly used to automate repetitive tasks.",
      "NOTE: CS Odessa introduced the CDDZ format when it released version 10 of CS Odessa ConceptDraw PRO, then changed the name of the software to ConceptDraw DIAGRAM. Version 9 and earlier of CS Odessa ConceptDraw PRO uses the .CDD file format to save documents."
