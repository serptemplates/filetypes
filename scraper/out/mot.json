      "Various industries, including TV, film, advertising, architecture, and video game development, use LightWave 3D to create 3D graphics and animations. You can add keyframes to an animation in the app to configure how the object or camera moves.",
      "When Lightwave 3D reads the keyframes stored in a MOT file, it interpolates the movement between them to create a fluid animation. To save a motion in a MOT file with LightWave 3D, select Save → Save Motion File.",

      "A MOT file contains a 3D motion created by LightWave 3D, a professional graphics application for rendering animated and still 3D images. It saves one or more keyframe coordinates in plain text for an object or camera, including its location, rotation, and scale. LightWave 3D users save and load MOT files to preserve movements they can re-apply to other objects or cameras."

      "You can open MOT files with LightWave 3D in Windows and macOS. For example, to open a MOT file in the Layout utility included with LightWave 3D, select Load → Load Motion File.",
      "Since MOT files store motion information in plain text, you can also open them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (macOS). Remember that you may break the motion animation if you incorrectly modify it."
