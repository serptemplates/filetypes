      "Rofi is a window switcher, run dialog, menu system, and SSH launcher available for Linux operating systems. Rofi users can configure a number of program-level settings, including which features the program shows, which theme the program uses, and which font the program uses, by specifying them in config.rasi.",
      "The themes that users specify within config.rasi are also saved in RASI files, which are named themename.rasi. RASI theme files contain many color, window, and other UI-related settings, while RASI configuration files contain only a handful of program-level settings (including the modi, theme, font, and combi-modi settings), making the two types of RASI files easy to tell apart. RASI configuration and theme files are both saved in the ~/​.config/​rofi directory."
