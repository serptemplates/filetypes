      "KiCad uses KICAD_WKS files in its schematic editor to display the title block and border when viewing or printing schematics. Users can create or modify these files to include project-specific information, such as company names, revision numbers, or document identifiers. KiCad then applies the customized sheet to one or more schematic pages within a project, ensuring a consistent format for documentation and communication."

      "A KICAD_WKS file is a custom drawing sheet created by KiCad, an open-source software suite for designing electronic schematics and printed circuit boards (PCBs). It stores information in a text-based format that defines the layout and appearance of a schematic's title block and border, including elements such as text fields, logos, and frame lines. KICAD_WKS files allow users to standardize the look of their schematic sheets across multiple projects."
