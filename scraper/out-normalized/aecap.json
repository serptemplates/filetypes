      "AECAP templates are created by After Effects for use in Premiere Pro video editing software. You can import an AECAP file in Premiere Pro using the Media Browser tool included in Premiere Pro or by selecting File → Import and choosing the AECAP template. Any edits you make to the text template in Premiere Pro will be saved in the AECAP file.",
      "To export an AECAP file in After Effects, create your composition then select File → Export → Composition as Text Template or Composition → Export Composition as Text Template. Once you export the AECAP file, you cannot edit it in After Effects.",
      "NOTE: AECAP templates were introduced with the release of Adobe Creative Cloud (CC) 2017 in versions 14.0 and 14.1 of After Effects. However, Adobe soon replaced AECAP templates in later versions of After Effects with .MOGRT templates. Premiere Pro still supports the AECAP templates but they can no longer be created in After Effects."
