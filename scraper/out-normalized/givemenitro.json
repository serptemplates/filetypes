      "GIVEMENITRO files are encrypted files, so they cannot be opened normally. To restore your files to their normal state, you must first retrieve the decryption key needed to decrypt your files. Then, you must enter the key in your ransom message's Decrypt files field.",
      "The executable (likely an .EXE file) that infected your computer with Nitro ransomware contains your decryption key. If you are not a skilled programmer, you can post a link to the program that infected your computer (as well as an explanation of how you encountered it) on a reputable anti-malware forum, such as the forum found at BleepingComputer.com. There, a helpful programmer may help you extract your decryption key."
