      "QVF files are used to store visualizations of data, such as sales numbers or personal information. However, you will most likely only see the actual QVF file when sharing your data visualization app with another Qlik Sense Desktop user. They are often shared as an email attachment or uploaded to the cloud but it is important to note that QVF files often become large in size, making them difficult to attach to an email.",
      "When creating a QVF file you will import data from one or more files or connect a data source. If you share the QVF file, the app cannot be reloaded unless the other user has access to the data source too.",
      "QVF files are typically located in the following directory:",
