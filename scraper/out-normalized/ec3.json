      "Dolby Laboratories developed the EC-3 format, also known as Dolby Digital Plus, as a successor to the Dolby Digital Audio Codec 3 (AC-3) format (.AC3 files). Some of the improvements over the AC-3 format include support for more channels (increased from 5 to 15 full-bandwidth channels) and a wider range of data rates (increased from 32 kbit/s to 768 kbit/s).",
      "NOTE: Dolby Digital Plus is natively supported by Windows 11 and Windows 10, and across Apple platforms, such as macOS, iOS, and tvOS."
