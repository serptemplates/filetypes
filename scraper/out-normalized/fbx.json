      "The text-based file structure is a tree-structured documented with clearly named identifiers. It consists of a nested list of nodes arranged in hierarchy where each node has:\n\nA NodeType identifier (class name)A tuple of properties associated with it, the tuple elements are the usual primitive data types: ##float, integer, string## etc.A list which contains nodes in the same format (recursively).\n\nThese can be represented logically as follow:\n\nNodeType: SomeProperty0a, SomeProperty0b, ... , { NestedNodeType1 : SomeProperty1a, ... NestedNodeType2 : SomeProperty2a, ... , { ... Sub-scope } ... }\n\nSome of the standard nodes are defined as implicit list where each item consists of a nested list. Any application, that intends to access FBX geometry, has to parse these contents and make useful meaning of it.

      "While the FBX format is proprietary, many non-Autodesk modeling and animation applications can open FBX files. This allows creators to share 3D models in the FBX format, which is efficient because it stores models as binary data.",
