      "Z00 split archives may be created by various compression utilities to shrink the size of large files for transfer or archival purposes. Split archives are especially useful when transferring files via e-mail attachments because emails have significant file size limitations.",
      "However, with the advancement of Internet speeds and cloud storage capabilities, split archives are not as common or necessary as they once were. Users can upload their files to a cloud storage space, such as Google Drive or Dropbox more easily and share a link with the recipient who can then download the files."
