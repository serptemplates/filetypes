      "TrollStore is a third-party iOS app installer available for iPhones and iPads. It allows users to install IPA files distributed outside the Apple App Store (typically, via unofficial online app repositories).",
      "In some cases, users may wish to AirDrop an IPA file to their iOS device, for use with TrollStore. However, AirDrop does not allow users to transfer files that use the .ipa extension. To circumvent this limitation, TrollStore's developer updated the app to be able to install IPA files that use the .tipa extension. Thus, users can rename an IPA file to use the .tipa extension, AirDrop it to their iOS device, and install it with TrollStore."
