      "Veritas developed the Global Image (GI) file format, which Sonic Solutions later acquired. Sonic RecordNow and Roxio Easy Media Creator were two popular disc-authoring and burning applications in the early 2000s that adopted the GI format. Both programs allowed users to create, copy, and manage CDs and DVDs.",
      "RecordNow and Easy Media Creator could write GI files to blank discs, and users could mount them as a virtual drive, allowing users to access their contents without needing the physical disc. They could also split GI files into multiple parts, especially when dealing with larger DVDs.",
      "As disc-burning technology evolved and .ISO became the standard format for disk images, the use of GI files declined. However, users who created backups or copies of media using Sonic or Roxio software may still encounter GI files in old archives."
