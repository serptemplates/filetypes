      "FLIF is an alternative to PNG, WebP, JPEG2000, JPEG-LS, lossless JPEG XR, MNG, APNG, GIF, and lossless BPG formats and boasts a better compression ratio. The format supports RGB, RGBA, and grayscale with a color depth of 1 to 16 bits per channel.",
      "The FLIF format is made up of 4 parts:",
      "Main header - Contains metadata about the image, such as the height, width, depth, and number of frames.",
      "Optional metadata chunks - Contains non-pixel data, which includes an ICC color profile, encoded with DEFLATE compression.",
      "Second header - Contains information detailing how the pixel data is encoded.",
      "Pixel data - Contains pixel information encoded with MANIAC entropy coding.",
      "More information about the format can be found here.",
      "NOTE: The FLIF format was originally released in October of 2015 as an alpha release. The first stable version was released in September 2016."
