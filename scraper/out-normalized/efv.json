      "Ensoniq released the VFX-SD in 1989 as an improvement upon the VFX synthesizer it released earlier in the year. The VFX-SD included updated features, such as a floppy drive, a 24-track sequencer, and improved sounds.",
      "Additionally, the VFX-SD sequencer came with editing tools, allowing users to arrange notes and patterns to compose a song saved as an EFV file. After composing sequences, users could transfer and share EFV files via floppy disks."
