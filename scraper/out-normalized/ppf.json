      "CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2024 does not natively support opening .ppf (Picture Publisher Image File) files, as the .ppf format is specific to Picture Publisher. While CorelDRAW can handle various graphic formats, direct compatibility with .ppf is not guaranteed. If you need to use a .ppf file in CorelDRAW, you have a few options. First, you can convert the file using an image conversion tool to a more widely accepted format, such as JPEG or PNG, which can be opened in CorelDRAW. Alternatively, you can open the .ppf file in Picture Publisher and then export or save it in a format compatible with CorelDRAW."
