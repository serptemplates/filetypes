      "CERBER2 files are similar to .CERBER files but are created by the Cerber2 virus. Cerber2 is a variant of the first version of the Cerber virus and encrypts files differently than the Cerber virus to make it difficult for users to decrypt infected files. CERBER2 files became prevalent in 2016 and are similar to .LOCKY and .ZZZZZ files that are created by Locky ransomware.",
      "Cerber2 is dangerous malware that is often referred to as ransomware, where the purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay bitcoins to the perpetrator in order to decrypt your files. The virus is commonly spread through email spam that includes infected attachments or malicious links. Once the virus affects your computer it begins scrambling your files, renaming them with random characters, and encrypting them as CERBER2 files.",
      "When encrypting your files, the virus creates .TXT, .HTML, and .VBS files that contain instructions for paying the criminals. These files are placed in each folder that contains CERBER2 files."
