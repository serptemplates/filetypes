      "Microsoft Loop is an online collaboration service that, among other things, allows users to add collaborative components within various Microsoft 365 apps, so they can interact with text together. For example, co-workers conducting a team chat in Microsoft Teams can post and vote on a poll, or they can paste in a piece of text and edit it together in real-time.",
      "When a user creates a new Loop component within a Microsoft 365 app, Loop saves that component as a LOOP file. Each user's LOOP files are stored in their Microsoft OneDrive for Business storage, so the user can quickly access and open them at any time.",
      "NOTE: In the past, LOOP files were saved as .FLUID files."
