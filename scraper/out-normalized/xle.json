      "XLE files are created by Levelogger Software from measurement data transferred from Levelogger Edge and Levelogger Junior Edge devices. After you transfer data from the devices, you can view the data in Levelogger Software and create the XLE file to store the data. You can export the measurement data as an XLE file, LEV file, or .CSV file.",

      "You can open an XLE file in the Levelogger Software for Windows, Solinst app for iOS, and Solinst Levelogger App for Android. To open the XLE file in the Levelogger Software, simply select File → Open, navigate to the XLE file location, and click Open.",
      "If you want to import data from an XLE file into a database program that does not support the XLE format you can rename the file as an XML file. To do this, simply rename the \".xle\" extension to \".xml\" and import it into the database program."
