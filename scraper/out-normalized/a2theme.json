      "NOTE: If you download an A2THEME file, you can double-click the file to install the theme, since Aston automatically registers the \".a2theme\" file association when installed. However, because A2THEME files are saved in the ZIP format, the Web browser may automatically assign the \".zip\" extension to the downloaded file. Therefore, you first need to change the extension to \".a2theme\" and then double-click the file to install the theme."
