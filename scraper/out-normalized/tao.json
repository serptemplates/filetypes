      "Track-at-once is a method of writing data to a CD-R or DVD-R. Programs that use this method write one track or title to a disc at a time, with run-out and run-in blocks recorded between each track. In contrast, programs that write discs using the disc-at-once (DAO) method write all data to a disc at the same time, often with no run-out and run-in blocks.",
      "Various CD and DVD authoring programs that can write discs using the TAO method can create and load TAO files. These files contain all of a track-at-once disc's contents, saved in a format that can be used to transfer those contents to a recordable disc."
