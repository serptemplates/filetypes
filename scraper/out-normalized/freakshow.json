These plug-ins are available for purchase on Freakshow Industries' website. Users can also \"steal\" the plug-ins, which provides them with the full version of the plug-in for free, with limitations on upgrades and support.",

Users can download their FREAKSHOW files from their Freakshow Industries account page. They can then use them to activate associated plug-ins."
