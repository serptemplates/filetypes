      "Engineers and product designers use Autodesk Inventor to create and test 3D prototypes of mechanical products. These prototypes are called assemblies. When an Inventor user wants to show off or receive feedback on an assembly (or the assembly's component parts, or multiple assemblies), they can create an Inventor presentation. Presentations consist of one or more scenes that show different views and/or animations of an assembly.",
      "For example, an Inventor user might create a scene that animates how an assembly's parts fit together. Or, they might create a scene that zooms in on a specific portion of their design, which they are hoping to receive feedback on. After a user has finished adding scenes to their presentation, they can export the presentation as an .AVI or .WMV video or a series of .PNG images, so other users can review the presentation.",
      "NOTE: If you modify a part (.IPT file), assembly (IAM file), or drawing (.IDW file) included in an IPN file, Inventor will automatically update the IPN file to reflect your changes."
