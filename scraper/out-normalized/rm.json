      "A RealMedia file consists of a series of chunks, each having the following structure:\n\ndword chunk type (FOURCC) dword chunk size, including 8-byte preamble word chunk version byte[] chunk payload\n\nThe following are the types of chunks present in the RealMedia file:\n\nRealMedia file header (.RMF): This must be the first chunk in the RealMedia file. Only one RMF chunk is present in one file. It contains information about the number of headers.File properties header (PROP): This contains information about the general properties of the RealMedia file. There is only one chunk of this type in each RealMedia file.Media properties header (MDPR): This chunk contains information about the stream properties. It contains information about the type of stream and the codec used. There is one MDPR chunk for each stream in the file.Content description header (CONT): This chunk contains text information like the title or author for the content in the RealMedia file. This chunk is for information purposes only.Data header (DATA): This chunk contains a group of data packets.Index header (INDX): This chunk comes after all the DATA chunks and contains index entries. One file can have more than one INDX chunks.",
      "RM multimedia content is streamed in constant bitrate, which means the bitrate remains the same during streaming. This is not optimal when streaming more complex segments of media data since the rate of data transfer remains constant. RealNetworks replaced the RM format with the RealMedia Variable Bitrate (RMVB) format, which enables media to be streamed in a variable bit rate, which allows data transfer at different speeds. This is useful in situations when the data transfer needs to be increased for more complex segments of media files.",
      "RM files that only store audio may be saved as RealAudio .RA files. Also, RM files that store audio and video, or only video, may be saved as RealVideo .RV files.",
      "NOTE: RM files may contain a URL link to a streaming media file instead of the actual audio or video data. These RM files are played back as they are downloaded.",
      "Users typically play RM media files with RealPlayer software but they may also open them with a variety of other audio programs, such as Eltima Elmedia Player or GRETECH GOM Player. VideoLAN VLC media player may also be used to play RM files but the software only provides partial support for the format. Users can also transfer RM files to RCA MP3 players to play them.",
      "There are numerous programs available to convert RM media files to other, more common formats. Some options in Windows include Applian Replay Converter and Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate. Aiseesoft Mac Video Converter Ultimate can be used in macOS."
