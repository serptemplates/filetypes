      "You will most likely only encounter a NAMES file if you download a database from an online repository. The NAMES file is typically created by one of the conductors of the study that collected the data. He or she publishes it with the database to help users better understand the data they are viewing.",
      "You can open the NAMES with any text editor. If you use Windows, you can open it with Notepad and if you use macOS, you can open it with TextEdit. Both programs are bundled with their respective operating systems."
