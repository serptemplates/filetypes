      "Mine-imator is a program that allows players to create animated movies using Minecraft assets, including characters, items, textures, and terrain. Animators can then export their movies as .MP4, .MOV, or .WMV videos, so they can share them via YouTube and other online video platforms.",
      "Whenever an animator creates a new Mine-imator animation, they also create a new, associated MIPROJECT file. While MIPROJECT files are primarily used to open animation projects in Mine-imator, the files are actually just text files, which contain references to the assets used and actions that occur within a movie, as well as other metadata."
