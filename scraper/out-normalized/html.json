      "An HTML 4 document is composed of three parts:\n\na line containing HTML version informationa declarative header sectiona body, which contains the document’s actual content. The body may be implemented by the BODY element or the FRAMESET element to contain the body in frames\n\nEach section can be lead or followed by white spaces, newlines, tabs and comments. An example of a simple HTML document is as shown below:\n\n<!DOCTYPE HTML PUBLIC \"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01//EN\" \"http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/strict.dtd\"> <HTML> <HEAD> <TITLE>Understanding HTML File Format</TITLE> </HEAD> <BODY> <P>Hello World! </BODY> </HTML>",
      "HTML was introduced in 1991 by Tim Berners-Lee and other CERN engineers as a way for web browsers to interpret and display webpages. Since its release, it has become a standard in web development and has gone through multiple revisions, which include HTML 2 (1995), HTML 3 (January 1997), HTML 4 (December 1997), and HTML 5 (2014).",
      "The Web Hypertext Application Technology Working Group (WHATWG) develops and advances HTML. The group was founded in 2004 and consists of major browser developers, including Google, Microsoft, Apple, and Mozilla.",
      "The markup language features HTML elements that make up the structure of webpages. Typically, each element includes an opening tag enclosed in angle brackets (<tag>) and a closing tag enclosed in angle brackets but with a forward slash preceding the tag (</tag>).",
      "Some examples of basic elements include:",
      "<head> - Head tag used to contain metadata about a webpage",
      "<body> - Body tag that defines the body of a webpage",
      "<h1> - Text header tag used to create a text title in a webpage",
      "<p> - Paragraph tag used to define a paragraph in a webpage",
      "<img> - Image tag used to embed an image in a webpage",
      "<ul> - Unordered list to create a bulleted list in a webpage",
      "<div> - Divider tag used to create a section in a webpage",
      "Over time, other web technologies, such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, have been introduced to enhance webpages. You will most likely find CSS or JavaScript code or references to .CSS or .JS files in modern HTML webpages.",
      "Web developers often create and edit HTML files, then upload them to web servers that web browsers parse when a user visits webpages. If you are an average Internet user, you most likely will not see the HTML source code since your web browser parses it in the background.",
