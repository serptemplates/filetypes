      "GRAPHISOFT Archicad is a building information modeling (BIM) application with various modeling capabilities. Architects commonly use the software to design building structures, including interiors, exteriors, and landscapes.",
      "Archicad has a default LCF library, but you may also create or open custom libraries with the software. For example, you can save all libraries and library objects that are loaded with an Archicad project into a single LCF file using the Archicad Library Manager (accessible by selecting File → Libraries and Objects → Library Manager...). One advantage of saving libraries in the LCF format is that they load two to three times faster than individual libraries.",
