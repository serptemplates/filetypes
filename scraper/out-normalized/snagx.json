      "TechSmith Snagit is a screen capture and image annotation program that technical writers and others use to take and annotate screenshots. For example, a technical writer documenting how to use a software program can take a screenshot of that program using Snagit and then add instructional text, shapes, and other annotations to the screenshot.",
      "If a user wants to continue editing a screenshot's annotations in the future, they can save the screenshot as a SNAGX file. The SNAGX format preserves Snagit annotations as editable objects. Users can also save screenshots as .PNG, .JPG, .TIFF, .GIF, .BMP, or .PDF files, but those formats do not preserve annotations as editable objects.",
      "NOTE: Prior to Snagit 2022, Snagit for Mac saved editable captures in the .SNAGPROJ format, and Snagit for Windows saved editable captures in the .SNAG format. As of Snagit 2022, both platforms' versions of Snagit save editable captures as SNAGX files."
