      "When a Red Hat, Fedora, or other Red Hat variant Linux user installs the updates contained in an RPM file, and the updates include changes to a CONF file the user has previously modified, one of two things typically happens. The package either overwrites the user's current CONF file and produces a similarly-named RPMSAVE file, which contains a copy of the user's previous configuration, or the package leaves the user's current CONF file in place and produces a similarly-named .RPMNEW file, which contains the modified CONF file's new default settings.",
      "Typically, RPM packages produce RPMNEW files, rather than RPMSAVE files. This ensures users' modified configurations remain in place after the update finishes. If a package instead produces an RPMSAVE file, the package likely includes necessary updates to users' configurations.",
      "NOTE: RPMSAVE files typically have the .rpmsave extension appended to the name of the CONF file they correspond to. For example, an RPMSAVE file that contains a user's previous configuration for the file httpd.conf would be named httpd.conf.rpmsave."
