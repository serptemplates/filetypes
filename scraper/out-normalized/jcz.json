      "Microsoft Liquid Motion enabled users to create interactive and animated content for websites without manually writing code. The software exported animations in the JCZ format along with the necessary Java applet files so users could embed them into webpages. This made JCZ files a helpful way to share lightweight, cross-platform animations at a time when web standards were still evolving.",
      "NOTE: Today, JCZ files are considered a legacy format since Microsoft discontinued Liquid Motion in the early 2000s, and modern browsers no longer support the Java plugins required to display JCZ animations."
