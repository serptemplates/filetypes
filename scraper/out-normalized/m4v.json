      "M4V files have continuous chunks with 8 byte header, 4 byte chunk size and 4 byte chunk type in each chunk. First chunk is “ftype” and has a sub-type at offset 8. M4V defined by sub-type which must be “M4V_”. Further chunks type are predefined signatures: “ftyp”, “mdat”, “moov”, “pnot”, “udta”, “uuid”, “moof”, “free”, “skip”, “jP2 “, “wide”, “load”, “ctab”, “imap”, “matt”, “kmat”, “clip”, “crgn”, “sync”, “chap”, “tmcd”, “scpt”, “ssrc”, “PICT”. Iterating chunks, until unknown type is detected, we compose M4V file.\n\nHere is an examination of a sample: A sample m4v file’s binary data is inspected through Hex Viewer and it can be observed that it starts with a signature ftyp (hex: 66 74 79 70) at offset 4, which defines QuickTime Container File Type. File sub-type is M4V_ (hex: 4D 34 56 20) which points to M4V (MPEG-4) file type. First block size is 32 (hex: 00 00 00 20, big-endian, high byte first), size located at offset 0. At offset 32 (hex: 20) is located the second chunk, which has a size of 30,322 (hex: 00 00 76 72, big-endian, lower-byte first) and type moov (hex: 6D 6F 6F 76). The next chunk is located at offset 32+30,322#30,354 (hex: 00 00 76 92) and has a size 8 (hex: 00 00 00 08) and type free (hex: 66 72 65 65).",
      "To play a protected M4V file, your computer must be authorized (using iTunes) with the account that was used to purchase the video. Unprotected M4V files may be recognized and played by other video players by changing the file extension from \".m4v\" to \".mp4.\""
