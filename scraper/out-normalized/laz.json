      "LAS files contain data about the Earth's surface, recorded using Light Detection and Ranging (LIDAR) technology. Because these files contain a large amount of data, scientists often find it useful to compress the files for more efficient storage and to make them easier to share with others.",
      "LASzip is a tool scientists can use to compress LAS files. It is included in the LAStools LIDAR data processing toolkit. When a scientist uses LASzip to compress a LAS file, LASzip saves the compressed version of the file as a LAZ file."
