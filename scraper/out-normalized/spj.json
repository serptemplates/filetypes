      "If you want to share a project with someone who does not own PhotoStage, you can burn the project to a DVD, upload it to YouTube, Vimeo, or Flick, or export it in another file format. Some multimedia formats you can export the project to include .MP4, .MOV, and .AVI.",
      "If you are moving an SPJ project to another computer or backing it up, you need to also copy the actual media files imported to the project since they are referenced in the project. If you select File → Back Up Project Files To Folder..., you can copy all the referenced files to a single location for backup or transfer."
