      "Windows spelling dictionaries are comprised of three files: a .LEX file, an .ACL file, and a .DUB file. The LEX file contains data used to check a user's spelling and grammar, the ACL file contains data used to auto-correct a user's spelling and grammar mistakes, and the DUB file contains a small amount of data that, potentially, is used to identify the dictionary's language. However, at this time, DUB files' true purpose is unknown."
