      "Space Engineers provides a feature called \"voxel modding\", which allows you to add asteroids into the game. To do this, type the \"Shift\" and \"F10\" keys to place an asteroid, then modify it with the provided voxel editing tools. When you save the world with the asteroid, a VX2 file is created by Space Engineers to store information about the asteroid."
