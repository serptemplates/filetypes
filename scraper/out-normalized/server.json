      "A common SERVER file is mysql.server, which is a script included with MySQL distributions on Unix and Unix-like systems. The mysql.server script can be found in the the same directory where MySQL is installed, which is /​usr/​share/​mysql/​ on a Unix system or /​etc/​init.d in macOS. The mysql.server script is used to start and stop a MySQL server.",
      "Another common SERVER file is mysqld_multi.server, which is typically located in /​etc/​init.d in macOS. The script can be used to start, stop, or obtain a status report from one or more MySQL servers.",
