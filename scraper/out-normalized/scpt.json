      "AppleScript was introduced in 1993 when system 7.1.1 of the classic Mac OS was released. It is built into all versions of macOS (OS X) and is utilized by end-users primarily to control applications and access or modify data and documents on the OS. However, average macOS users will never see the SCPT file.",
      "You can edit SCPT files with AppleScript, which is an editor packaged with macOS. The program comes with debugging capabilities and can handle other AppleScript files such as .APPLESCRIPT and .SCPTD."
