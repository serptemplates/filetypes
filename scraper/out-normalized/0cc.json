      "The 0CC format is similar to the .FTM format which is the primary format used by FamiTracker. The 0CC format can save more effects than the FTM format and allows Famicom to access multiple audio extension chips at the same time. Support for the 0CC format was added in version 0.3.14.4 of 0CC-FamiTracker.",
