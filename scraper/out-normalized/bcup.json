      "Buttercup allows users to create password vaults in which they can store, organize, and retrieve login credentials (usernames and passwords), payment methods, and other data. For example, a user could add their Amazon, Gmail, and online banking credentials to a Buttercup vault, and then copy their credentials from their vault when logging in to those services.",
      "Each Buttercup vault is saved as an encrypted, password-protected BCUP file. (When a user creates a new BCUP file, Buttercup prompts the user to create a password for that file.) Typically, users save BCUP files to Dropbox, Google Drive, or another cloud storage service, so they can easily access their BCUP files from different devices. However, users can also save BCUP files locally, so they can access their vaults without an internet connection."
