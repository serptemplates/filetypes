      "GitHub Pages is a tool that allows GitHub users to publish websites for themselves and their GitHub projects. Typically, GitHub Pages uses the Jekyll static site generator to build users' websites, prior to publication.",
      "For various reasons, however, users may not want to have GitHub Pages use Jekyll to build their website. For example, those who use Pelican to generate their GitHub Pages website(s) do not need to run their content through Jekyll. In these cases, users can add a NOJEKYLL file to their website's root directory (or another appropriate location). This tells GitHub Pages to not use Jekyll when publishing the user's website."
