      "JSON data is written in key/value pairs. The key and value are separated by a colon(:) in the middle with the key on the left and the value on the right. Different key/value pairs are separated by a comma(,). The key is a string surrounded by double quotation marks for example “name”. The values can be of the following types.\n\nNumberString: Sequence of Unicode characters surrounded by double quotation marks.Boolean: True or False.Array: A list of values surrounded by square brackets, for example[ \"Apple\", \"Banana\", \"Orange\" ] Object: A collection of key/value pairs surrounded by curly braces, for example{\"name\": \"Jack\", \"age\": 30, \"favoriteSport\" : \"Football\"}\n\nJSON objects can also be nested to represent the structure of the data. Given below is an example of a JSON object.",
      "The JSON format was originally based on a subset of JavaScript but is considered a language-independent format, being supported by many different programming APIs. JSON is commonly used in Ajax Web application programming. It is becoming increasingly popular as an alternative to XML.",
      "While many applications use JSON for data interchange, they may not actually save .json files on the hard drive since the data interchange occurs between Internet-connected computers. However, some applications do enable users to save .json files. One example is Google+, which uses JSON files for saving Profile data. After logging in, you can choose the \"Data liberation\" page and select \"Download your Profile data.\"",
      "Mozilla Firefox saves bookmark backups using JSON files. The files are saved to the Firefox user profile directory within a folder called bookmarkbackups. You can also make manual backups of Firefox bookmarks and import them into a different copy of Firefox. To import, open the bookmark Library, click the import/export button in the top bar, choose Restore → Choose File..., and then select your JSON backup file."
