      "NAV files are automatically generated by the game engine when a user first plays a map with bots. The loading process may take several minutes for large maps. You can manually start the NAV generation process by typing nav_generate in the game console. You can also edit navigation meshes manually by typing nav_generate 1 in the game console while \"sv_cheats\" is enabled.",
      "NAV files are similar to .AIN files, but AIN files are more commonly used for non-player characters (NPCs) instead of bots.",
      "NOTE: Example games that use NAV files include Quake 3 (id Tech 3 engine), Counter-Strike: Source (Source Engine), and Team Fortress 2 (Source Engine)."
