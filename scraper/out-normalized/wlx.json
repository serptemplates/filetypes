      "WLX filenames are created by appending the \".wlx\" suffix to the files that need to be synchronized. For example, if myimage.png needs to be synchronized from a remote location, Live Mesh creates a temporary file named myimage.png.wlx in the local directory. When synchronization is complete (when the file is downloaded), Live Mesh removes the WLX file.",
