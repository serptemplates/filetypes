      "Cellebrite's digital forensics suite allows investigators to extract data from a variety of devices, including smartphones, drones, and SD cards, analyze that data, and share their findings with other law enforcement professionals. UFED and Physical Analyzer are two of the suite's primary applications.",
      "Both UFED and Physical Analyzer allow investigators to extract a device's contents and save them as a single .UFD file. However, if investigators are extracting data from multiple related devices, they may instead save all of the devices' contents as a UFDX file. This allows investigators to load all the devices' data as a single file while building a case in Physical Analyzer, and more easily share the data with other investigators if needed."
