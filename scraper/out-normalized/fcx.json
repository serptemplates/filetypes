      "In 1988, Compact Data Works released the FCX file compression utility. Originally available for the VMS operating system, Compact Data Works later released versions of FCX available for Unix-based operating systems, MS-DOS, and Windows.",
      "Businesses used FCX to compress files to smaller sizes, making the files easier to transfer between computers. The FCX utility and file format predated the PKZIP utility and .ZIP files, which are now much more common. The FCX utility included many of the same options as the PKZIP utility, including the ability to create self-extracting archives and the ability to selectively add, remove, or extract files from an archive."
