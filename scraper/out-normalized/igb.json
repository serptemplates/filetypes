      "In 2003, game developer Vicarious Visions acquired rival developer Intrinsic Graphics. As part of that acquisition, Vicarious Visions gained ownership of Intrinsic's 3D game development platform, Intrinsic Alchemy Engine.",
      "Vicarious Visions (which was itself acquired by Activision in 2005) used the Intrinsic Alchemy Engine to produce many popular 3D games, including the X-Men Legends and Marvel: Ultimate Alliance series and Pirates of the Burning Sea. These games' character models and associated animations were saved as IGB files. Vicarious Visions also licensed the Intrinsic Alchemy platform to other game developers, who used it to produce models and animations for their own games."
