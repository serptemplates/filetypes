      "STOP ransomware, also known as STOP Djvu ransomware, is one of the most common types of ransomware. Typically, STOP ransomware encrypts users' files and produces a ransom message named _readme.txt, which contains instructions a user is supposed to follow to decrypt their files. The ransom message asks for a ransom of $980, unless the user contacts the ransomer in the first 72 hours after infection, in which case the ransom is halved to $490.",
      "In May 2019, some PC users reported their computers had been infected by a new variant of STOP that appended encrypted files with the .radman extension. This STOP variant encrypts users' files using an offline encryption key, so users can likely decrypt RADMAN files themselves using the Emsisoft Decryptor for STOP Djvu (linked below).",
      "RADMAN ransomware is most commonly distributed in programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how RADMAN ransomware infected your computer.",
      "NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware, refer to the .STOP entry."

However, you can attempt to decrypt your RADMAN files using Emsisoft Decryptor for STOP Djvu. Read the instructions at the program's website carefully before attempting to decrypt your RADMAN files."
