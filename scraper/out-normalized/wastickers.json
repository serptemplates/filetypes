Each sticker is a 512 x 512 pixel WEBP image with a transparent background. Each sticker pack also includes a sticker tray icon, which is a 96 x 96 pixel PNG image."

For example, you can decompress the file using Corel WinZip for Android, 7-Zip (Windows) or Apple Archive Utility (Mac). Before decompressing your WASTICKERS file, you may have to rename it to use the .zip extension."
