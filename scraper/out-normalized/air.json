      "AIR files are similar to the more common .EXE and .DMG files, which are used to install applications. However, AIR files can be used to install applications on multiple platforms, whereas EXE files and DMG files are restricted to Windows and macOS.",
      "If you receive an AIR file you will need to install Adobe AIR on your computer in order to open the file. After you install the program, simply double-click the AIR file and the application will be installed on your computer. It is important to note that Windows Vista systems may not correctly register the \".air\" file extension due to a locked file-type association in the registry.",
      "NOTE: AIR stands for \"Adobe Integrated Runtime\" and is a multi-platform environment for running Internet-based applications on the desktop."
