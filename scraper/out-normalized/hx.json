      "Haxe is an open-source, general-purpose programming language used to create video games, web applications, mobile applications, and cross-platform desktop applications. Notably, Haxe is used in the HaxeFlixel game engine, which is an open-source game engine used to develop 2D games.",
      "Haxe source code is saved in HX files. These files contain classes and functions used to run Haxe applications. When a developer compiles a Haxe application, the compiler transforms the application's HX files into a functional program.",
      "Complex Haxe programs may require multiple HX files to run. These files are organized in directories and sub-directories, which are often referred to in other HX files. In these cases, HX files may be referred to as modules, since they contain only part of a program's code."

      "You can open and edit HX files in any source code editor. The Haxe Foundation recommends opening HX files in Microsoft Visual Studio Code (cross-platform), Sublime Text (cross-platform), Jetbrains IntelliJ IDEA (cross-platform), or GitHub Atom (cross-platform). After you have installed Haxe and its related extensions, these programs will highlight Haxe syntax correctly, making it easier to edit Haxe source code."
