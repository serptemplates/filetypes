      "Musicians and producers in the late 1990s and 2000s who used Akai samplers were the primary users who encountered AKP files. They would load custom or pre-recorded sounds saved in the AKP format into Akai hardware samplers for music production or live performances, often for electronic music, hip-hop, and film scoring. While more modern equipment has surpassed Akai samplers that use the AKP format, musicians may still use old AKP files when producing music with computer software."
