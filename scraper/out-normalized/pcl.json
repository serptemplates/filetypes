      "HP introduced PCL 6 in 1996 that was the next evolution of the PCL language and related technologies. It has following there components:\n\nPCL 6 Enhanced: provides optimized version for printing from graphical user interfaces (GUIs) like MS Windows and OS/2\n\nPCL 6 Standard: provides complete backward compatibility with past HP LaserJet printers\n\nPCL Font Synthesis: provides scalable fonts, font management and storage of forms and fonts.\n\nThe extended version PCL XL is closer to GDI that many applications use. It makes sure that less translations take place that results in increased WYSIWYG capabilities and better performance with applications that support escapes implemented by the Enhanced driver. The output from the Enhanced (PCL XL) driver may not be the same as the output from the Standard driver. If the output is not as expected, choose the Standard (PCL5e) driver instead.\n\nPCL 6 Enhanced commands are designed to optimally match the graphics printing requirements for GUI-based applications. In most cases, for every graphics print command that a GUI wishes to perform, there is a matching PCL 6 Enhanced command. This reduces the number of commands required to describe a graphics page. Each command in PCL 6 Enhanced is designed to require minimal data transfer from the host PC to the printer. This reduces the amount of data required to describe a page.\n\nThe Windows Printing System for most HP LaserJet printers provides two separate drivers: Standard and Enhanced. The Standard driver provides backward compatibility by using PCL 6 Standard (PCL5e) commands to print simple text or mixed text and graphics pages. The Enhanced driver utilizes the PCL 6 Enhanced commands that have been optimized for printing complex graphics pages."
