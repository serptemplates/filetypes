      "Spark AR Studio allows Facebook users to create AR effects that they can apply to Facebook and Instagram videos. For example, a Spark AR Studio user could create a \"money money money\" effect that adds a deluge of virtual dollar bills to their videos.",
      "After a user has finished creating their effect, they can publish it by clicking AR Studio's Publish icon. This produces an AREXPORT file. The AREXPORT file contains up to three ARFX files, each of which gives a user access to the effect they created on a different set of mobile devices. One ARFX file gives users access to the effect on iOS devices, one gives users access to the effect on newer Android devices, and one gives users access to the effect on old Android devices.",
      "NOTE: Typically, each ARFX file must be 4 MB or smaller to be used on Instagram and 10 MB or smaller to be used on Facebook."
