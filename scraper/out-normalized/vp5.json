      "The VP5 format was developed by On2 Technologies in the early-2000s and released in 2002 to improve upon the VP4 codec. VP5 is roughly a 50% improvement over VP4, delivering better video quality at lower bitrates.",
      "The .vp5 file extension represents the video codec used to encode the video in the file. The .vp3 file extension also represents the VP3 codec used in .VP3 files.",
      "The VP5 format was primarily used in the early-2000s for streaming recorded video or live broadcasts over the web to computers, wireless devices, and gaming devices. The video format was most commonly utilized by the RealNetworks RealPlayer media player.",
