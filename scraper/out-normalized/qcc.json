      "Quilt Manager can be used to save patterns in the QCC, QMA, and .DXF formats but can also open QLI, .PNG, .BMP, and .IMG formats. The program allows users to preview simulations of stitching the pattern, view where the stitching arm jumps instead of stitches, and set colors to patterns. Quilt Manager is typically used by several popular robotic quilting systems, such as Quilt Magician, Butler, and Shirley Stitcher.",
      "QCC files are meant to be opened by Quilt Manager. However, they may also be opened by text editors, since they store the coordinates of each pattern stitch in plain text."
