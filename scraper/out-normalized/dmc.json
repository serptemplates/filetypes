      "Data sets internal to the DMC file are limited to 250,000 values per dataset. Therefore, they are suitable for small to moderate-size datasets and are often used for generating reference datasets for testing. Larger datasets can be referenced within the DMC file and are stored in separate local cache and index files for faster access and offline access.",
