      "Most computer users are familiar with the DOCX file, the primary file type created by Word and one of the most popular document types opened and saved by word processors. DOTX files are very similar to DOCX files but are used to store templates.",
      "The templates contain much of the same information DOCX files contain, including text, styles, and images. They may also be password-protected, which is helpful for securing content in templates that multiple people open and edit.",
      "DOTX files are convenient for users who need to make multiple Word documents with the same formatting and similar content, such as resumes, business plans, or newsletters.",
      "Word also comes with pre-loaded DOTX templates that allow you to create a document with many page layout elements, fonts, and styles in place. Then, depending on your need to customize the document, you can open the DOTX file and place your new text.",
      "NOTE: DOTX files replaced .DOT files when Microsoft released Office 2007. DOT files are saved in a binary format, while DOTX files are saved in the newer Open XML-based Word document format, which stores data as separate files and folders in a compressed Zip package."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open DOTX files with Microsoft Word in Windows and macOS. Word is the best choice for opening DOTX files because it fully supports the formatting of Word templates, which includes text spacing, tables, and images. The software is also available for Android and iOS devices.",
      "You can open DOTX templates with other applications, but they may not fully support the formatting of the original templates. Some examples include Apache OpenOffice Writer (multiplatform), Kingsoft Writer (multiplatform), and Apple Pages (Mac). If you are a Mac user looking to view a DOTX file, you can use Apple Preview, which comes bundled with macOS.",
      "You can also upload DOTX files to Google Docs, a free web and mobile application allowing you to view, edit, save, and convert the document."
