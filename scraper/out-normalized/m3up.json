      "Many media players can use .M3U format playlists to load and play a set of media files. For example, you can create an M3U playlist that references several Bob Dylan songs saved on your computer and then load that playlist in VideoLAN VLC media player to play those songs in sequence.",
      "M3U playlists that use UTF-8 character encoding are commonly saved as M3U8 files, to denote that they use UTF-8 encoding. Less commonly, UTF-8 encoded M3U playlists are saved as M3UP (M3U playlist) files.",
      "NOTE: The M3U format can also be used to create playlists that reference video or audio files that are hosted online. Loading these playlists allows you to stream the referenced files from your media player."
