      "Opening a .jpg_large file is quite simple since it’s essentially a standard JPEG image with a slightly modified file extension. Here’s how you can open it:\n\nRename the file: Change the file extension from .jpg_large to .jpg by renaming the file. Right-click the file, select “Rename,” and remove the _large part, so it ends with .jpg. The operating system will then treat it as a regular JPEG image.Open with an image viewer: Once renamed, you can open the file using any standard image viewer, such as:Windows Photo Viewer or Photos (Windows)Preview (macOS)Any other image editing software like Paint, GIMP, or Photoshop.",
      "Some image viewers and web browsers, such as Adobe Photoshop and Google Chrome, can open files with a .jpg_large extension. If an image viewer does not recognize a JPG_LARGE file, first change the file extension from .jpg_large to .jpg, then open the file."
