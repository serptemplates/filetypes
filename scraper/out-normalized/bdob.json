      "BDOB files are a variant of .BDO (Binding Data Object) files. Just like BDO files, BDOB files are used to associate (or bind) metadata with data objects, making it easier for NATO members to manage and retrieve information.",
      "Unlike BDO files, however, the data that BDOB files contain is not saved in a plain text format. Instead, it is saved in the .CBOR format, which is a binary-based variant of JSON."
