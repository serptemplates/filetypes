      "VM VirtualBox is a virtualization app that allows users to create and run virtual machines. For example, a Linux user might use VM VirtualBox to run a Windows virtual machine within Linux.",

      "For this reason, VM VirtualBox maintains a backup copy of your most-recent application settings in a file named VirtualBox.xml-prev. This file is stored alongside VirtualBox.xml, in the VirtualBox directory.",
      "If your copy of VirtualBox.xml goes missing or becomes corrupted, you can replace the file with your copy of VirtualBox.xml-prev, to attempt to restore your VM VirtualBox settings. To do so:",
