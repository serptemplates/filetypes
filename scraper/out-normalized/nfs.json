      "Netflix is a streaming service that provides a wide variety of movies and shows, including TV shows that are no longer airing and new Netflix original content. Most titles on Netflix are available for download although some are excluded. If a title can be downloaded it has a download icon next to the name. You can search for downloadable titles by selecting \"Available for Download\" from the Netflix menu. Tap the download icon to begin the download then navigate to the \"My Downloads\" section of the app to access the downloaded movie or show.",
      "When you choose a movie or TV to download to your device, the Netflix app downloads and saves the NFS file to your device in a folder along with several other files, including the .MANIFEST, .NFV, .NFI, and .NFA files. You most likely will never see the NFS file since the subtitles will automatically be played with the video directly in the Netflix app.",
      "If you want to delete a movie or show you downloaded to your Android device tap the menu icon in the app, select \"My Downloads\", tap the pencil edit icon in the upper right corner, and tap the red \"X\" icon to delete the title.",
      "If you want to delete a movie or show you downloaded to your iOS device tap the menu icon in the app, select \"My Downloads\", tap \"Edit\", and select the red \"X\" icon to delete the title.",
      "NOTE: In order to download Netflix content on your Android or iOS app you need to have Android 4.4.2 or later or iOS 8.0 or later. You will also need the latest version of the Netflix app."
