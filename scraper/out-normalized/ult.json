      "Ultra Tracker was popular among users of the Gravis UltraSound soundcard, which offered high-quality sample-based audio playback. Musicians used Ultra Tracker to compose multi-channel music optimized for this hardware. Over time, other music trackers, such as MikMod, added support for the ULT format, allowing users to continue playing it despite the eventual discontinuation of the original software.",
      "Later versions of Ultra Tracker introduced the .UNI format, which provided enhanced composition features and replaced ULT as the software’s primary module format. While different versions of Ultra Tracker may save ULT files with slight variations, most modern module players that support the ULT format can play all versions."
