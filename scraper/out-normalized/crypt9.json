      "The \"crypt9\" extension is one of many \"crypt\" extensions such as \"crypt6\", \"crypt7\", and \"crypt8\". The extension is often appended to a .DB file to create the db.crypt9 file, which is used by WhatsApp to secure a user's message database on his or her Android device. For each new installment, the application uses a different algorithm to encrypt the DB files. The extension appended to the DB file, such as .CRYPT7 or .CRYPT8, signifies the algorithm.",
