      "Adobe JRun is a Java Platform Enterprise Edition application server, which developers and IT professionals can use to run Java servlets. These servlets are used to generate dynamic webpages, using Java functions stored in one or more JSP files.",
      "Each JRun servlet may contain a JSA file, which is used to determine what happens when JRun begins serving an application, when a user session starts, when a user session ends, and when JRun stops serving the application. For example, the JSA file's onApplicationStart() method determines what happens when the associated application starts for the first time.",
      "NOTE: Java servlets created using Resin Server and Oracle software may also use JSA files. Java servlets developed in other applications do not use JSA files."
