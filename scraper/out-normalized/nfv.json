      "Netflix is a streaming service that provides a wide variety of movies and shows, including TV shows that are currently and no longer airing and new Netflix original content. The service initially began as a video rental service with Netflix mailing DVDs and Blu-ray discs to subscribers' homes. Netflix then morphed into a web streaming service, which is now available on Android and iOS devices.",
      "Most titles on Netflix are available for download, although Netflix excludes select content. If a movie or show can be downloaded, it has a download icon next to the name. You can search for downloadable titles by selecting \"Available for Download\" from the Netflix menu. Tap the download icon to begin the download then navigate to the \"My Downloads\" section of the app to access the downloaded movie or show.",
      "When Netflix downloads a movie or TV show to your device, the NFV file is saved to your device in a folder along with several other files, including the .MANIFEST, .NFS, .NFI, and .NFA files. You most likely will never see the NFV file since you can play the movie or show directly in the Netflix app.",
      "You can select the quality of your video download to fit your storage needs and desired level of video quality. High-quality video will take longer to download and more space on your device, whereas standard quality takes less time to download and less space on your device. An hour of standard quality content is approximately 280 MB, and high-quality content is approximately 440 MB. To select your download video quality, tap the menu icon in the Netflix app then select \"App Settings.\" Under the \"Downloads\" heading, select \"Video Quality\" and choose between \"Standard\" and \"Higher\" video quality.",
      "If you want to delete a movie or show you downloaded to your Android device, tap the menu icon in the app, select \"My Downloads,\" tap the pencil edit icon in the upper right corner and tap the red \"X\" icon to delete the title.",
      "If you want to delete a movie or show you downloaded to your iOS device tap the menu icon in the app, select \"My Downloads,\" tap \"Edit,\" and select the red \"X\" icon to delete the title.",
      "NOTE: To download Netflix videos on your Android or iOS app you need to have Android 4.4.2 or later or iOS 8.0 or later. You will also need the latest version of the Netflix app."
