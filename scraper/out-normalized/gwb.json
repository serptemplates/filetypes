      "In Interwrite Workspace, you can create pages with the \"Page Creation\" and \"Capture\" tools then can annotate them with the \"Annotation\" tools. The GWB file is automatically created as an untitled presentation when you go into \"Annotation\" mode and is automatically saved whenever any changes are made to the presentation. GWB files can be used for printing a presentation or emailing a presentation to other InterWrite users.",
      "Interwrite Workspace is a software package that connects with Interwrite Board (an electronic whiteboard) and is used to write and record digital lessons, use virtual simulations, and access other digital content. Interwrite Learning products were absorbed into electronic whiteboard technology developed by Turning Technologies."
