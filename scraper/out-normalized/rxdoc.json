      "Audio post-production specialists use iZotope RX Audio Editor to clean up audio files that will be used in movies, TV shows, and other productions. For example, a production engineer might use iZotope RX to remove a background hum from a TV show's dialogue track.",
      "Projects created in iZotope RX are saved as RXDOC files. Saving a project as an RXDOC file preserves the original audio file that was imported into the project, as well as a record of all the edits a user made to that file. That way, the user can retrieve the original file or undo their edits as needed. After a user has finished editing their audio file to their satisfaction, they can export the cleaned-up audio using iZotope RX's export tools."
