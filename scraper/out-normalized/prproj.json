      "Adobe Premiere Pro is a professional video editing application for creating feature films, broadcasts, and other video presentations. When saving a project in Premiere Pro, the application creates a PRPROJ file to store the contents.",
      "PRPROJ files store references to media assets (video, audio, graphics); they do not store the actual media data in the file itself. The references to these media assets are created when you import the asset into your project. Therefore, if you move the asset after importing it, Premiere Pro will not be able to locate the asset for the project, which will prompt you to relocate the asset.",
      "To create a PRPROJ file, select File → New → Project..., modify your project, then select File → Save or Save As.... Once you save the PRPROJ file, you can close it, re-open it, then continue editing the project."
