      "The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) created the TTML format to serve as a uniform standard for XML-based subtitles. Each TTML file contains a fixed set of header and body elements used to play subtitles and specify metadata about those subtitles. For example, each TTML file includes a <styling> element that specifies its subtitles' text style and a <language> element that specifics its subtitles' language.",
      "The actual subtitles a TTML file contains are found in its <body> section. Each line of the file's subtitles is written as a separate paragraph (<p></p>), with an accompanying start and end time written in HH:MM:SS:SSS format.",
      "Because TTML is a widely-accepted format, many video players, platforms, and streaming services include support for TTML-based subtitles. For example, YouTube users can upload TTML subtitles alongside their videos."
