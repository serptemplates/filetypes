      "KiCad uses KICAD_PCB files as the main working file for the PCB layout stage of a project. Users typically create these files after designing a schematic in KiCad's schematic editor and generating a netlist. Designers then open the KICAD_PCB file in the PCB Editor to place components, route connections, and verify the design using KiCad's built-in design rule checks. Once finalized, users can export the file to standard manufacturing formats, such as Gerber and drill files, for fabrication.",
      "KiCad introduced the KICAD_PCB format in version 4.0, replacing the older .BRD format used in previous versions of the software. KICAD_PCB files are saved in a human-readable, text-based format that uses S-expressions, which makes it easier for version control systems to track changes and for users to edit the file manually if necessary."
