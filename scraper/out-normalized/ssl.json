      "SSL files are located in the \"scripts\" folder of your game directory. An SSL file must be compiled into an .INT file in order for the game to use it. You can use the Fallout Script Editor to compile SSL files. After compiling the script, the INT file will bear the same name as the SSL that it is compiled from (e.g., example.ssl becomes example.int).",
      "NOTE: SSL is also an acronym for Secure Sockets Layer. However, SSL files used by Fallout 1 and 2 are for game scripts and not for Secure Sockets Layers."
