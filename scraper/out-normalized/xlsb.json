      "XLSB files differ from standard Open XML format (.XLSX) spreadsheets since they store the spreadsheet using a binary format (BIFF12). You will most likely see and use the XLSX file more often because it is compressed to save space and is easier to share with other users. XLSB files are not compressed, making them larger than XLSX files. However, XLSB files may perform more efficiently within Excel because they are saved in the larger binary format.",
