      "Pixelmator is a Mac- and iOS-only image editor that allows you to enhance or touch up photos, digitally draw and paint, and add text, shapes, and effects to images. When you save images you have created or edited with Pixelmator, the app saves them as PXM files.",
      "PXM images consist of one or more layers, which contain image elements. For example, a PXM file might include a background image layer, a shape layer, and a text layer. You can edit each of these layers individually and continue to edit the layers after closing and re-opening the file."
