      "CANNEDSEARCH folders are referenced by Finder for searching the contents of a computer, which includes applications, folders, and files. These folders are appended with the \".cannedSearch\" extension, even though they are folders. OS X comes loaded with canned searches, most commonly the \"All My Files\" search in Finder. Therefore, most users will never see the CANNEDSEARCH folder. However, if you would like to add and/or modify search queries in Finder you will most likely come across the CANNEDSEARCH folder.",
