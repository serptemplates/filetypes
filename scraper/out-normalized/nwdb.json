      "You most likely will only see the NWDB file if you search the Neat Data folder in your Documents folder. There should be at least three files in the Neat Data folder: a Neatworks NWDB file, an image NWDB file, and a cabinet NWCAB file.",
      "If you come across an error message indicating that you cannot open a Neat database, it most likely means that a file in your database is corrupt, locked by another program, or missing. You should check that all three files are in the Neat Data folder. If one of the three files is missing then it causes the error message.",
      "NOTE: An NWDB file is actually a SQL Server Compact Edition (SQLCE) database but instead of the .sdf file extension, it has the .nwdb file extension. Therefore, any programs that can open .SDF SQL Server Compact Database files can also open NWDB files."

      "To open an .nwdb file created by Neat 5, you need to use the Neat software directly. Here’s how you can do that:\n\nInstall Neat software\n\nMake sure that you have Neat 5 installed on your computer. If you don’t have it, you can download it from the Neat website.\n\nLocate Neat Data folder\n\nThe .nwdb files are generally stored in Neat Data folder situated within your Documents folder. The path may resemble something like this:\n\nC:\\Users\\<YourUsername>\\Documents\\Neat Data\n\nLaunch Neat 5\n\nOpen the Neat 5 application on your computer.\n\nImport NWDB file\n\nIf the application doesn’t automatically identify and open .nwdb file\n\nLook for option to import files. This might be under File menu or an import button.Navigate to the Neat Data folder and choose .nwdb file you want to open.\n\nCheck for Associated Files\n\nMake sure that all associated files are present in Neat Data folder. An NWDB file often depends on other files (like image files and cabinet files) to work properly. If any of these are missing, it might cause errors when trying to open the database.\n\nOpen the Application\n\nOnce you import the file, you should be able to access and manage your scanned documents and metadata within the Neat interface."
