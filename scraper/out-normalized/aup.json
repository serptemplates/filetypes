      "AUP files are saved with a corresponding folder named myproject_data, where myproject.aup is the project filename. This folder saves small chunks of audio data in an optimized, proprietary format that can be opened only by Audacity (these files use the .AU extension). When finished with sound editing, you can export an audio project to many different formats, including .WAV, .AIFF, .MP3, .M4A, and .WMA.",
      "NOTE: With the release of Audacity 3.0, .AUP3 files replaced AUP files. You can open AUP files in Audacity 3.0 and later versions, but when you save your project, Audacity 3.0 will save the project as an AUP3 file."
