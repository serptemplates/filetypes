      "Pando is a discontinued file sharing program that was available for Windows and Mac PCs. It allowed users to upload and download files using the BitTorrent file sharing protocol.",
      "When a Pando user begins downloading a file, the application creates a corresponding DOWNLOADING file. This placeholder file is used to store the download's contents until it completes. At that point, Pando assigns the file its actual extension, to signal the file is ready for use.",
      "NOTE: DOWNLOADING files are similar to the .CRDOWNLOAD, .DOWNLOAD, and .!BT files produced by other download managers."

      "Typically, DOWNLOADING files are not meant to be opened. If you possess a DOWNLOADING file, you should resume the associated download in Pando. After the download finishes, Pando will assign the file its correct extension, and you can open it normally.",
      "If your Pando download was interrupted and you cannot resume it, you may still be able to view your DOWNLOADING file's contents. To do so, replace the .downloading extension with the extension your file is supposed to have. For example, if you were downloading an MP4 file, change your DOWNLOADING file's extension to .mp4. You can then attempt to open the partially-downloaded version of your file."
