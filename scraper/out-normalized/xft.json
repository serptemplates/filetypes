      "ChiWriter supported both screen fonts and printer fonts. While screen fonts displayed the document on screen, XFT files ensured that the printed output matched the appearance of the on-screen content as closely as possible.",
      "Each XFT file typically contained a specific font style or symbol set and was designed to work with a certain printer resolution and dot arrangement, especially for high-resolution 24-pin matrix printers. Although ChiWriter was discontinued in 1996, researchers, engineers, and academics who used it to create technical documents might still encounter XFT files when accessing old ChiWriter documents."
