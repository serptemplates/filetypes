      "Starting with Windows 3.1, Windows included an online help program named Windows Help (winhelp.exe or winhlp32.exe). Windows XP was the last version of Windows to include the program by default. The program was available for download and use with Windows Vista, 7, 8, and 8.1, but officially discontinued as of Windows 10 and Windows Server 2012.",
      "Windows Help used HLP files to show help documentation to users. The HLP files include not only documentation, but also indexes allowing users to navigate documentation more easily. Developers compiled HLP files using Microsoft Help Workshop (HCW.exe).",
