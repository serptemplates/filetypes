      "StarUML uses the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to visualize the design of software. When you create a new project or load a saved project, you are using the model file. As a precaution, StarUML makes a backup of your working model file every 5 minutes and if the application quits unexpectedly, the backup will be restored when you restart. Model files can also be exported as a .PNG, .JPG, or .SVG file."
