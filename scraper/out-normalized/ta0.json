      "TaxAct is a tax preparation program used to prepare and file U.S. Federal and State tax returns. It is available as a downloadable desktop version (only for Windows) and as an online application.",
      "The desktop version of TaxAct creates TA0 files when you save your progress as you fill out a 1040 annual income tax return. You can then close and reopen the TA0 file to continue working on it.",
      "TaxAct saves TA0 files in the My Documents\\​TaxAct2020 folder by default. Once you have completed a tax return, you can either print and mail in the tax forms or file electronically.",
      "Since annual tax returns are filed for the previous year, the TA0 file is typically created in 2021 from January to April. The TA0 file replaced the .TA9 file, which is used for 2019 tax returns created by the 2020 version of TaxAct.",
      "You can create a backup of your tax return in case your tax return file becomes corrupt, is deleted, or gets lost. To do this, select File → Backup... and name your file. A backup tax return is created and saved as a .BA0 file. It is important to note that you must save your tax return before creating your backup."

For example, you can upload a TA9 file to TaxAct Online when filing your taxes for the 2020 calendar year. Or if you are filing your 2021 taxes with TaxAct Online, you can then upload your TA0 file. To open a TaxAxt Desktop return file from a previous year with TaxAct Online, click Basic Info → Data Import, click \"import your [YYYY] Desktop return,\" then follow the prompts to upload the file."
