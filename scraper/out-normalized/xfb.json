      "Be sure to backup any data on your Xserve RAID and unmount any Xserve RAID volumes from the host systems to prevent any loss of data before applying the firmware updates. Do not quit RAID Admin at any point during the firmware updating process. At the end of the update to your Xserve RAID system, the process will automatically begin a restart of Xserve RAID.",
      "To open the XFB file (update the firmware), select System → Update Firmware and select your XFB file you want to use for the update.",
