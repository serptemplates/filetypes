      "McNeel Rhino is a 3D modeling program that allows users to create, edit, animate, and export 3D models. Grasshopper is a visual programming environment included with Rhino. It allows users to create programs that automatically generate lines, shapes, complex geometry, and even entire 3D models in Rhino.",
      "To create a Grasshopper program, users open Grasshopper alongside Rhino and then drag and drop visual code elements (which appear as rounded rectangles) on Grasshopper's programming canvas. They then link code elements to objects within a 3DM file. Users can add additional code elements, connect them, and edit them as needed, until they are satisfied with the model their program produces.",
      "After creating a Grasshopper program, users save that program as a GH or GHX file. These files are most commonly referred to as Grasshopper definitions. The only major difference between GH and GHX files is that GH files are binary files while GHX files are XML files. Grasshopper can open GH and GHX files."

After Grasshopper opens, select File → Open and open your GH file. Then, you can edit the program your file contains and link it to the geometry in a 3DM file."
