      "Secret Calculator Folder is an app that looks like a calculator app, but actually allows users to hide photos from others who might access their device. Secret Calculator Folder can also hide other types of files (including videos and notes), a user's passwords, and a user's bookmarks. To access these hidden files and information, users enter a password on the app's calculator screen.",
      "Optionally, users can create a backup of the files and other data they've stored in Secret Calculator Folder. This backup is saved as an SCBACKUP file. To open SCBACKUP files, and retrieve their contents, users use the app's associated online backup opener."
