      "Gamers and preservationists may use GDI files to play or archive Dreamcast titles. When a Dreamcast emulator loads a GDI file, it reads the file's track list and then loads the corresponding BIN and RAW files to run the game. This format is generally preferred for emulation because it preserves the disc's original layout and data structure.",
