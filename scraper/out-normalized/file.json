      "Because FILE files do not use a recognized extension, most programs cannot open them by default. If you know what type of file your FILE file contains, you can rename the file to use that extension. For example, if you know your FILE file contains a Microsoft Word document, you can rename it to use the .DOCX extension. You'll then be able to open the file in Microsoft Word.",
      "If you don't know what type of file your FILE file contains, you can attempt to identify its contents with a file identification utility. You should not double-click or right-click and open unknown files before verifying their contents, as they may contain malware designed to attack your computer.",
