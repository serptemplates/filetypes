      "Panwrypter secures your files by restructuring (depleting) the data in the files, and storing parts of the data in multiple storage volume files (WRYPT files) in different places. The files may be stored on an online file storage service or physical site. The data in a secured file can only be accessed by re-assembling the storage volume files (WRYPT files) from each location using Panwrypter. This security method makes the files difficult to hack.",
      "NOTE: The data in a WRYPT file is non-linear, non-sequential data that can only be restored using Panwrypter."
