      "StarCraft II assets files can contain various types of game data, including audio, video, models, textures, and other data. Commonly bundled audio files include .OGG and .WAV files. Textures are commonly in a .DDS format, and videos are often included as .OGV files. Other files include .FXA actor animations and .M3 model files.",
      "SC2ASSETS files can be found in the StarCraft II installation in the \\​StarCraft II\\​Campaigns\\​Liberty.SC2Campaign\\​ and \\​StarCraft II\\​Mods\\​Liberty.SC2Mod\\​ directories, as well as others.",
      "StarCraft II assets files are typically very large in size since they contain audio, video, and graphics data. For example, the file base.SC2Assets in the \\​StarCraft II\\​Campaigns\\​Liberty.SC2Campaign\\​ directory is 3.72GB in size.",
      "NOTE: Since SC2ASSETS files are created in an MPQ format, you can rename their extension to \".mpq\" and open them with an MPQ editor."
