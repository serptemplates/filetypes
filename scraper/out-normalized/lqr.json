      "In the early 1980s, developer Gary P. Novosielski created the LU archiving utility. Developers use this utility to package CP/M and DOS software programs in LBR files, which can be distributed to end users. Notably, however, LBR files are not compressed.",
      "To share LBR files more efficiently, developers often compress the files using a separate compression utility. LBR files compressed using SQ or another Squeeze compression utility are typically renamed to use the .lqr extension, to denote that they are Squeeze-compressed.",
      "NOTE: LBR files compressed with Crunch use the .LZR extension."
