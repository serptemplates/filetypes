      "The internal file structure of a .oam file is proprietary and not publicly documented by Adobe. However, it is known that .oam files contain a collection of files and resources (such as graphics, audio, and ActionScript code) packaged into a single file. The contents of a .oam file may include XML files, SWF files, and other resource files. The exact structure of the .oam file depends on the specific version of Adobe Animate used to create it, as well as the type of animation and assets included in the file.\n\nAn OAM file contains the following information.\n\nAssets: Information about the graphics, audio, and video assets used in the animation.\n\nBehaviors: Descriptions of the actions and interactions that occur in the animation.\n\nActionScript code: The code used to control the animation’s behavior and interactivity.\n\nPublish settings: Information about the platform and format in which the animation will be published, such as HTML5 or AIR.\n\nMetadata: Additional information such as the animation’s author, creation date, and version number.",
      "Each OAM file contains shapes, images, and other content, as well as a timeline for playing the animation the file contains. Users can create OAM files by publishing from an Edge Animate project (.AN file). Users can also export OAM files from Adobe Animate, Adobe Flash, and other animation applications.",

      "Select File → Publish Settings....",
      "Check the box next to Animate Deployment Package and choose your output options and location.",
      "Select File → Publish and then navigate to the folder you chose in the Publish Settings dialog to retrieve your OAM file.",
