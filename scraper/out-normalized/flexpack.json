      "FL Studio is a popular digital audio workstation (DAW) available for Windows and macOS. You can extend FL Studio's functionality using a variety of free and paid plug-ins. FLEX is a free plug-in included with FL Studio 20.5 and later versions.",
      "Using FLEX, you can add effects to FL Studio audio. To start, you select a FLEX preset that determines what default effect is applied to the audio. Typically, these presets emulate musical instruments, such as a piano or bass drum. Some presets, however, apply unique synthesized sounds that do not correspond to an instrument.",
      "To install additional FLEX presets, you can download preset packs saved as FLEXPACK files. Typically, FLEX users download FLEXPACK files in FLEX, and the plug-in automatically installs the files. However, users can purchase FLEX preset packs from Image-Line's online store. After doing so, the user must download the associated FLEXPACK file(s) from their Image-Line account and install the file(s) themselves."
