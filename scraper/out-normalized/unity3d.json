      "Unity Web Player was a plug-in available for web browsers. It allowed gamers to load and play 3D games saved as UNITY3D files in their web browser.",
      "In 2015, Google and other web browser providers removed support for Netscape Plug-in Application Programming Interface (NPAPI) plug-ins. Because Unity Web Player is an NPAPI plug-in, Unity chose to deprecate Unity Web Player. Therefore, Unity Web Player is no longer available for download, and you may have trouble playing the game your UNITY3D file contains.",

If you do not have access to Unity Web Player and a web browser that supports NPAPI plug-ins, you will not be able to open your UNITY3D file."
