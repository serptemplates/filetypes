      "MASSEFFECTSAVE files may be saved automatically or manually. Auto-saves use the file naming convention profileXX_AutoSave.MassEffectSave, where \"profile\" is the name of the player profile, and \"XX\" is the number of the save. Similarly, quick saves typically use the convention profileXX_QuickSave.MassEffectSave.",
      "To manually view the contents of a MASSEFFECTSAVE file, rename the file extension to \".zip\" and decompress it with a decompression tool, such as 7zip. The two resulting decompressed files, player.sav and state.sav, can be used to modify (\"mod\") saved game content.",
