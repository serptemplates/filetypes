      "Once the burn folder has been created, you can drag files and folders to it. The total size of the folder will appear at the bottom of the window. When you are ready to burn the contents of the folder to a disc, insert a CD or DVD and click the Burn button near the upper-right corner of the window.",
      "NOTE: Apple computers no longer include a DVD disc drive. Therefore, FPBF files are less commonly used than with previous computer models that included a disc drive."
