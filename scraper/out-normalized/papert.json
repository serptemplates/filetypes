      "Dropbox introduced Paper 2017 as a free tool for Dropbox users to collaborate with others in an online workspace where they can create, review, revise, organize, and present ideas. While PAPERT templates store contents in the same format as PAPER documents, Paper users create and share the templates to preserve the formatting and content of a document they wish to replicate. Users can create a PAPERT template from a PAPER document by opening the document, clicking the … (ellipses) icon, and selecting Templatize.",
      "Like PAPER files, Paper only uses PAPERT files internally, meaning you cannot download PAPERT files from the online workspace. However, you can share a link to download a .URL shortcut to the PAPERT file, which you can double-click to open in the Paper workspace. The file will appear with an underscore preceding the template name followed by the .papert.url extension (e.g., _template.papert.url)."

      "All PAPER documents are accessible from the Paper Home screen, and you can click them to open them. You may also find them in your Dropbox folder if you have the Dropbox desktop app installed, but when you double-click the PAPERT files, they will open in the Paper workspace in your web browser."
