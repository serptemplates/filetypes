      "Microsoft Office themes consist of color, font, and effect settings that a user can quickly apply to a document. For example, a business might create a custom Office theme that consists of their brand's colors and fonts. The business could then use that theme to apply their colors and fonts to documents they create.",
      "Prior to Office 2007, users could create themes in each Office application, but they could not apply those themes across applications. To make theming related documents, presentations, and spreadsheets easier, Microsoft created the cross-application THMX format and released it with Office 2007.",
