      "Workstation and Fusion are applications that allow you to run multiple operating systems, including Windows and Linux, as virtual machines (VMs) on a Mac. In addition, VMware introduced the Teams feature when it released Workstation 5 to allow you to manage multiple VMs in different environments better.",
      "When creating a team of VMs, the software creates a VMTM file to store configuration information for the team. You can modify and save a configuration as a VMTM file and load team configurations in a VMTM file through the VMware user interface.",
