      "Archicad is a building information modeling (BIM) application for designing and visualizing structures, interiors, exteriors, and landscapes. When working on a project, your system may suddenly crash, causing you to lose your work. However, Archicad provides an auto-save capability that backs up your work for you automatically.",
      "To enable this capability, select Options → Work Environment > Data Safety & Integrity and check the \"Make Backup Copy\" checkbox. After choosing this option, Archicad will create BPN files at regular intervals based on user-specified application preferences.",
      "The backup is saved to the same directory as the PLN project file. Additionally, if the project file becomes corrupted, you can rename the .bpn extension to .pln and use the backup as your main project file."
