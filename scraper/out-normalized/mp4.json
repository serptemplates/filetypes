      "MP4 is an extensible container file, meaning that it does not define a strict structure and allows custom structure and hierarchy for each media type. The data in the MP4 file is divided into two sections, the first containing the media-related data and the second containing metadata. The media data contains audio or video and metadata indicate flags for random access, timestamps, etc. The structures in MP4 are typically referred to as atoms or boxes. The minimum size of an atom is 8 bytes(the first 4 bytes specify size and the next 4 bytes specify type). Here is a list of the root level atoms contained in MP files:\n\nftyp: Contains the file type, description, and the common data structures used.pdin: Contains progressive video loading/downloading information.moov: Container for all the movie metadata.moof: Container with video fragments.mfra: The container with random access to the video fragmentmdat: Data container for media.stts: sample-to-time table.stsc: sample-to-chunk table.stsz: sample sizes (framing)meta: The container with the metadata information.\n\nHere is a list of second-level atoms used in MP4:\n\nmvhd: Contains the video header information with full details of the video.trak: Container with the individual track.udta: The container with the user and track information.iods: MP4 file descriptor",
      "In the late 1990s, the ISO and IEC organizations commissioned the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) to develop an international standard for audio and video coding formats. This initiative resulted in the formation of the MP4 format, which MPEG released in 2001 and subsequently updated in 2003 with version 2 of the format.",
      "Since its release, MP4 has become one of the most common formats for storing and sharing video. The format's popularity is partially due to its ability to save videos at smaller file sizes than most other formats without much loss in quality. This advantage made MP4 an excellent option for exporting videos and sharing them online.",
      "The MP4 format is an extension of the QuickTime File Format (QTFF), used in .MOV and .QT video files. It is a container format that supports different data streams, including video, audio, subtitles, and metadata, with each stream encoded by different codecs, as detailed below:",
      "Video data - May be encoded using various codecs, such as MPEG-4 Part 10 (H.264/AVC), MPEG-H Part 2 (H.265/HEVC), or MPEG-4 Part 2",
      "Audio data - Primarily compressed with AAC compression, which is the same audio compression used by .AAC files ​",
      "Subtitle data - Typically saved in the MPEG-4 Streaming text format, which is also known as MPEG-4 Part 17 and MPEG-4 Timed Text (MP4TT)",
      "Metadata - May be formatted using various standards, including the Extensible Metadata Platform (XMP) format",
      "Furthermore, the MP4 container supports both lossless and lossy codecs. For example, MP4 supports the lossless MPEG-4 SLS and lossy AAC audio codecs.",
      "However, MP4 only supports lossy video codecs, which compress video data at varying levels. For example, the popular H.264 video codec featured in many MP4 files uses lossy compression to significantly reduce video data stream sizes, which is helpful when sharing MP4 files online (e.g., uploading videos to YouTube and Vimeo).",
      "NOTE: MP4 files that store only audio data typically use the .m4a extension (.M4A files)."
