      "The SYMYNELEC Light Bulb outdoor security camera, Annke Crater 1080p indoor security camera, and some other Wi-Fi security cameras save footage to EPV files. Users can view the footage these files contain from within the camera's associated smartphone app, which is usually available for download from the Google Play Store or Apple App Store.",
