      "In 1982, Spectrum Software released the original version of Micro-Cap. Micro-Cap is an application that electronics engineers use to model, simulate, and test electrical circuits. The most recent version of Micro-Cap, Micro-Cap 12, allows engineers to perform smoke and stress analyses, perform worst-case analyses, and adjust the temperature conditions a circuit is tested under, among other features.",
      "Micro-Cap 12 and earlier versions save engineers' circuit models as CIR files. These files are plain text files formatted such that Micro-Cap can read and transform them into circuit diagrams. The first section of a CIR file, which contains the header [Main], details the file's type, the version of Micro-Cap that created the file, and various other metadata. The remainder of the file contains data used to show a circuit in Micro-Cap."

      "If you want to view the plain text data a CIR file contains outside Micro-Cap, you can open the file in any text editor."
