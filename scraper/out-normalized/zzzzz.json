      "The Locky virus is highly dangerous malware. It is commonly referred to as ransomware, where the purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator (by way of bitcoin) to unlock your files. The virus is a trojan horse that is spread via spam emails that include infected attachments or malicious links. Once the virus affects your computer it begins scrambling your files, renaming them, and encrypting them. The virus then generates a .TXT ransom note informing you of the takeover and what you need to do to recover your files."
