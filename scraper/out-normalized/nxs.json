      "Nexus is a collection of tools used to convert large 3D models to the NXS format, edit NXS files, and view NXS files. Notably, converting a model to the NXS format allows users to view the model at different resolutions, optimized for their (GPU's|gpu) resources. This makes it easier for users to view large, graphics-intensive 3D models.",
      "The Nexus toolset is compatible with the OpenGL graphics API. This allows developers to include and show NXS models in programs that use the OpenGL API."

It also allows you to convert the file to the .PLY format. Nxsview allows you to view the model an NXS file contains."
