      "SteamVR is a virtual reality gaming system that allows users to don a headset and handheld controllers and play interactive video games. Whenever SteamVR installs a game, it creates a VRMANIFEST file for that game. The VRMANIFEST file tells SteamVR how to launch the game, as well as what image to show when a player views the game in a SteamVR menu.",
      "VRMANIFEST files are plain text files that contain JSON data. Each game's VRMANIFEST file contains the game's app_key, which SteamVR uses to identify the game, launch_type, which SteamVR uses to determine how it should load and launch the game, and name and image_path, which SteamVR uses to determine how the game appears in menus.",
      "Steamapps.vrmanifest contains data used to keep track of and load each of your SteamVR games, including a reference to those games' action manifest. Action manifests are saved in files named actions.json within a game's installation folder, and they determine how a game's controls are mapped to your controller. If SteamVR tells you it cannot find a game's action manifest, it means the path referenced in your steamapps.vrmanifest file is invalid. Closing SteamVR, deleting steamapps.vrmanifest and the game's VRMANIFEST file, and then reopening SteamVR should fix this issue."
