      "Squirrel is an object-oriented programming language similar to Lua, C++, and JavaScript. it is designed to be lightweight, fitting the memory, size, and real-time requirements of programs, mainly video games, such as Left 4 Dead 2, Simutrans, Shadow Warrior, SuperTux, and Portal 2.",
      "Since there is another file type with the \".nut\" extension, you can look at the file size for an indication of what type of NUT file you have. NUT files containing a Squirrel script rarely reach 1MB whereas NUT video files are larger than 1MB."
