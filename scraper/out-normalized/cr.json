      "Crystal is a general object-oriented programming language that is based on Ruby. Unlike Ruby, however, Crystal is a compiled language. This means the language's source code files must be compiled before the code they contain can be executed.",
      "Developers typically save Crystal source code in plain text files that use the .cr file extension. Saving Crystal source code files with the .cr extension allows source code editors that recognize the Crystal programming language to highlight the language's syntax correctly."

      "If you want to quickly compile and run the code a CR file contains, you can do so using the Online Playgrounds available on the language's GitHub page (linked below)."
