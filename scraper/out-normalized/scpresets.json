      "SCPRESETS files allow you to switch between different option sets depending on your conversion job. For example, one presets file may be used for batch converting thumbnails for your website, while another might be used for watermarking photos before sending them to a prospective client.",
      "Snap Converter presets files are saved using Apple's .PLIST file format, and they contain plain text properties for settings on the user interface. You can modify an SCPRESETS file manually, but be careful because changes in the embedded properties could cause unintended consequences."
