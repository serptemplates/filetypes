      "Pixen allows users to design and save custom patterns as PXPATTERN files, which they can then reuse in other projects. For example, a pixel artist may create a repeating cobblestone pattern in Pixen and save it as a PXPATTERN file to quickly fill large areas of a game map. The artist then reuses the pattern across multiple scenes to keep the design consistent and speed up their workflow.",
