      "The F32 format represents each audio sample using 32-bit floating point values, supporting a wide dynamic range that captures quiet and loud sounds with greater accuracy (e.g., no distortion or clipping). Since it's uncompressed and high precision, F32 files are typically very large in size, making them less suitable for casual listening or distribution but ideal for mastering, editing, and detailed sound design work where preserving the audio's full quality is essential. Users typically convert or export F32 files into more common formats like WAV or FLAC once they finish editing them."
