      "Among other features, TestComplete projects and project suites allow you to test different applications using the same settings. A PJS file is similar to a .MDS file but holds information for a suite of projects instead of a single project. A TCLS file is also similar to a PJS file but is used to store tester-related settings for a project suite.",
