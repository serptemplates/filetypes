      "DBX folders have names corresponding to their email mailbox. For example, common names are Inbox.dbx, Sent Items.dbx, Drafts.dbx, and Deleted Items.dbx. Folders.dbx stores the master index for all the mailboxes. If it is missing, Outlook Express will re-index the mailboxes and recreate it.",
      "DBX mail folders can be imported into Windows Mail (included with Windows Vista) by selecting File → Import → Messages, then choosing Import mail from an OE6 store directory and selecting the DBX folder you would like to import.",
      "DBX folders can be imported into Windows Live Mail (included with Windows 7) by selecting File → Import → Messages → Microsoft Outlook Express 6 and locating the appropriate DBX folder.",
      "The Stellar DBX to PST Converter program can be used to convert Outlook Express DBX files to the Outlook .PST format. You can then save converted files to Office 365, HTML, RTF, and PDF formats.",
      "NOTE: DBX folders should only be opened in Outlook Express or imported using another program. If opened or edited manually, they can become corrupted and cause Outlook Express not to function properly."
