      "WOFF file structure is similar to that of sfnt fonts. It is based on a table directory that contains the lengths and offsets to each font data tables. All the tables are followed after this initial information. The file contains font database that are the same as in the original fonts. The order of the tables are also the same but each may be compressed. WOFF table directory replaces the original table directory though.\n\nA WOFF file consists of following:\n\nWOFFHeader - File header with basic font type and version, along with offsets to metadata and private data blocks.TableDirectory - Directory of font tables, indicating the original size, compressed size and location of each table within the WOFF file.FontTables - The font data tables from the input sfnt font, compressed to reduce bandwidth requirements.ExtendedMetadata - An optional block of extended metadata, represented in XML format and compressed for storage in the WOFF file.PrivateData- An optional block of private data for the font designer, foundry, or vendor to use.",
      "WOFF files allow web developers to use custom fonts rather than the standard web fonts. Many browsers support the WOFF format, but most of them do not support WOFF files until recent versions. WOFF files are referenced within CSS files using the @font-face rule. WOFF files were replaced with .WOFF2 files, which are saved in the WOFF 2.0 format that features improved compression.",
      "NOTE: FontForge allows you to create OTF and TTF font files from the WOFF file."
