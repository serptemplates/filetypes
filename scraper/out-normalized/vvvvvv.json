      "In VVVVVV, players control Captain Viridian, navigating a retro-style environment where gravity can be flipped, allowing movement across floors and ceilings. In the game, players who want to add environments beyond the main storyline can create custom levels, save them as VVVVVV files, and share them with others.",
      "The VVVVVV format supports scripting, custom dialogue, and visual themes, offering a wide range of creative possibilities for level designers. These files typically reside in the user's VVVVVV directory and are loaded by the game when selected from the custom levels interface."
