      "In 1991, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) developed a standard audio format that could be used to save and distribute files meant to be used with speech recognition research software. This format was called NIST SPHERE, and files saved in this format were often saved with the .nist extension.",
      "Notably, NIST files all include a standard ASCII header that specifies numerous pieces of metadata, including the files' database type, database version, number of audio channels, number of audio samples, and sample rate.",
      "NOTE: NIST files are sometimes saved with the .SPH extension."
