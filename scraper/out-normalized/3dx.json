      "Robert McNeel & Associates develops Rhino, which is widely used by professionals in architecture, industrial design, engineering, jewelry design, and 3D animation. The 3DX format allows users to save, share, and edit 3D models within Rhino.",
      "Additionally, the format uses Non-Uniform Rational B-Splines (NURBS), a mathematical model that allows for precise curves and surfaces. Unlike polygon-based models, which approximate shapes using flat surfaces, NURBS enables the creation of highly detailed and complex surfaces using control points, weights, and mathematical equations, ensuring that curves and surfaces remain fluid and accurate, even when zoomed in or converted to other formats, such as .STL (for 3D printing) or .IGES (for CAD software interoperability).",
