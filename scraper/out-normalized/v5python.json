      "VEXcode V5 is an educational programming tool, similar to MIT Scratch, that provides an intuitive interface for developing robotics projects. For instance, users can create programs by dragging and connecting code blocks, enabling beginners to design robotic actions without requiring prior knowledge of programming languages.",
      "However, for more advanced users, VEXcode also supports text-based coding in Python and C++. For example, they can open the Code Viewer in VEXcode V5, choose the Python option, and then select Convert to Text Project. They can select File → Save As to save it as a V5PYTHON file. If a VEXcode V5 user chooses the C++ option, they can save their projects as .V5CPP files."

      "You can open V5PYTHON files with VEXcode V5. The app is available on various platforms, including Windows, macOS, Android, iOS, Chrome OS, and in a web browser. To open a V5PYTHON file, select File → Open from within VEXcode V5.",
      "Since V5PYTHON files contain plain text, you can also open them with any text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows), Apple TextEdit (macOS), and gedit (Linux). However, text editors do not provide the same editing capabilities as VEXcode V5."
