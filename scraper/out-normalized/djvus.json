      "STOP ransomware, also known as STOP Djvu ransomware, is a common family of ransomware that cybercriminals use to extort ransoms from PC users. The DJVUS variant of STOP ransomware first appeared in late 2018. It encrypts a user's files and then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. The note contains instructions users are meant to follow to decrypt their files.",
      "STOP Djvus ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by STOP Djvus ransomware."
