      "The GBP file functions similar to a .PDF file. It is an exported version of the PCB layout and used to create stencils. The stencils are then used to apply paste to boards for adding surface-mount devices (SMD), like pads. It is meant to be viewed and referenced but not edited.",
      "NOTE: The Gerber format was originally developed by Gerber Systems but is now maintained by Ucamco."
