      "FLP files do not store the actual audio that appears in the project. Instead, the files contain references to the audio files. Therefore, if you move an FLP file or the files it references, such as a .WAV sample file, or SimSynth or DrumSynth preset file, the project may not play correctly in FL Studio.",
