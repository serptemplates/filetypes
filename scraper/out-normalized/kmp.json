      "Nintendo originally created KMP files for use in the official Mario Kart Wii tracks; however, fans and modders also utilize them when designing custom courses. The KMP format is divided into multiple sections, with each section describing a specific aspect of the course.",
      "The sections include racer start points, checkpoints, camera placements, respawn locations, and object positions such as item boxes or obstacles. Together, these elements determine how the game engine interprets the layout and interactive features of the track during gameplay.",
