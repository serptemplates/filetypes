      "The Amiga was created by Commodore International and was one of the earliest PCs to support advanced graphics, sound, and video. Its superior multimedia capabilities made it quite popular among gamers, music enthusiasts, video producers, and other creatives. However, as other companies released computers and game consoles that matched or surpassed the Amiga's capabilities, the Amiga faded from the PC market."
