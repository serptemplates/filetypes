      "Like other types of ransomware, Devos ransomware maliciously encrypts a user's files to prevent the user from opening them. It then renames the encrypted files to use the .devos extension and produces ransom notes named info.hta and info.txt.",
      "Usually, Devos ransomware also adds a user ID and email address to infected files' names. The email address that appears in infected files' names is the address users are meant to contact to pay a ransom and restore their files. Some newer versions of Devos, however, do not add an ID and email address to encrypted files' names.",
      "Devos ransomware is most commonly distributed within malicious email attachments and programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently opened an unknown email attachment or downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by Devos ransomware."
