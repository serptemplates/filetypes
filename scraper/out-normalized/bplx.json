      "Directional boring is also known as horizontal directional drilling (HDD). It is a method of installing cables, conduits, or underground pipe along an underground bore path. The Field Scout app allows you to plan and report on bore paths to improve drill efficiency. Since it is available for mobile devices, the app can be used to walk along paths with the aid of GPS then share the plan with others by uploading it to the Commander 7 HDD Guidance Display.",
