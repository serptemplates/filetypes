      "The Hit'n'Mix ripping technology separates out different parts of the audio spectrum and allows users to mix and match the separated segments. For example, a user may adjust the timing of song vocals, add sound effects to instruments, enhance the volume of specific parts, remove unwanted noise, or delete sections of a song. The interface allows users to drag and drop audio segments anywhere on the timeline and between separated tracks.",
      "RIP files do not store waveform data as in .WAV or MP3 files. Instead, they store information required to recreate, or re-synthesize, the audio data. The saved amplitude and frequency of audio mix segments allow the audio to be regenerated indistinguishably from the original audio.",
      "Hit'n'Mix can open up to three RIP files in the program at a time. When playing back RIP files, the user interface shows the generated waveforms as they are played."
