      "Users can create GPC files and compile them with Zen Studio or GTuner IV IDEs. Once compiled without errors, they add their script to a compatible gaming controller adapter, such as a Cronus Zen or Titan 2 device, and connect it to their controller, such as a PlayStation or Xbox controller, via Bluetooth or a port. The gaming controller adapter acts as a bridge, translating the input signals (defined in the GPC script) from the controller into a format that the connected system (e.g., a gaming console or computer) understands.",
      "NOTE: The CronusMAX and Titan device teams developed the GPC language specifically for use with their gaming controller adapters and software platforms. These teams are part of Collective Minds, a company specializing in gaming peripherals and customization tools."
