      "In 1996, Teeny Weeny Games (now known as Perfect Entertainment) released Discworld II, the second of a series of point-and-click adventure games based on Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. Discworld II and its sequel, Discworld Noir, played in-game cutscenes that were saved as BMV video files. Discworld II and Discworld Noir used differently-formatted BMV files, even though both games' cutscenes were saved with the .bmv extension. For example, Discworld II's BMV files did not contain a header, while Discworld Noir's BMV files did."
