      "Microsoft Visio is often utilized in business settings to organize, visualize, and communicate complex workflows, such as organizational charts, database models, business flowcharts, and software and network diagrams. Visio comes with VSSX files pre-installed, and users may create them, as well.",
      "Microsoft introduced the VSSX format when it released Visio 2013. VSSX is a Zip-based format that replaced the binary-based VSS format, which was utilized by Visio in the 2000s.",
      "NOTE: Visio 2013 and later versions still support VSS files. However, the VSSX format is the default format used by Visio to save stencils."
