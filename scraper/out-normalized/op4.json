      "The OP4 file is commonly used to exchange Craig Bampton models between different organizations for analysis. The model consists of large finite element models reduced into a set of small matrices (contained in the OP4 file) that contain mass, stiffness, and mode shape information which can then be connected to physical boundary points to test the low frequency response modes of the structure. The matrices are ideal for manipulation, which makes them easy to test in a wide range of analyses."
