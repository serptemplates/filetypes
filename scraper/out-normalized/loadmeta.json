      "Squad Kerbal Space Program is a popular rocket construction and space flight simulation game. The game allows you to save your progress as SFS files, which you can open to load your saved game.",
      "When you load your saved progress from an SFS file by accessing the Load Game dialog in Kerbal Space Program, the game compares the hash in the LOADMETA file to the hash in the SVS file. After verifying it accompanies the SFS file, the game loads the cached information in the LOADMETA file instead of parsing all of the data in the SVS file.",
