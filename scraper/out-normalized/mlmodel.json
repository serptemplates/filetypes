      "Create ML is an Apple Xcode component that macOS developers can use to create and train machine learning models. Specifically, developers use Create ML to create Core ML machine learning models, which are optimized for integration into Xcode applications.",
      "After a developer finishes using an .MLPROJ file to create a machine learning model, Create ML saves the model in an MLMODEL file. The developer can then open their model in Apple Xcode, to view the model's metadata and preview its capabilities.",
      "For example, a developer who uses Create ML to create an image classification model can open that model's MLMODEL file in Xcode and test its image classification capabilities. To do so, the developer double-clicks the MLMODEL file, selects the Preview tab, and either drags and drops an image in Xcode or selects the + button to add images and test their model. Not all types of models include the Preview tab, but all models do include the Predictions tab, which developers can use to view the inputs and outputs a model accepts and generates.",
      "Developers who are satisfied with their MLMODEL file's prediction methods and outputs can integrate the model into Xcode applications. For detailed instructions on how to add an MLMODEL to an Xcode project, click here."
