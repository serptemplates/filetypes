Only Password Agent can decrypt and display the stored information.",
      "You can open PWA files through Password Agent, which prompts for the master password before displaying any stored data. Once unlocked, the software enables you to view, add to, or update your saved entries. Without the correct password, the database remains encrypted, preventing unauthorized access to its contents."
