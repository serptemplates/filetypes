      "Individuals, such as hobbyists and photographers, who create digital scrapbooks, slideshows, or interactive photo presentations with Master Album Maker are the most likely to encounter MMP files. The files serve as a working format for editing and organizing albums before producing a final shareable version.",
      "Because MMP files only link to external media, the original images and audio files must remain in the same location for the project to open correctly. If the linked files are moved or deleted, the album project may display missing content. When the project is complete, Master Album Maker can export the album to a standalone format that others can view without the software."
