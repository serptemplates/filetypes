      "Super Mario Maker is a Wii U game that allows players to create, play, and share their own Super Mario courses. These courses are typically saved within course-specific directories (named course###) on the hard drive of a player's Wii U.",
      "Each course's directory includes a .CDT file, two .TNL files, and a BWV file. The BWV file contains the background music and sound effects that play in that course. While most players will never encounter Super Mario Maker's BWV files, modders and other Super Mario Maker enthusiasts may encounter BWV files while examining save data they've extracted from their Wii U."
