      "In 2014, French hackers Jankenpopp and Zombectro created Windows 93. The web-based \"operating system,\" which can be found at Windows93.net, allows users to access a number of clever, comedic programs, including:",
      "A \"finished\" version of Half-Life 3 that never progresses past the loading screen",
      "A Minesweeper variant called BrianSweeper that the user can never win",
      "An Internet Explorer variant called Cat Explorer that allows users to access 90s-themed webpages",
      "When a user right-clicks a Windows 93 desktop shortcut and selects Download As..., the user's web browser downloads an LNK42 file. LNK42 files contain information Windows 93 uses to open an associated program. For example, the file Recorder.lnk42 contains information (\"exe\":\"recorder\") Windows 93 uses to open its Recorder program.",
      "In some cases, LNK42 files also include the path at which a shortcut's icon can be found. Continuing the prior example, Recorder.lnk42 tells users its icon is located at /​c/​sys/​skins/​w93/​apps/​recorder.png in Windows 93."
