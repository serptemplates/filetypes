      "Movie Collector was a desktop program that allowed you to manage your physical and digital movie libraries, offering tools to organize, search, and filter movie details. When you save a catalog with Movie Collector, the program creates an MVC file to store its contents, which you can back up or share with other Movie Collector users.",
