      "Adobe developed the EPS format in the late 1980s to become a standard for exchanging images across different platforms and devices. While various applications and users adopted the format, other image formats overshadowed it, such as .JPEG and .PNG.",
      "Although EPS never became as widely used as Adobe intended, graphics professionals commonly save their artwork in the format, such as icons and drawings. For example, graphic designers often use professional vector image editors, such as Adobe Illustrator or Serif Affinity Designer, to save artwork as EPS files for large print jobs (e.g., posters, banners, and billboard advertisements) because of the format's scalability."

      "A typical EPS file contains a preview image in a format intended for convenient use in a workflow that involves several systems or applications. The intent of a preview is to have an image in a format that most graphics applications can render; a preview is usually of lower resolution, in pixel dimensions and/or in bit-depth. The preview file can be in one of a number of formats. The specification for EPS_3 lists three “device-specific” preview formats:\n\nfor the Apple Macintosh, a PICT image as used by the QuickDraw applicationfor DOS computers, a TIFF bitmapWindows Metafile.\n\nPICT and Windows Metafile can incorporate both bitmap data and vector graphics. In addition, the specification defines a very simple device-independent representation for an embedded bitmapped preview image. This representation is known as Encapsulated PostScript Interchange Format (EPSI).\n\nAn EPSI preview is a bitmap represented as ASCII hexadecimal, wrapped between a few PostScript comments for identification and intended to be simple and easily transportable. In order to distinguish EPS files with the different preview formats, different DOS file extensions and Macintosh file types were recommended in the EPS specification.",
      "You can open an EPS file with various image editors, including Adobe Illustrator, QuarkXpress, and Serif Affinity Designer. For example, to open an EPS file with Illustrator, select File → Open.",
      "Some other options include GIMP, which is a free cross-platform image editor, and CorelDRAW Graphics Suite, which is available for Windows and macOS."
