      "When Mario Kart Wii players collide, are hit by projectiles, accelerate rapidly, and perform other in-game actions, their Wiimotes (Nintendo Wii controllers) may vibrate. These vibrations are controlled by Mario Kart Wii's KRM file, which is named vibration.krm. Vibration.krm contains binary data that specifies when and how Mario Kart Wii players' Wiimotes should vibrate.",
      "Most Mario Kart Wii players will never encounter vibration.krm. However, those who enjoy modding Mario Kart Wii can extract vibration.krm from the game's Common.szs file and edit it using player-created mod tools."
