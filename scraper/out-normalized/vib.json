      "VMWare vSphere is a cloud computing virtualization platform that allows businesses and other organizations to create, run, and manage many virtual machines. VSphere includes a hypervisor component called ESXi, which allows administrators to, among other things, install image profiles on host computers.",
      "Each ESXi image profile is comprised of multiple VIB files. These files contain applications, drivers, updates, and patches. Each VIB file is comprised of an archive that contains the file's actual software package, an .XML file that describes the VIB file's contents, and an electronic signature file that denotes the VIB file's VMware certification level.",
      "NOTE: Multiple related VIB files are often packaged together within software bundles or depots."
