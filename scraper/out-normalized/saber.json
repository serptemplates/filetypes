      "For example, you can download and install Beat Saber Mod Manager and select the Custom Sabers option during installation to use that program to import custom sabers. After you install Beat Saber Mod Manager, a Custom Sabers directory will appear in Beat Saber's Beat Saber directory. Place your SABER files in that directory, and they will appear in-game on the Custom Saber menu."
