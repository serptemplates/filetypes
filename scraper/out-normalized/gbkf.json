      "Rafael Senties Martinelli, the creator of the web-based tool CAD-Viewer.com, developed the GBKF format in 2025 to reduce the amount of data exchanged between CAD-Viewer.com's servers and clients. Martinelli created the first version of GBKF specifically for the CAD-Viewer.com platform, and refactored it into a core specification with extensions to make it more general-purpose. Developers can also adapt the format for other applications, such as databases, messaging systems, or media storage."
