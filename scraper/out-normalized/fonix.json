      "In June 2020, some PC users began reporting that their computers had been infected by a new form of ransomware called Fonix. The ransomware encrypts a variety of users' files using four methods of encryption, renames the files to use the .fonix or .xinof extensions, and produces a ransom message named # How to Decrypt Files #.hta. Between June 2020 and January 2021, Fonix infected over 5,000 PCs.",
      "In January 2021, the criminals behind Fonix decided to stop producing the ransomware and to provide decryption companies with the keys needed to decrypt FONIX files. As a result, numerous groups have produced free Fonix decryptors that can be used to restore users' files."
