      "2FAS is an Android and iOS app that allows users to add two-factor authentication to a variety of online services, such as Dropbox, Slack, Facebook, and Discord. After a user connects 2FAS to a service, the app displays a two-factor authentication code for that service. 2FAS refreshes these codes every 30 seconds, using tokens associated with each service.",
      "2FAS Auth encourages 2FAS users to create a backup of their 2FAS tokens, by exporting the tokens within a 2FAS file. This ensures the user can continue using 2FAS without interruption if, for example, they switch phones or accidentally delete 2FAS from their phone. Users can manually create 2FAS files from within 2FAS, or they can set 2FAS to automatically create 2FAS files, which the app stores in users' Google Drive or iCloud accounts."
