      "IFM files are designed to store the data of a form (ITP file) created by Informed Designer. The forms can be filled out, approved, signed, and submitted electronically using Informed Filler. Some examples of forms include invoices, applications, and preferences for serving military duty.",
      "The data from the IFM file is used to fill in the appropriate records in the ITP form. An IFM file cannot store data for multiple forms, only one. If you delete the IFM file, the data in the form will be erased.",
      "NOTE: Informed Designer and Filler were prominently used in the 1990s but have since been discontinued."
