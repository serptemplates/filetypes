      "Satellite is an app that specializes in resin-based 3D printing. This additive manufacturing method uses liquid resin (curing layer by layer with light) to create highly detailed and precise 3D objects. It is particularly well-suited for producing intricate designs with smooth finishes.",
      "The software offers various tools for model editing, slicing, and printer management for casual and professional users who own ELEGOO printers, such as the Neptune 3 Pro and Mars 4 Ultra. For example, a user can prepare 3D models (such as .STL or .OBJ files) by scaling, rotating, and adjusting them with the app and then slice 3D models into layers to export the instructions in the proprietary .GOO format required by an ELEGOO printer to produce the object."
