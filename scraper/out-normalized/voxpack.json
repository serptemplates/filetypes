      "Several Gameloft video games, including Asphalt 9: Legends, Disney Magic Kingdoms, Sonic Runners Adventure, and Sniper Fury, include VOXPACK files. These archives store the game's music, saved in various lengths and formats. (For example, a VOXPACK file might include a 30 minute, 60 minute, 90 minute, and 120 minute version of the same song.) They also contain a music.voxdata file. This file contains data that the game uses to load and play music correctly."
