      "Since FFF files store uncompressed image data, the files can become very large, typically in the 100s of MBs range. Therefore, if you want to share an image captured as an FFF file, you should convert it to a more widely supported format, such as .JPEG, .PNG, or .TIFF. Converting the FFF image to one of these formats compresses the image data, making it easier to share it online.",
