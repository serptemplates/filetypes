      "Prior to Camtasia 2020, the Windows version of Camtasia saved users' in-progress video projects as CAMPROJ files. These files contained information used to load a user's project and its component media clips in Camtasia.",
      "If a Camtasia user needed to transfer their project between Windows PCs, they could export their CAMPROJ file as a .ZIP package, which stored all their project data (including the project's component media files) in a single file. After a user finished editing their Camtasia project, they could use their CAMPROJ file to export the video they had created as an .AVI, .MP4, or .M4V file.",
      "While the Windows version of Camtasia, called Camtasia Studio, used the CAMPROJ extension, the Mac version, called Camtasia for Mac, used the .CMPROJ extension. Because of this, users could not transfer Camtasia project files between platforms."
