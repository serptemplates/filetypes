      "In Mine Blocks, players explore randomly-generated 2D worlds, in which they encounter creatures and can build structures. The game can be played in Survival, Creative, and Hardcore mode. In Survival and Hardcore mode, players are meant to survive as long as they can. In Creative mode, players can roam around the world as they please, without the possibility of dying.",
      "If a player wants to back up the current state of a Mine Blocks world, they can do so by selecting that world on the world selection screen and then clicking Save to file. This saves the world, and the player's current state and progress, as an MBW file. Players can then load the MBW file in either version of Mine Blocks to resume their game.",
      "NOTE: Players can also back up multiple Mine Blocks worlds in an .MBWB file."
