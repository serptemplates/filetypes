      "After you've finished editing your VRChat world in Unity, you can upload it to VRChat for use as a VRChat world. To do so, open the VRChat SDK Build Control Panel (VRChat SDK → Show Control Panel → Builder) in Unity. Then select Publish New Build and follow the on-screen instructions to upload your world. (This process will transform your world into a VRCW file.)",
      "To access your VRChat worlds from within VRChat, open the Worlds Menu and select the Mine tab. Your uploaded worlds will appear within the Worlds Menu."
