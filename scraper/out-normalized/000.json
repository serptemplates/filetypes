      "The Indexing Service search index is typically created in the following directory:",
      "C:\\​System Volume Information\\​catalog.wci",
      "The index may also be generated for external volumes connected to a Windows computer, such as USB flash drives.",
      "If you have a slow CPU, you should consider disabling indexing or selectively disabling indexing on your computer. To do this, click Start or the search bar in Windows and type \"indexing\" in the search field. Then, click Indexing Options and remove locations in Windows that you no longer want to be indexed. This will increase the amount of time it takes Windows to search these locations but will also improve the performance of the CPU."
