      "You can open _DOCX files with the same applications that support DOCX files. However, you may need to rename the _DOCX files by changing the ._docx extension to .docx. After renaming the file, you can open it with Microsoft Word in Windows and macOS. The software is also available for Android and iOS devices.",
      "Some other programs that can open _DOCX files include Apache OpenOffice Writer (multiplatform), Kingsoft Writer (multiplatform), and Apple Pages (Mac and iOS). If you are a Mac user simply looking to view a _DOCX file, you can use Apple Preview, which comes bundled with macOS.",
      "You can also upload _DOCX files to the Google Docs web application (also available as a mobile app). The application enables you to view, edit, save, and convert the document."
