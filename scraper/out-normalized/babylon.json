      "Babylon.js is a rendering engine that developers can use to create 3D scenes and import them into webpages and web applications. To do so, developers code 3D scenes using JavaScript and imported Babylon.js assets. The scenes that developers create are most often saved as BABYLON files, though they may also be saved as .GLB files.",
      "BABYLON files can reference other BABYLON files, allowing developers to create and display complex scenes. After a developer finishes their scene(s), they can display the scene in their webpage or app by importing requisite babylon.js scripts into their webpage or app's HTML, generating the babylon.js engine, and then copying the code their BABYLON file contains into their page or app's HTML.",
      "NOTE: More information on how to create and use BABYLON files is available in babylon.js's documentation, located at doc.babylonjs.com."
