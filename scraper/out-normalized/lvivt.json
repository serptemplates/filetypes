      "The LVIVT format acts as a wrapper for the game's executable, meaning it does not contain playable game data on its own. Instead, the file must be decoded to restore the original EXE file before the game can be launched. Encoding the file helps preserve the integrity of the game's internal resources, such as scripts, assets, or compiled logic, ensuring that the program behaves as intended.",
