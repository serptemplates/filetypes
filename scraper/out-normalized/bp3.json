      "AutoCAD is a professional computer-aided design CAD) application for creating 2D and 3D drawings of industrial parts, buildings, city streets, parks, vehicles, furniture, and other items. The software creates BP3 files to allow you to save lists of files you commonly publish to printers or plotters, which saves you time so you do not have to recreate the list of files each time you want to publish the same files or sheets.",
      "Autodesk introduced the BP3 file type when it released AutoCAD 2000 in 1999, replacing .BPL and .BP2 files supported by versions 1 to 14 of AutoCAD. Now, AutoCAD allows you to save your publishing lists as .DSD files."
