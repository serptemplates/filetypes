      "Kurzweil introduced the K2000 in the early 1990s as a digital synthesizer capable of sample-based synthesis using its Variable Architecture Synthesis Technology (V.A.S.T.) engine. Users often saved their custom sounds and compositions to floppy disks in KRZ format for later use or for transfer between devices. While primarily associated with the K2000, some later models like the K2500 and K2600 also supported this format."
