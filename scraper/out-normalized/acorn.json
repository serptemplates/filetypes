      "Acorn is a macOS-only image editor that allows you to add text, shapes, and effects to images, as well as make other adjustments. Like Adobe Photoshop, Acorn allows you to add elements and make adjustments using layers, which keep some image elements separate from others. This allows you to edit the element(s) stored in one layer without affecting others. (For example, you can add, move, and edit a text layer without affecting your background image.)",
      "Primarily, images created in Acorn are saved as ACORN files. The ACORN format preserves an image's layers, so you can continue editing them in the future. Acorn allows you to save images in other formats, but many of these formats \"flatten\" the image into a single layer, making additional editing more difficult."
