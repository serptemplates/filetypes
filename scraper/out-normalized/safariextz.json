      "Previously, developers could use Safari's Extension Builder (Develop → Show Extension Builder) to create Safari extensions. These extension development projects were saved in folders named .safariextension. After a developer finished creating their extension, they could build the extension into a SAFARIEXTZ file.",

To install a SAFARIEXTZ file, users typically placed the file in their [user]/​Library/​Safari/​Extensions directory.",
