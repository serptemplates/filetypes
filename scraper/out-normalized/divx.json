      "The DivX format is based on MPEG-4 Part 2 video compression and has evolved to support advanced features like multiple audio tracks, subtitles, chapters, and menu navigation. While it began as a proprietary format for Windows-based PCs, support for DivX playback expanded over time to include many third-party media players, DVD and Blu-ray players, gaming consoles, and smart TVs. However, the format has become less common in recent years due to the rise of newer codecs like H.264 and H.265."
