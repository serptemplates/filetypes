      "Houdini Apprentice is available in free and HD editions. While the free edition allows stills and animations up to a 720x576 resolution, the HD version allows 1920x1080 animations and has no limit on still image resolutions. The HD edition removes the watermark placed on the free version's images and animations.",
      "NOTE: HIPNC stands for Houdini Project Non-Commercial, since these files are not for commercial use. The full commercial version of Houdini uses .HIP files."
