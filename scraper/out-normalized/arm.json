      "The Armory 3D development team has created multiple 3D modeling and video game creation applications. Two of their most noteworthy apps are ArmorPaint, an app that allows 3D artists to texture, paint, and save 3D models, and Armory, a Blender add-on that game makers can use to make building video games in Blender easier.",
      "When an artist saves a project in ArmorPaint, it is saved as an ARM file. Additionally, when a game maker exports an Armory-created game from Blender, Blender produces a number of compiled files related to that game. Some of these files are ARM files. No matter what program created them, ARM files contain 3D models, environments, meshes, scenes, or other assets."
