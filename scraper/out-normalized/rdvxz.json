      "RedVox Infrasound Recorder is an Android app (no longer available for iOS) that allows you to record low-frequency sounds generated by volcanic eruptions, sonic booms, meteors, earthquakes, and other significant audial events. Infrasound Recorder records this audio using your smartphone's microphone and, if available, barometer. The app saves recorded audio as RDVXZ files.",
