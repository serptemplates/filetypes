      "Each Microsoft Office application uses its own OFFICEUI file, which is named accordingly. For example, Microsoft Word's OFFICEUI file is named Word.officeui. When you make changes to Microsoft Word's ribbon, the changes are saved in Word's OFFICEUI file. They are not applied to Excel, PowerPoint, or other Office applications' ribbons. If you want to customize every Microsoft Office ribbon, you must do so manually from within each individual Office application.",
      "To customize an application's ribbon, right-click in the ribbon and select Customize the Ribbon.... Then, make your changes. Advanced users can also modify a ribbon's XML code directly in its corresponding OFFICEUI file. OFFICEUI files are located in one of the following directories:",
      "%LocalAppData%/​Microsoft/​Office (Windows with Roaming Registry Key not set)",
      "%AppData%/​Microsoft/​Office (Windows with Roaming Registry Key set)",
      "Users/​~/​Library/​Containers/​{Office App Name}/​Data/​Library/​Preferences (Mac)",
      "To share the ribbon stored in an OFFICEUI file with another Microsoft Office user, you must export the ribbon's settings within an .EXPORTEDUI file. To do so:",
