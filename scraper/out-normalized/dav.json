      "DVR365 and Dahua Technology video surveillance systems use one or more DVR cameras to record surveillance footage. For example, DVR365 systems may use DSD304, DSSD308, or DSD316 DVR cameras. The DVR saves the footage these cameras record as DAV files.",
      "DAV files are encrypted to prevent unauthorized users from playing them and are meant to be played using the system that created them. However, some downloadable media players can play DAV files, and various tools allow users to convert DAV files to more common video formats, such as .AVI",
      "NOTE: Many other companies sell CCTV systems that are rebranded Dahua Technology systems. These systems may also produce DAV files."
