      "While HPKG files are typically installed using HaikuDepot, they can also be installed with pkgman in Terminal. If you are installing an HPKG manually, place the HPKG file in /​system/​packages/​. Installed applications can be found in /​system/​apps/​.",
      "The Haiku operating system (OS) was inspired by BeOS, which was an OS developed in the 1990s. The first beta of Haiku was released in September 2018. The HPKG file format replaced .ZIP and .PKG archives, which were previously used by BeOS for storing applications."
