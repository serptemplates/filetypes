      "Several models of Kodak DC-Series digital cameras, including the DC40, DC50, DC120, save photos as KDC files. These files contain all the data captured when a photographer took a picture. Retaining this data in its original, unprocessed format allows photographers to edit image elements, such as color temperature and exposure, more precisely.",
      "However, because KDC files contain a lot of data, they typically have quite large file sizes. For this reason, photographers typically convert KDC files to other formats after they've finished editing them in Kodak or third-party photo editing software.",
      "NOTE: Kodak EasyShare P-Series and Z-Series cameras also save photos as KDC files. However, those cameras' KDC files are not formatted the same as DC-Series cameras' KDC files."

    "instructions": [
      "You can use Logipole Konvertor (Windows) or XnViewMP (multiplatform) to convert KDC files to other image formats. For example, XnViewMP can convert KDC files to the following formats (and many others):",
      ".JPEG - JPEG Image",
      ".GIF - Graphical Interchange Format",
      ".PNG - Portable Network Graphic",
      ".TIFF - Tagged Image",
      ".BMP - Bitmap Image",
      ".PCX - Paintbrush Bitmap Image",
      ".TGA - Targa Graphic",
      ".JP2 - JPEG 2000 Core Image",
      ".JXR - JPEG XR Image",
      ".WEBP - WebP Image",
      "Keep in mind that converting KDC file to a non-raw format will remove the raw data it contains. Therefore, you may want to keep a copy of your KDC file for future editing."
