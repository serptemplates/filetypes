      "Scatter ransomware, also known as [email protected] ransomware, is a trojan horse that you may have downloaded via a spam email attachment. After you open the attachment, the ransomware executes a process named either Trojan-Ransom.Win32.Scatter or Trojan-Ransom.BAT.Scatter. These processes encrypt your files and append them with the .good, .crypt, or .pzdc extension.",
      "After encrypting your files, Scatter ransomware produces a ransom note that contains instructions you are supposed to follow to pay a ransom and unlock your files. However, you do not need to pay a ransom to unlock your files. Instead, you can use Kaspersky ScatterDecryptor tool to decrypt your files for free. (Also, FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files.)"
