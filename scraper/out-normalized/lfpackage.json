      "LumaFusion is a multitrack video editor available for macOS and iOS. It allows you to import video, audio, and image files and splice those files together into polished movies, using timeline-based editing and effects. While LumaFusion is available for Mac and iPhone, it is meant to be used on iPads.",
      "If you want to transfer a LumaFusion project between devices or share it with another user, you can do so by saving and sharing the project as an LFPACKAGE file. Each LFPACKAGE file contains all the data needed to load that project in LumaFusion, including a copy of any assets you've imported into the project and a record of the project's cuts, transitions, effects, and levels.",
