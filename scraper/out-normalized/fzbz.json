      "Arduino and printed circuit board (PCB) enthusiasts use Fritzing to prototype PCB layouts. These layouts contain a variety of circuit parts, which users store and organize in Fritzing part bins.",
      "Typically, Fritzing part bins are saved as FZB files, which are XML files that describe the parts a bin includes. However, when a user exports a bin, the bin is saved as an FZBZ file, which is a compressed archive that contains not only the bin's FZB file, but also the FZP and SVG files needed to import the bin into another instance of Fritzing. This allows users to easily export and share their parts bins with other users.",
