      "Squad Kerbal Space Program is a popular rocket construction and space flight simulation game. It is available for many platforms, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.",
      "The game stores a player's current game state, including all their in-progress flights, in a file named persistent.sfs. This file is a plain text file, which Kerbal Space Program modders can open and edit to make changes to their in-progress games. For example, a player can edit persistent.sfs to give themself more money.",
      "Kerbal Space Program also allows players to create \"quicksaves\" of their game to revert back to previous game states. For example, a player might want to revert to a previous state if one of their rockets crashes. These quicksaves are named quicksave.sfs."
