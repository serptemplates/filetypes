      "NPS Image Editor is a lightweight pixel art, drawing, and photo editing application available for Windows. It allows users to create and save layer-based images as NPSD files, also known as NPS Image Editor Documents.",
      "Layer-based editing allows users to add and edit different image elements without interfering with other elements. For example, an NPS Image Editor user could add a text element on one image layer, add a shape element on a different image layer, and edit both entirely separately, without modifying the other.",
      "After a user has finished editing the image their NPSD file contains, they can use NPS Image Editor to export the image as a .JPG, .GIF, .PNG, .TIF, or .BMP image, for use in other image viewing and editing programs. Doing so will \"flatten\" the image, compressing all its layers into a single layer."
