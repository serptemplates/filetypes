      "CAA files are typically used by Chinese students and researchers. The files are very small in size since they only contain a short string of text. The size allows users to more easily share links to large journal downloads.",
      "When a CAA file is double-clicked it is opened by CNKI CAJViewer, which begins the downloading of the journal. Once the download begins, a control window opens that displays the name of the journal being downloaded, the file size, and the download rate.",
