      "QuickRoute is a free program that allows hikers, runners, bicyclists, travel enthusiasts, and others to plot data recorded using a Garmin, Fitbit, or other GPS device on an image of a map. For example, runners can import data recorded during a run into QuickRoute and overlay that data on a map image. Runners can also review the split time and pace information their device recorded.",
      "After aligning their GPS data with their map image, QuickRoute users can save their finalized map as a QRT file. QRT files can be opened only in QuickRoute, but QuickRoute users can use QRT files to show route information in Google Earth (by selecting Tools → Open in Google Earth from QuickRoute's menu bar), publish their maps to a web service (by selecting Tools → Publish map...), or export their map as an image (by selecting File → Export → Image...)."
