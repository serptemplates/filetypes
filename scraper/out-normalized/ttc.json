      "A TTC file consists of a TTC Header table, Table Directories, and multiple OpenType tables. The TTC Header must be found at the start of the file. A complete table directory for each font must be existed. The TableDirectory format should be similar as existed in a non-collection file. The table counts in all directories within a TTC file are calculated from the start of a TTC file. The tables in a TTC file are referenced through the table directory of their respective fonts. A few of the OpenType tables must appear multiple times, once for each font added in the TTC. Whereas the other tables may be shared by multiple fonts in the TTC file.",
      "TTC files allow multiple fonts to share glyph sets, which reduces the overall disk space required by the fonts. TrueType Font Collections are most often used for East Asian languages, such as Japanese and Korean."
