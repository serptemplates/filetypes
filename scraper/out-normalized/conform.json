      "Conformalizer was an audio post-production program that allowed audio producers to map audio tracks, including dialogue, music, and sound effect tracks, to a picture cut (of a film or TV show). When Conformalizer mapped audio to a picture cut, it recorded the changes it made to the audio and picture cut in a CONFORM file. Doing so allowed producers to revert to previous versions of their project's audio and picture cut if needed.",
