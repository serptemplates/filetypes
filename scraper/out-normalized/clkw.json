      "Clicker is a child-focused writing tool that allows children to write sentences and stories by selecting words, phrases, and images from grids. (Advanced users can also use an in-app keyboard.) The app includes a Pop-up Word Bank feature, which allows users to open a default word bank that contains common words.",
      "These pop-up word banks are saved as CLKW files (in contrast to normal grid sets, which are saved as .CLKX files). Users create CLKW files by opening their current pop-up word bank, editing it, and selecting File → Save Word Bank As. By default, Clicker stores word banks in its Word Banks directory.",
      "NOTE: A user's pop-up word bank can also be set to open from within a grid set, using the Add Pop-up Grid tool."

You'll then be able to set the CLKW file as your primary word bank (by opening User Preferences and selecting your file in the Writing → Pop-up Word Bank section). After setting the CLKW file as your primary word bank, you can use the Pop-up Word Bank feature to open it."
