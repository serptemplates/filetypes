      "The Aurora virus is highly dangerous malware. It is commonly referred to as ransomware, where the purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator (typically approximately $100 USD of bitcoin) to unlock your files. The virus is a trojan horse that is typically introduced through a personal .DOC file attached to an email. Once the virus affects your computer it begins scrambling your files, renaming them, and encrypting them. The virus then generates a .TXT ransom note named HOW_TO_DECRYPT_YOUR_FILES.txt, which informs you of the takeover and what you are meant to do to recover your files."
