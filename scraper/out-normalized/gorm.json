      "GNUstep developers typically use GORM files in Objective-C applications to separate interface design from logic. This separation allows for easier collaboration, since designers can build the UI in Gorm while programmers write the underlying functionality.",
      "GORM files are similar in function to .NIB or .XIB files used in Apple's Interface Builder for macOS and iOS development. However, GORM files are used specifically within the GNUstep framework, which is an open-source implementation of Apple's Cocoa (formerly NeXTSTEP) APIs. The file format allows developers to load and display interface elements only when needed, which can help optimize application performance."
