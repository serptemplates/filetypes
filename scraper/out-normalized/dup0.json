      "When a Kies user syncs their Samsung device with their PC, Kies sometimes creates extraneous copies of the user's media files. These files have the same name as the original file but use the .dup0 extension instead of the original file's extension. Kies does not require these files to function, and they cannot be opened normally. So, DUP0 files are largely useless.",
      "In some scenarios, Kies may end up creating multiple extraneous copies of the same media file. In these scenarios, the additional duplicates will use the .dup1, .dup2, and so on extensions.",
      "Yes, you can safely delete DUP0 files. DUP0 files are duplicates of existing media files stored on your Samsung device, and you do not need to keep them.",
      "Additionally, if you have a large amount of DUP0 files on your device's SD card, you may be able to automatically delete all your DUP0 files by unmounting and remounting your device's SD card."

      "DUP0 files are not meant to be opened. However, if you really want to open a DUP0 file, you can attempt to do so by renaming the file to use the correct extension and then opening it in an appropriate program. For example, if you want to view the contents of a DUP0 file created from a JPG file, you can rename the file to use the .jpg extension and then open it in an image-viewing application."
