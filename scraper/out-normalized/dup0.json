However, if you really want to open a DUP0 file, you can attempt to do so by renaming the file to use the correct extension and then opening it in an appropriate program. For example, if you want to view the contents of a DUP0 file created from a JPG file, you can rename the file to use the .jpg extension and then open it in an image-viewing application."
