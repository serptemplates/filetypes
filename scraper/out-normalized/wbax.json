      "WorldBox is a \"god simulator\" available for PC, Android, and iOS. It allows players to create and manage simulated worlds. Throughout their gameplay, players can manually save their worlds as WBOX files.",
      "In versions 0.13.2 and higher, WorldBox also automatically saves players' worlds at regular intervals. This allows the player to load a previous version of their world or restore the world if their WBOX file is damaged or goes missing. These autosaves are saved as WBAX files (and saved in the same locations as WBOX files)."
