      "Musicians use VOCALOID to create synthesized vocal tracks consisting of notes, lyrics, and virtual singing voices. Each VOCALOID version uses a different project file format. For example, VOCALOID5 and VOCALOID6 save projects as VPR files, while older versions used VSQX or .VSQ files.",
      "Although VOCALOID5 and VOCALOID6 no longer save projects in the VSQX format, they can still open VSQX files created in earlier versions. If a user imports a VSQX project and saves it in VOCALOID5 or VOCALOID6, the software converts it to the VPR format."
