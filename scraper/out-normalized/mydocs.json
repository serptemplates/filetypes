      "The \"Send To → My Documents\" option allows users to quickly copy the selected item to their My Documents folder, a default location where many users store personal files such as documents, images, and spreadsheets. Casual or everyday users primarily use the \"Send To → My Documents\" feature when they quickly want to move or back up files to their My Documents folder without manually navigating through folders. Advanced users or system administrators might also use or modify SendTo shortcuts to streamline file organization tasks.",
