      "Autodesk ReCap Pro is a 3D scanning software used to create digital representations of buildings, structures, and environments. These 3D models, which are created using either photographs or laser scans of the to-be-modeled area, are saved as RCM files.",
      "In the past, ReCap users could import RCM models into Autodesk ReMake, in order to create movies or VR experiences featuring RCM models. Autodesk ReMake has since been discontinued, but Autodesk users can still use ReCap Photo to create RCM models and export them in a variety of 3D model formats, for use in other Autodesk and 3D modeling programs."
