      "In the past, Android users could create BACKUP files by accessing their device's System Recovery Mode and selecting the option to back up their data. Typically, Android devices created and stored just one BACKUP file, but on certain Android devices with limited file allocation capabilities, backups were split into 2GB files saved with the .backup, .backup1, .backup2, and so on extensions.",
      "After they were created, BACKUP1 files resided on an Android device's SD card. If needed, users could use their BACKUP files to restore their data or transfer it to a new Android device."
