      "Cyan Worlds released Riven in 1997 as the sequel to the hit game Myst. Like its predecessor, Riven focuses on exploration and environmental puzzle-solving, immersing players in a mysterious world they must navigate without combat or dialogue options. Riven generates RVN files during gameplay whenever the player manually saves or uses the game's autosave feature.",
      "The location of RVN files depends on the platform and version of Riven you're using. For example, you can find RVN files for the GOG version in Windows here:​",
