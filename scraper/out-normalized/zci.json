      "In the 1990s, ZCI Publishing, now known as Zane Publishing, published several series of educational CDs. Some of these series included Revolutions in Art & Music, U.S. Geography, and Concise Encyclopedia.",
      "Each CD contained a ZCI file, which combined the disc's text and multimedia files into a presentation and a set of related encyclopedia entries. Each CD also contained the program PowerCD (sometimes referred to as PowerCD Explorer), which learners could use to view the disc's content."
