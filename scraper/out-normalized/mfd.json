      "Many Yamaha keyboard models come with preset MFD database files. Music Finder is a feature that allows you to search the MFD files. When you search through your keyboard for songs with different styles and tempos, Music Finder searches the songs stored in the MFD databases.",
      "If you come across an MFD file on your computer you can open it in Windows with the MusicFinderView program. The program allows you to modify, replace, or delete songs. MusicFinderView also enables you to rearrange, sort, and print the list of songs stored in the file."
