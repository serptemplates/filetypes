      "Indigo Renderer is a 3D rendering application that allows artists to create photorealistic images. The software simulates the physics of light to generate images for various purposes, including architectural mockups and film special effects. Indigo Renderer is available as a standalone application or as a plugin for other 3D CAD programs.",
      "Additionally, Indigo RT is also a high-end 3D visualization application. It is similar to Indigo Renderer but offers fewer features and is less expensive.",
      "You can create a PIGM file with Indigo Renderer when saving a material you want to share or store. To create a PIGM file with Indigo Renderer, select File → New Material, choose File → Save Material As, then select \"Packed Indigo Material\" from the file type dropdown menu."
