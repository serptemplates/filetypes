      "CHD files are not meant to be opened directly by users. Instead, emulators, such as MAME and RetroArch, load the contents of a CHD file to run games. How a CHD file is opened depends on the emulator, so it’s important to consult your emulator’s documentation for specific instructions.",
      "For MAME arcade games, a CHD file must be stored in a subdirectory that matches the ROM’s filename (without the .zip extension). For example, if your ROM is named mygame.zip and your CHD file is mygame.chd, the files would typically be organized like this:",
      "/​Roms/​mygame.zip",
      "/​Roms/​mygame/​mygame.chd",
      "MAME will automatically load the CHD file when the corresponding ROM is launched.",
      "Other emulators may require all CHD files to be placed in a single directory, often named Rom or similar. Placement rules vary between emulators, so always check the documentation for the correct folder structure and naming conventions."
