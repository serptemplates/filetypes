      "DeSmuMe is an open-source Nintendo DS emulator available for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It allows players to play DS games on their PCs.",
      "In most cases, DeSmuME players save their game progress in .DST files. Players can conveniently create these save state files from DeSmuME's own menu at any point during gameplay. This allows players to save their progress at any time, not just at in-game save points.",
      "However, DeSmuME players can also save their game progress in DSV files. Unlike DST files, DSV files store a player's progress only up to their last in-game save. Primarily, players save their progress as DSV files to make it easier to transfer that progress to another Nintendo DS emulator. The DSV format is nearly identical to the SAV format, which many other emulators use.",
      "To save your game progress as a DSV file in DeSmuME, select File → Export ROM Save File.... Remember, your DSV file will contain only your progress up to your last in-game save."
