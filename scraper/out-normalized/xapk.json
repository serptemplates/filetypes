For example, after downloading an XAPK file, you can install the app (the APK file stored in the package) to an Android device using the TarrySoft XAPK or APKPure installers.",
      "However, if you would like to install the additional files manually, you can unzip the XAPK file (which is a standard .ZIP file) with a Zip utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer (Windows), Apple Archive Utility (macOS), or RARLAB WinRAR (Windows). After extracting the files in the XAPK file, you can place them in the appropriate location on your device."
