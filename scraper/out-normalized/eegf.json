      "Ransomware is a form of malware that encrypts users' files and holds them for ransom. EEGF ransomware is a variant of STOP Djvu ransomware. STOP Djvu and its variants encrypt a user's documents, images, and videos, append an extension to encrypted files, and produce a ransom note named _readme.txt in every affected folder. The ransom note contains instructions users can supposedly follow to decrypt their files.",
      "Ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by EEGF ransomware."
