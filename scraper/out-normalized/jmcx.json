      "The JMCX file is often used to encrypt confidential personal and sensitive business files. JM-Crypt also uses the \".jmc\", \".jmck\", \".jmcp\", \".jmcr\", and \".jmce\" file extensions for encrypting files.",
      "The JM-Crypt algorithm uses the one-time pad (OTP) encryption method and twice encrypts your file. The first encryption is with a random extract of a long random key generated by JM-Crypt Security's homemade fast Fourier transform (FFT) key generator. The second encryption features password protection, which depends on the method selected by the user. The password creation may be fully automatic (a random password automatically generated and featured in the JMCX file), semi-automatic (project mode), or manual (.JMC file).",
      "NOTE: In order to decrypt the JMCX file, you need the JM-Crypt software and algorithm that were used to originally encrypt the file."
