ACCDT files must contain atleast one Template metadaa part which should be the target of a relationship. This Template Metadata is the starting part of an ACCDT file.\n\nPart\n\nA part is a stream of bytes that has an associated type for specifying the nature and type of content stored in it. Parts enumeration specify valid parts, valid content types, and required relationships between all parts in a package.\n\nRelationship\n\nPackage Relationship - where target is a part and the source is the package as a whole.\n\nPart-to-Part Relationship - where the target is a part and the source is a part in the package.\n\nExplicit Relationship - where a resource is referenced from the contents of a source part by referencing a relationship element by the value of its ID attribute.\n\nImplicit Relationship - a relationship that is not explicit.\n\nInternal relationship - where the target is a part in the package.\n\nExternal relationship - where the target is an external resource not in the package.",
