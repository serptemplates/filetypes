      "Adobe Authorware was an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) that teachers and businesses used to create eLearning applications. It allowed users to design, add content to, and even manually script their applications, before publishing them via CD, DVD, or a network.",
      "Version 6 of Authorware saved users' app creation projects as A6P files. Saving a project as an A6P file allowed a user to continue editing their app, even after publication. For example, if a user found an issue with their published app, they could open the app's A6P file, fix the issue, and re-publish the fixed app.",
