      "Wheel of Names (also known as WheelOfNames.com) is a website that allows users to enter a list of names and select names randomly from that list. To make the selection process more fun, Wheel of Names shows a spinning wheel that, when clicked, spins until a name is selected. Optionally, users can customize several aspects of the selection process, including the images shown on the wheel, the sound played while the wheel spins, and the message that appears after a name is selected.",
      "If a user knows they'll use a namelist and/or customization options with Wheel of Names again, they can save their current namelist as a WHEEL file (by selecting Save from Wheel of Names' menu bar). WHEEL files are JSON-formatted plain text files that detail a namelist's title, included names, and customization options.",
      "NOTE: If a user added images to their wheel before saving a WHEEL file, the file includes either a reference to that image (if the image was loaded from Wheel of Names' Gallery) or a copy of the image's data (if the user uploaded the image from their computer)."
