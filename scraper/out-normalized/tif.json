      "The TIFF format was developed in the mid-1980s by Aldus Corporation (merged with Adobe Systems in 1994) to be a universal image format for different computer platforms and document scanners. The format became popular among professionals in the publishing industry, including photographers and graphic artists. The format's popularity was partially due to its ability to be edited and re-saved without losing image quality.",
      "TIF files can be saved in an uncompressed (lossless) format or may incorporate .JPEG (lossy) compression. They may also use LZW lossless compression, which reduces the TIF file size but does not reduce the quality of the image.",
      "NOTE: TIF files may also use the .TIFF extension."
