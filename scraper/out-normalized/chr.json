      "You will most likely only come across the Doki Doki Literature Club! CHR files if you have installed the visual novel. The CHR files are located in the \"characters\" folder in the game folder.",
      "The game does not actually open the various CHR files stored in the \"characters\" folder. Instead, it checks if the files are present, which triggers specific events in the visual novel.",
      "Each CHR file stores different information and can be opened with a program that supports the information contained in the file. For example, the monika.chr file is actually a .PNG file that can be opened with an image editor that supports PNG files."

      "CHR files are not intended for manual opening or editing by users. Instead, they serve as configuration files that Windows programs, particularly those that interact with system fonts, can access when necessary. These programs load CHR files to retrieve information about how specific fonts should be displayed, including details about their size, style and other attributes. Users typically do not need to interact directly with CHR files, as font management is handled by operating system and software applications."
