      "The KKK Virus is highly dangerous malware and is commonly referred to as ransomware. The purpose of the virus is to take your files hostage and force you to pay the perpetrator to unlock your files. The virus is a trojan horse that may be disguised as an Adobe Flash Player or java update or as an email message attachment. Once the virus affects your computer it begins scrambling your files, renaming them, and encrypting them. The virus then generates a ransom note informing you of the takeover and what you are meant to do to recover your files."
