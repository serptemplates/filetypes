      "_XLSX files are almost always renamed XLSX files. Most commonly, email programs such as Windows Live Mail mistakenly produce _XLSX files. This happens when a user attaches a spreadsheet whose filename ends in . to an email.",
      "For example, if you attach a spreadsheet named spreadsheet..xlsx to an email, Windows Live Mail will rename that file to spreadsheet._xlsx. This issue also occurs when users attach .DOC, .DOCX, and .XLS files to emails.",
      "While XLSX, and thus _XLSX, files are typically created by Microsoft Excel, they can also be created using other spreadsheet programs, such as OpenOffice Calc or Apple Numbers. After renaming your _XLSX file to use the .xlsx extension, you should be able to open the file in any of those programs."
