      "The mobile version of CyberLink PowerDirector allows Android and iOS tablet users to combine video, audio, images, and other elements into polished movies. PowerDirector for mobile features a streamlined user interface designed specifically for tablets, does not include all the features that PowerDirector for PC includes, and saves users' video editing projects as PDRPROJ files, instead of .PDS files.",
      "Though they are used to open video editing projects in PowerDirector for mobile, PDRPROJ files do not actually contain any video, audio, or image assets. Instead, they contain text-based references to the locations at which assets are stored. If you move an asset used in a PowerDirector for mobile project, your PDRPROJ file may not open correctly in PowerDirector for mobile.",
      "After a user has finished editing their video in PowerDirector for mobile, they can share the video on Facebook or YouTube, export the video as an .MP4 file, or upload their video project (and its assets) to the CyberLink Cloud. Users who upload their PDRPROJ files to the CyberLink Cloud can import those files into PowerDirector for Windows and macOS, to take advantage of that application's more advanced editing tools."
