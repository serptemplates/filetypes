      "Some commercial software applications require users to buy a license to use the application or access advanced features. After a user purchases a license, they may be sent an LF file. The LF file contains the user's licensing credentials, which the application references to confirm the user's purchase.",
      "LF files are used by applications that are licensed using SoftwareKey System, which is a licensing suite developers can use to streamline their app's licensing process. Instead of creating and maintaining their own app licensing system, developers can integrate their app with SoftwareKey System and let that application handle creating and verifying user's licenses.",
      "The LF files that SoftwareKey System produces are typically encrypted. However, in both their encrypted and decrypted forms, LF files contain XML-formatted text that defines a user's licensing credentials."
