      "A PRC file has one main header section followed by one or more file structures followed by one model file at the end. A file structure has one header followed by the following data sections:\n\nGlobals: It contains the referenced file structures and colors, line styles, and coordinate systems for each tree entity of the file structure.Tree: It contains a description of the tree of items like product occurrences, part definitions, representation items, and markup.Tessellation: It contains all the tessellated(triangulated) data in the leaf entities of the tree(representation items and markups).Geometry: It contains all exact geometry and topology data of the leaf entities of the tree(representation items).Extra geometry: It contains the summary data of the geometry. This allows the file to be partially loaded without loading the entire geometry.\n\nThe following is the structure of a typical PRC file.\n\nPRC Header File Structure #1 - Header for File Structure #1 - Globals for File Structure #1 - Tree for File Structure #1 - Tessellation for File Structure #1 - Geometry for File Structure #1 - Extra Geometry for File Structure #1 File Structure #2 ...

      "The MobiPocket PRC file format is based on the Open eBook standard using XHTML and also it can include JavaScript and frames. Support for native SQL queries to be used with embedded databases is also available.\n\nThe Mobipocket Reader has a home page library. Readers can insert blank pages in any part of a book and add variable drawings. The objects like Annotations, bookmarks, corrections, notes, and drawings are manageable from a single location. Images are converted to GIF format and have a maximum size of 64K which is sufficient for mobile phones with small screens. Mobipocket Reader has the electronic bookmarks, and a built-in dictionary.\n\nThe reader has a full screen mode for reading and support for many PDAs, Communicators, and Smartphones. The Mobipocket products support most Palm operating systems, Windows, Symbian, BlackBerry, but not the Android. The reader works under Linux or Mac OS X using WINE.",
      "Adobe Systems developed the PRC file format to allow engineers, architects, and other CAD software users to more easily share 3D models with each other, as part of PDF-based documentation workflows. Each PRC file contains a product's structure, geometry, and product manufacturing information (PMI).",
      "Adobe Acrobat Pro Extended 8 and 9 and Adobe Acrobat 3D allowed users to create PRC files and embed them in PDF files. Current versions of Acrobat do not allow users to create new PRC files, but they can still open, view, and embed previously-created PRC files."
