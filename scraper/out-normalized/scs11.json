      "SCS11 files store descriptive information about each audio file that helps the live show audio engineer know what the sounds contain. SCS11 files can also store hotkey shortcuts that play certain sounds when triggered. This is useful for impromptu or commonly used sounds.",
      "NOTE: SCS11 files do not store actual audio data, but instead store references to the audio files. Therefore, you need to make sure to transfer all referenced audio files with the SCS11 file to successfully move the project to another computer."
