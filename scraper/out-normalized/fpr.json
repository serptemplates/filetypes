      "Audit Workbench is a graphical user interface that complements the Static Code Analyzer program. It is used by developers for analyzing source code of software projects such as a Java project or Visual Studio Build Integration, and uncovering any security vulnerabilities. When you run a source code scan in Audit Workbench, the Static Code Analyzer program scans and analyzes code and produces results, which are then saved in the FPR project file by Audit Workbench.",
      "Audit Workbench comes with a basic project template you can use to alter to fit your needs or you can create a new template from scratch. The program also comes with a guide wizard to refine scan results and filter issues to prepare for an audit.",
      "NOTE: Audit Workbench was originally developed by Fortify Software, now known as Fortify, before being integrated into HP Enterprise Security Products."
