      "Xaero's World Map is a Minecraft mod that adds a self-writing, full-screen map to the game, allowing players to view and navigate explored areas more effectively. As players move through the Minecraft world, Xaero's mod continuously creates or updates XAERO files (the files act as local map caches) to reflect newly explored areas. Additionally, the mod saves XAERO files locally in the player's Minecraft directory, usually within the mod's configuration or data folder (e.g., XaeroWorldMap/​)."
