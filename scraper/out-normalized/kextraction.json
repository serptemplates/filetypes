      "Keka is a macOS archiver that can compress and decompress various archive formats, including ZIP, 7Z, TAR, GZIP, BZIP2, and ISO. The utility can also split files into multiple archives and password-protect them.",
      "When you decompress any supported archive, Keka creates a KEXTRACTION file in the destination location to which the archive contents are being extracted. Because Keka typically extracts the contents of an archive quickly, you will most likely not notice the KEXTRACTION file since it is replaced by the contents being extracted."
