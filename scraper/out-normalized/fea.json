      "FEA files are typically found in UFO files, along with .PLIST, .GLIF, and .PNG files. The files should not be removed from UFO files and are commonly accessed when a program, such as FontForge, RoboFont, or Glyphs, opens the UFO file. However, if you need to manually view an FEA file, you can open it in a text editor since it is saved in plain text."
