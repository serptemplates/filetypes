      "SCB files allow users to enter the Product Key for Euro Truck Simulator 2 when they do not have access to the Internet. SCB files are created by the program when a user enters their Product Key and attempts to activate the program but the computer cannot reach the Euro Truck Simulator 2 activation servers. The SCB file is created and named activation.scb, then placed in the \"Euro Truck Simulator 2\" folder in the \"Documents\" folder.",
      "Users can transfer the SCB file to another computer via a storage device, such as a USB flash drive or CD, then upload it to the Euro Truck Simulator 2 activation page. If the page is unavailable, the user can also email the file to Euro Truck Simulator 2.",
      "NOTE: Euro Truck Simulator 2 is a vehicle simulation game in which players drive across Europe delivering important cargo."
