      "Opening BKF files can be challenging, as NTBackup is not available in later Windows versions like Windows Vista, 7, 8, or 10. However, several methods are available:\n\nOn older Windows systems (like Windows XP and Server 2003), the NTBackup Tool can open and restore BKF files directly.Microsoft provides an NTBackup Restore Utility for Windows Vista and later, enabling users to restore BKF files.Programs such as Stellar Phoenix BKF Recovery, Kernel for BKF, and SysTools BKF Recovery allow users to open and repair BKF files on newer Windows versions."
