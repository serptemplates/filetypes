      "The ZIPX format was introduced with WinZip 12.1 in May 2009 and includes metadata that indicates the file was created using an advanced compression method. This lets users know that the file must be decompressed with WinZip 12.1 or another compatible file compression utility, such as PeaZip or The Unarchiver.",
      "You may encounter ZIPX files in a variety of ways, such as when receiving compressed files via email or downloading compressed files from a website. You may also find ZIPX files when exploring backup files that have been compressed with ZIPX compression.",
      "You can create ZIPX archives with WinZip by selecting .zipx in the \"Create/Share\" ribbon, adding the file(s) you want to compress, then clicking the floppy disk \"Save\" icon or selecting File → Save."
