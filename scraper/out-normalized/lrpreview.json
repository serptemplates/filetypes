      "Lightroom creates different size previews of original images. If there is a 1:1 preview available, the file can then be recovered as a JPG file, which will offer the same resolution as the original image.",
      "The LRViewer application can directly browse previews and export them as JPG images. The \"Extract Cached Images\" plugin is only compatible with versions 2 and 4 of Adobe Lightroom.",
