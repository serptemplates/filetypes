      "Lazesoft Recovery Suite allows Windows users to perform several data backup and recovery tasks, including repairing boot errors, removing viruses, recovering Windows passwords, and backing up their data. When a Lazesoft Recovery Suite user backs up their system's data, the program saves the data in an LVI file. LVI files are stored on external media or drives, such as a CD, flash drive, or external hard drive, which users can insert or connect to their PC when they need to restore their system."

      "To use an LVI file to restore your Windows system, insert the media or connect the drive on which the LVI file is stored to your PC. Then, turn on your PC. If your PC does not automatically boot from the external media or device, edit your BIOS settings to boot from the media or device. Your computer should then boot from your LVI file, allowing you to restore your system."
