      "Samsung Smart Switch is the official backup app used to transfer a user's contacts, photos, settings, call history, and other data from one Samsung Galaxy phone to another. When creating a backup, Smart Switch creates several encrypted files, each of which contains a portion of the user's phone data. Smart Switch then stores the encrypted files in a Smart Switch/​Backup folder on the user's phone or PC.",
      "One of the files a Smart Switch backup contains is an SNMM file. This file contains a copy of the notes a user has created in Samsung Notes. However, the file is saved in a proprietary, non-human-readable format. Therefore, you cannot simply open the file to read or retrieve your notes."

      "The best way to retrieve the notes an SNMM file contains is to transfer the file to a Galaxy phone using Samsung Smart Switch (Android, Windows, Mac), as part of the normal Galaxy backup and restore process. After you do, the notes your SNMM file contains will appear in Samsung Notes."
