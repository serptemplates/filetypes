      "Because ZSH-THEME files are plain text files, you can open and examine them using any text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows), Apple TextEdit (Mac), or Github Atom (cross-platform). If you intend to edit a ZSH-THEME file, however, you should open it in a source code editor, such as Atom, Vim (Linux), or Microsoft Visual Studio Code (cross-platform). These programs will highlight the file's syntax correctly.",
      "To use a ZSH-THEME file as a zsh theme, you must install Oh My Zsh and set your .zshrc file's ZSH_THEME setting to the name of your ZSH-THEME file. You must also place the ZSH-THEME file in Oh My Zsh's themes directory. For more information on Oh My Zsh, click the Oh My Zsh program link found below."
