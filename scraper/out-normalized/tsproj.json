      "ToonSquid is a 2D digital animation app developed by Keiwan Donyagard. It allows animators to create layer-based animations, which can consist of animated drawings, colored backgrounds, audio clips, and videos.",
      "Animation projects created in ToonSquid are saved as TSPROJ files. When creating a new TSPROJ file, an animator can specify various project properties, such as the project's width, height, frames per second, and default workflow. All of a user's TSPROJ files appear on ToonSquid's Projects screen. From this screen, users can also export and import TSPROJ files."
