      "The Game Creators developed FPS Creator, targeting hobbyists, students, and independent developers who want to design FPS games without writing extensive amounts of code from scratch. The AI Wizard included with FPS Creator streamlines the process of defining enemy or ally behavior by allowing users to configure settings through a guided interface. FPID files store these wizard-generated configurations, which FPS Creator converts into executable FPI scripts that the game engine can interpret.",
