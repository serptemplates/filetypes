      "EWNET files are used for transferring a PCB layout to a schematic or a schematic to a layout. The EWNET file is created by the Multisim and Ultiboard programs included with the Circuit Design Suite. When you select Transfer → Transfer to Ultiboard in Multisim or Transfer → Backward Annotate to Multisim in Ultiboard. You can open an EWNET file by selecting File → Open.",
      "PCBs are used in many electronic products such as radios and computer systems. Ultiboard allows you to design the layout of electrical wires, central processors, and other electronic components on your PCB and integrates with Multisim, an electronic schematic capture and SPICE simulation environment. The program is used by teachers, students, and professionals in the engineering field."
