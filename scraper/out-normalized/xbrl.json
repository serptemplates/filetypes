      "The XBRL document is written in XML format but uses XBRL elements, such as tags that describe each item of business data for quicker report sorting and analysis. An easy-to-spot differentiation between XBRL and XML files is that the XBRL file has the element tag <xbrl> in its root.",
      "NOTE: In 2011, all public companies were mandated by the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to report earnings in the XBRL format."
