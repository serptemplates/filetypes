      "The SMPTE created the MXF format to streamline video exchange between platforms, including video cameras, digital editing equipment, and servers. The format adopts a subset of the Advanced Authoring Format (AAF), which standardized the interchange of video between multiple vendors and platforms. Like any other media container format, the appropriate codec must be available to play the media an MXF file contains."
