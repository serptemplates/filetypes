      "Call of Duty is a first-person shooter video game franchise where you play as soldiers in various battles ranging from World War 2 to modern warfare. Various Activision games use IWD files, but you will most likely encounter them in the CoD2 and CoD4 games from the 2000s. For example, you can find IWD files in the \\​Program Files\\​Activision\\​Call of Duty\\​main\\​ directory of the games."

      "However, since IWD files are Zip-compressed, you can open them and extract their contents with a Zip utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer (Windows), Apple Archive Utility (macOS), or Corel WinZip (Windows). However, you should not modify IWD files unless you know the correct changes to make. Altering an IWD file may make it unusable by Call of Duty."
