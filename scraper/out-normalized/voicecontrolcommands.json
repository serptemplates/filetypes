      "Apple Xcode and Fat Cat PlistEdit Pro also support VOICECONTROLCOMMANDS files if you transfer them from your iOS device to a Mac.",
      "Since VOICECONTROLCOMMANDS files are saved in plain text, you can also open them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (Mac). You may need to rename the file extension to .txt for the text editor to recognize it.",
      "When opened, you can modify the properties of the file. Remember that if you incorrectly edit the file, you may inadvertently break the commands."
