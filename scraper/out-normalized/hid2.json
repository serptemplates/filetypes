      "When you choose a video or image to be hidden, KeepSafe appends a string of numbers preceding the filename and the HID2 extension on to the end of the file. The extension hides the file from being recognized as what it really is, like a .JPG file, and prevents other applications on the device from recognizing the file.",
      "For example, KeepSafe may save an image file as 1543305784357378655.IMG_1549.JPG.HID2. The \"1543305784357378655\" is a random string of numbers generated by KeepSafe and \"HID2\" is the extension added by the program.",
      "NOTE: The HID2 extension was replaced by the .KSD extension in 2013."
