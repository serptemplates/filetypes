      "The H.263 video compression standard was created and is maintained by the International Telegraph Union (ITU), a division of the United Nations that coordinates the world's response to information and communication technology issues. The standard was created in 1996 and last updated in 2005. It was designed to be used by videoconferencing applications and systems. If you've stumbled upon an H263 file, it was likely recorded using a videoconferencing program created in the 1990s."
