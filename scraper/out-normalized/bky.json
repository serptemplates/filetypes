      "You will most likely only encounter a BKY file if you download an AIA project file from the App Inventor online tool, extract the contents with a Zip-decompression utility, and open the \"src\" folder within the contents. Since the BKY file stores plain text, you can open and edit it with any text editor.",
      "App Inventor is designed for beginning developers. It allows users to drag and drop elements, such as buttons, images, text boxes, and sliders, into an application to create the user interface and functionality of the app. Kodular Creator, which derives from App Inventor, may also create BKY files in the AIA project files."
