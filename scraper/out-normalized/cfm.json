      "You will most likely encounter CFM files only if you are a web developer and integrating ColdFusion functionality into your webpages. Developers typically use Adobe ColdFusion Builder for creating applications in CFML. However, they may use a variety of other CFML IDEs and editors, such as Adobe Dreamweaver, CFEclipse (plug-in for Eclipse), and CFBrackets (extension for the Brackets source code editor).",
