      "In Descent 2, players pilot a spaceship through a series of missions in which they must destroy planetary mines that have been infected by an alien computer virus. The game is so popular that a robust modding community has created many utilities used to modify and create custom content for the game. Some of these utilities can be used to create customized game levels.",
      "While creating a custom level, modders can modify the properties of game weapons, objects, and enemies. These modifications are saved in HXM files. The modifications that HXM files contain overwrite the default properties stored in Descent 2 .HAM files (both default and custom HAM files)."
