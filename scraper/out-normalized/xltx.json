      "Excel is the most widely-used spreadsheet application in the world. It comes with every edition of the Microsoft Office suite and is designed for home, academic, and business environments.",

You can also create custom templates from your spreadsheets. To save a spreadsheet as an XLTX file with Microsoft Excel, select File →Save As, then choose \"Excel Template\" from the format dropdown menu.",
