      "Animation enthusiasts use Plotagon Studio to create, edit, and publish 3D animated movies. Plotagon Studio movies typically include animated scenes, subtitles, and spoken dialogue.",
      "In the past, Plotagon created PLOTDOC files and stored the files in users' C:/​Users/​AppData/​LocalLow/​Plotagon/​Plotagon directory. PLOTDOC files were JSON-formatted text files that described a Plotagon project. They listed a project's ID, name, created on date, and last updated date, before describing the project itself.",
      "When Plotagon became Plotagon Studio, PLOTDOC files were replaced by PLOT files, which are binary files that contain Plotagon Studio projects. It appears that PLOT files contain PLOTDOC files, but users can no longer access Plotagon Studio's PLOTDOC files themselves."
