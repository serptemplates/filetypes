      "You can open RAF files with Fujifilm image-viewing and -editing software, such as X RAW STUDIO and RAW FILE CONVERTER EX (developed for Fujifilm by Ichikawa Soft Laboratory). Fujifilm software is typically the best option for opening RAF files because it likely supports all the camera models that capture the RAF images.",
      "Third-party image viewers and editors also support RAF files, but they may not support all the camera models that capture the images. For example, Adobe Photoshop (multiplatform) can open RAF files through its Camera Raw utility but does not support RAF images captured by all Fujifilm cameras. It also does not open all the multiple images saved in HDR RAF format (only one image).",
      "Other third-party apps that can open RAF files include Microsoft Photos (Windows) with the Raw Image Extension installed, and Apple Preview and Apple Photos, which both come bundled with macOS. If you are a mobile user, you can open RAF files with Adobe Photoshop Express (Android and iOS)."
