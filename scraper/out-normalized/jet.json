      "The Jackbox Party Pack is a series of video games that each include a set of party games. For example, The Jackbox Party Pack 2 includes five party games: Fibbage 2, Earwax, Bidiots, Quiplash XL, and Bomb Corp.",

      "Each party game's data includes one or more JET settings files. These files determine, for example, what text and what media files are shown at certain points in the game. All JET files are plain text files, which modders can edit to modify what text, images, and sounds appear in a game."
