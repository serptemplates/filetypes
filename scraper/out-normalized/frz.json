      "Video game console emulators allow you to play console games on your PC. If you want to save your progress while playing a game in Snes9x, you can do so by selecting File → Save Game Position from the program's menu bar. This saves your current game state as an FRZ file.",
      "It is also possible to produce FRZ files without Snes9x. For example, Wii gamers who use Snes9xGX to play SNES games on their Wii consoles can save FRZ files, which can be transferred to the PC version of Snes9x.",
