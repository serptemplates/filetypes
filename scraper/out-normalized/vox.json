      "This type of file format is compatible with Windows OS programs such as Xentec Vox Studio. It has specific features that are used to stimulate the speech of humans. Arcade games mostly use this format. The VOX file extension has a 32-byte header along with 10-byte indices and frames. The actual voice data is saved in frames in the form of segments in a single file. There is a different form of several bytes in each frame based on the type of encoding.\n\nThe clarify of voice is maintained at a low sampling rate which is rare in most audio formats. The algorithm used in these was mathematical.\n\nThis file is encoded by the use of ADPCM. It shorts the 16-bit audio data and 4-bit compression. So there is an advantage of saving bigger-sized audio information in a compact form using VOX files.",
      "The Voxlap engine was created by Ken Silverman and is available freely. It has been used for creating games such as Ace of Spades, which uses .KV6 files that are based on the VOX format.",
      "NOTE: A voxel (which stands for \"volumetric pixel\") is a pixel represented as a cube in 3D space. Therefore, voxel models look like they have been built with LEGO blocks when rendered. The Voxlap VOX format is one of many different voxel formats."
