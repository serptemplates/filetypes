      "A new ‘ds64’ chunk is immediately inserted (before the FMT chunk), after the 32-bit chunk size field at offset 4 is set to -1 (0xFFFFFFFF) in RF64 simplest form. By using a simple sequential table mechanism, the DS64 chunk will contain the data chunk(s), pointing to additional DATA chunks. The first 4 bytes of the file are then being changed from ‘RIFF’ to ‘BW64’.\n\nAdditional chunks defined by RF64 files include:\n\nBW64 : Replacing “RIFF”ds64 : 64-bit data size, first chunk under BW64axml : Replaced by BW64bxml : Similar to “axml” in BWF (ITU-R BS.1352-3), but it is compressedsxml : XML data related to soundchna : Info of the channelJUNK : ds64 placeholder"
