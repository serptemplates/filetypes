      "The \".crypt6\" extension is appended to .DB files used by WhatsApp to secure users' message databases on Android devices. The unencrypted database appears as msgstore.db, but the database encrypted in the CRYPT6 format appears as msgstore.db.crypt6. The application uses different algorithms to encrypt DB files. The extension appended to the DB file, such as \".crypt5\" or \".crypt7\", signifies the algorithm."
