      "Both Salvat AudioCuentos and Märchenheld offer a series of children's audiobooks that are played by placing a figurine atop a square, blue audio player (sometimes referred to as an audio cube). The audio player contains a memory card that stores a number of SMP files, each of which contains an audiobook. When a child places a figurine atop the audio player, the player loads and plays that figurine's associated SMP file.",
      "In most circumstances, those who use AudioCuentos and Märchenheld audiobooks should never have to encounter or manually open an SMP file. The only way you would encounter an SMP file is if you removed the memory card from an AudioCuentos or Märchenheld audio player and connected it to your computer."

      "You cannot open or play an SMP audiobook file on a computer or mobile device. You can, however, convert an SMP file to an MP3 file using audiocube.py (cross-platform) or SMP2MP3 (Windows). Then, you can play the MP3 file in most media players.",
      "The only way to natively play an SMP file is to place it on a memory card, place the memory card within an AudioCuentos or Märchenheld audio player, and then place the SMP file's associated figurine atop the player."
