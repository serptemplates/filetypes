      "Mozilla browsers, including Firefox, support XUL to build both the main browser interface and add-ons or extensions. Because XUL is based on XML, it is both human-readable and machine-readable, making it easier for developers to create and modify interfaces.",
      "XUL files work together with other technologies, such as JavaScript and CSS, to provide interactive and styled user experiences. For example, CSS applies styling to elements defined in an XUL file (e.g., colors, fonts, and sizes), and JavaScript adds interactivity and dynamic behavior to them (e.g., click response or fetching and displaying data without reloading the interface).",
      "Users who interact with XUL files are mostly software developers and extension creators who work on customizing Mozilla-based browsers or building standalone applications that rely on the Gecko rendering engine. While most users don't directly open or edit XUL files, these files are essential for determining the software's appearance and functionality."
