      "UZED files are primarily used by version 7 of MyHeritage Family Tree Builder. They replaced .ZED files, which are used by versions 1 - 6 of the software.",
      "UZED files are similar to ZED files but instead of storing only a Zip-compressed GEDCOM file, it also includes a metadata.xml file that stores metadata about the family tree. Also, the GEDCOM file compressed in the UZED archive stores Unicode UTF-8-encoded text instead of ANSI-encoded text, which the GEDCOM file in the ZED archive utilizes.",
      "ZED and UZED files are often referred to as being saved in the ZEDCOM (Zipped-GEDCOM) format. The files were replaced by .FTB SQLite database files with the release of version 8 of MyHeritage Family Tree Builder."
