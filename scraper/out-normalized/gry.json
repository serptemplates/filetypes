      "The images that GRY files contain are not camera raw files. In this case, raw refers not to the fact that an image is unprocessed (like a camera raw image), but the fact that the image's data is unstructured (it contains no header or footer, is uncompressed, and does not use a color palette). Because GRY files contain raw image data, many programs cannot display the images they contain unless you provide accompanying metadata."
