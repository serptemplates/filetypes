      "eDrawings Publisher works with popular CAD programs like SolidWorks, AutoCAD, CATIA, Autodesk Inventor, and Trimble SketchUp, allowing users to export models in the eDrawings format. EDRW files are compressed and optimized for easy sharing, especially with collaborators who don't have access to the original CAD software.",
      "EDRW files are designed specifically for eDrawings Viewer (also known simply as \"eDrawings\"), a free application for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. The EDRW is read-only (users cannot edit it), making it a good option for securely distributing technical drawings for review and presentation.",
