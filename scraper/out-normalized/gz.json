      "Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler initially developed the Gzip format and released the gzip program on October 31, 1992. Today, the format and program are still used in Unix systems to reduce file sizes for transportation or storage purposes. Also, GNU Project now develops gzip.",
      "GZ files often store .TAR archives that contain multiple files, such as video, image, audio, and backup files. TAR files compressed with gzip compression typically have a .tar.gz or .tgz file extension and are known as \"tarballs.\" You must first decompress these files then expand them with a TAR utility."
