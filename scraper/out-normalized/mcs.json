      "While the format is no longer developed, Mathcad used MCS files to save and reuse visual content within technical documents. Engineers, scientists, and students used these images to illustrate calculations or present data visually. The format allows users to capture and store Mathcad-generated graphics separately from the main worksheet, making it easier to include them in reports or other documents.",
