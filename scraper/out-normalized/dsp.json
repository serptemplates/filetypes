      "Dynamic Studio Professional allowed musicians to compose songs by arranging audio samples in a grid-like interface, defining each sound's pitch, effects, and timing. The software was prevalent in the demoscene and video game development communities for its capabilities in creating multi-channel, sample-based music that worked efficiently on their limited hardware (mainly DOS-based PCs). While Dynamic Studio Professional is no longer actively developed and the DSP format has become obscure, retro audio enthusiasts may still use DSP files."
