      "IP cameras are able to send and receive data through the Internet. They are similar to webcams but are used for the purpose of surveillance, such as checking in on senior citizens, pets, and babies. The IPROBOT3 network camera records video and saves it as a V264 file.",
      "NOTE: Unfortunately, the v264 video format is not widely supported making it difficult to view V264 files with programs other than the V264Player."
