      "Game designers and hobbyists who build FPS games with FPS Creator are the primary users of FPI files. The program reads FPI files to determine the logic that drives non-playable characters (NPCs) and other interactive objects within a game. This allows creators to design varied gameplay experiences by assigning different scripts to various characters or objects."
