      "All EasySignCut Pro users are familiar with the ESC file since it is the primary file created by the program. EasySignCut Pro saves all the contents of your design in the file and allows you to close the file and reopen it for further editing.",
      "You can import a variety of image formats into an ESC project, such as .SVG or .SVGZ, .PNG, .EPS, .AI, and .DXF. You can also trace images and choose from many shapes in the EasySignCut library.",
      "You can export an ESC file to other formats for sharing and printing purposes. They can be exported to .SVG, .BMP, .JPG, .PNG, .TIFF, .PLT, and FCM files."
