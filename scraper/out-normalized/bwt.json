      "When you create a copy of a disc in BlindWrite 4.x, the application typically creates 3 files. Along with the BWT file, the BWI Disk Image file and .BWS Sub Code file are created. The BWI file contains the actual disc image and is large in size. The BWS file contains sub channel data for the disc image and is much smaller. However, the BWS file is optional.",
      "BWT files were replaced with .B5T files when version 5 of BlindWrite was released. B5T files were then replaced by .B6T files with the release of BlindWrite 6.",
      "NOTE: BlindWrite replaced allows you copy a CD, DVD, Blu-ray, or game and burn the contents to another CD, DVD, or Blu-ray."
