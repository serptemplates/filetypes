      "Microsoft Outlook's \"Notes\" view can be used to view PWI files when syncing with a Windows Mobile device. Make sure synchronization is turned on for notes, then sync with Windows Mobile Device Center (WMDC), and then view the notes in Outlook. Microsoft ActiveSync was formerly used to open PWI files in conjunction with Microsoft Word. The ActiveSync installation provided a plug-in for Word that allowed Word to open the documents. However, with the release of WMDC, PWI support is no longer provided.",
      "Some PWI files can be opened on a PC with Microsoft Word. However, the ink data may not display correctly. Microsoft OneNote 2003 can read handwritten notes and text in PWI files. Some older versions of Microsoft Works can open Pocket Word documents, including Works 7.0.",
      "NOTE: PWI files are also referred to as InkWriter/Note Taker documents."
