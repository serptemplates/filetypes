For example, to access a SAS7BDAT file located at C:/​Documents/​example.sas7bdat, you would enter libname examplerefname C:/Documents/example.sas7bdat in your SAS session. You could then access the dataset by referring to it as examplerefname. For more detailed instructions, refer to SAS's official documentation."
