      "Using GB Studio, Game Boy enthusiasts can develop and publish their own Game Boy games. When a developer saves their game development project, GB Studio creates a project-specific directory. This directory contains all the project's assets, a GBSPROJ file, and a GBSPROJ.BAK file (a backup of the GBSPROJ file).",
