      "UniChem is a computational chemistry software package widely used in the 1990s for drug discovery and chemical analysis tasks but is no longer developed. It enabled researchers and scientists to simulate molecular interactions and conduct structure-activity relationship studies, helping accelerate product development in several fields, including pharmaceuticals and materials science. As users performed various chemical analysis tasks with UniChem, the software saved their results in NVL files, which users could then review."
