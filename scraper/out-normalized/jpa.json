      "The JPA format was designed to create archives of large directory trees only using PHP code. It can also be used as an alternative to the popular .ZIP file format. Unlike the ZIP format, JPA does not store a checksum for each file, which reduces the processing overhead when archiving. This feature helps make the JPA format faster and use less resources during the archiving process.",
      "NOTE: Multi-part Akeeba backup archives use the JPA, .J01, J02, and .JPS extensions."
