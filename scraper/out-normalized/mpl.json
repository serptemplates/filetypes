      "You will most likely only encounter an MPL file if you own a Sony AVCHD digital camcorder and transferred the MPL file to your computer. The files are referenced by the camcorder that created them for the purpose of video file navigation and playback. However, MPL files may be opened by various multimedia programs, such as Roxio Creator, Roxio Toast, and Cyberlink PowerDVD.",
