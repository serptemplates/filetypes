      "The W3C Music Notation Community developed the open MusicXML standard for musicians and composers to more easily share sheet music between applications and archive sheet music for future use or preservation. The format is so common that most music notation applications support it.",

      "Since MUSICXML files are saved in plain text, you can also open them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, or a source code editor. You may need to rename the .musicxml file extension to .txt for the text editor to recognize it.",
      "When opened in a text editor or source code editor, you can modify the properties of the MUSICXML file. However, if you incorrectly edit the file, you may not be able to open the file correctly with an application that natively supports it."
