      "VMS/VAX systems were standard in the 1980s and 1990s, and Digital Equipment Corporation renamed VMS/VAX to OpenVMS in 1992. The system was eventually deprecated, making HLB files largely obscure. However, some organizations still use OpenVMS, and users needing technical assistance with OpenVMS may still access HLB files."
