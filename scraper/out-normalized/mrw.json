      "Many professional-grade digital cameras save photos as camera raw files. These files contain all the data captured when a photographer took a picture. Retaining this data in its raw form allows photographers to edit elements of the image, such as its color temperature and exposure, more precisely than they'd be able to if the data was processed or compressed.",
      "Minolta Dimage cameras, such as the Dimage 7 and Dimage Z2, save camera raw images as MRW files. When Sony acquired Minolta, they phased out the MRW format and replaced it with the .ARW format."

      "You can use Adobe Photoshop, Logipole Konvertor, or XnViewMP to convert MRW files to other image formats. For example, XnViewMP can convert MRW files to the following formats (and many others):",
      ".JPEG - JPEG Image",
      ".GIF - Graphical Interchange Format",
      ".PNG - Portable Network Graphic",
      ".TIFF - Tagged Image",
      ".BMP - Bitmap Image",
      ".PCX - Paintbrush Bitmap Image",
      ".TGA - Targa Graphic",
      ".JP2 - JPEG 2000 Core Image",
      ".JXR - JPEG XR Image",
      ".WEBP - WebP Image",
      "Keep in mind that converting an MRW file to a non-raw format will remove the raw data it contains. Therefore, you may want to keep a copy of your MRW file for future editing."
