      "Musicians and producers use MTI files to save and reuse custom instruments in their compositions. This allows for consistent sound across different projects without reloading or adjusting settings manually each time.",
      "While MadTracker was widely used in the early 2000s, its popularity has declined, and modern digital audio workstations (DAWs) now offer more advanced instrument formats. However, those working with older projects or exploring tracker-based music production may still use MTI files.",
