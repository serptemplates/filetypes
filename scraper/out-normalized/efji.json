      "In October 2020, some users reported their computers had been infected by EFJI ransomware. This ransomware is a variant of the popular .STOP family of ransomware.",
      "Just like other STOP variants, EFJI ransomware encrypts a user's files (to prevent the user from opening them) and renames the files it encrypts. It then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. This ransom note contains instructions users can supposedly follow to restore their files.",
      "EFJI ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by EFJI ransomware."

      "Because EFJI files are encrypted, you cannot open them. At this time, there is no way to decrypt EFJI files. The best way to restore files encrypted by EFJI ransomware is to retrieve them from a recent backup or perform a System Restore."
