      "SNS files are rare. You will likely only encounter them if you are attempting to modify the gameplay of a game that uses the file type to store its sound effects and music. For example, a gamer playing Burnout Paradise may navigate the game's resource files (stored in the game installation directory) and modify SNS files to alter the sounds and music played in the game. Additionally, examples of codecs used to encode data in an SNS file include EALayer3 or EA XAS ADPCM.",
