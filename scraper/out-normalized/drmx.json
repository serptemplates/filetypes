      "Drumlin Security develops both Drumlin PDF Reader/Publisher and Javelin PDF Reader. The Drumlin PDF Reader/Publisher software converts .PDF files to the secure DRMX or DRMZ formats. Javelin PDF Reader enables any PDF file, such as a book, report, or manual to be distributed securely to anyone, anywhere in the world.",
      "A DRMX file can be used to create a Javelin “Click and Go” .EXE file using the File Menu → Publish → Create EXE option.",
