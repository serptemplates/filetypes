      "Twitter is a social media service where users can post tweets that contain text, images, and videos. The service re-sizes images uploaded by users and hosted on its media server with a JSON entity size specification based on how users view the image in a web browser.",
      "For example, if a user is viewing an image in its medium size, Twitter appends the medium specification to the image's URL when opening it, creating a URL that ends in .jpg:medium. In some cases, when a Google Chrome user accesses a medium-sized image stored on Twitter's media server in a new tab, Chrome accesses the image at a URL that looks like this:",
      "https:/​/​pbs.twimg.com/​media/​FHtahgTXEAkr9EM.jpg:medium",
      "If the user downloads the image from this page, Chrome saves the image with the .jpg_medium file extension instead of .jpg:medium because colons cannot be present in filenames.",
      "Twitter may display images in sizes other than medium, including thumbnail, small, and large. In these cases, Chrome users downloading images in these sizes may encounter .JPG_THUMB, .JPG_SMALL, and .JPG_LARGE files.",
      "NOTE: To prevent the creation of JPG_MEDIUM files, Twitter now uses the following URL structure: https:/​/​pbs.twimg.com/​media/​FIggzS3VkAEmqzW?format=jpg&name=medium"

      "Image viewers and web browsers that support JPEG images, such as Adobe Photoshop (cross-platform) and Google Chrome (cross-platform), will also open JPG_MEDIUM files. However, some of these applications may not recognize the .jpg_medium extension.",
      "If your application supports JPEG images but won't open a JPG_MEDIUM file, change the file extension to .jpg and open it with the application. Changing the file's extension will not alter its contents."
