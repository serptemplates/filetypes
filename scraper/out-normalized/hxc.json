      "Microsoft Help 2 (also referred to as Microsoft Help 2.x) was a help engine used by Microsoft Visual Studio 2002 to 2008, Microsoft Office 2007, and Microsoft Office 2010. To create Help 2 content, developers used help authoring programs such as Help 2 Workshop. Help projects created using these programs stored their metadata in HXC files.",
      "Each HXC file contains XML-formatted information that defines a project's contents, organization, and other information. After a developer finished creating their Help 2 project, they could use their HXC file to build a compiled .HXS file, used to actually deliver help content to users.",
