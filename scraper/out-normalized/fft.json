      "Adobe Audition is a digital audio workstation (DAW) for producing professional audio productions, such as song tracks, podcasts, and video audio. It has various tools for creating, mixing, designing, and restoring audio with an advanced toolset. For example, one of the tools is the ability to reduce background and broadband noise on a track.",
      "To apply the noise reduction effect:",
      "Choose a range containing only noise (and at least a half second long) in the Waveform Editor",
      "Select Effects → Noise Reduction / Restoration → Capture Noise Print",
      "Choose the range you want to remove the noise from in the Editor panel",
      "Select Effects → Noise Reduction / Restoration → Noise Reduction (process)",
      "In the \"Effect - Noise Reduction\" window, you can choose Capture Noise Print, which saves a noise profile from the selected range so Audition can remove similar noise from the rest of the waveform. You can also save the noise print as an FFT file. To save a selected noise print as an FFT file, click the Save the current noise print option (save-to-disk icon) next to the Capture Noise Print option."
