      "Jakarta Server Pages is a standard and set of technologies that developers use to create dynamically-generated webpages. Developers write these webpages using Java code, as well as HTML and XML syntax.",
      "JSP files typically contain only Java and HTML content. Any web server that includes a JSP-compatible servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Jetty, can render a JSP file as a webpage in users' web browsers.",
      "However, were a user to view a processed JSP webpage's source code in their browser, the user would see only HTML code. When a web server processes a JSP file, it dynamically translates the Java code the file contains into HTML. The user's web browser then renders this fully-HTML version of the webpage.",
