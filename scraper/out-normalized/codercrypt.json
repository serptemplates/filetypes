      "You may be able to decrypt and open files encrypted by the Android version of CoderWare ransomware. The files are encrypted with the RC4 symmetric encryption algorithm, which means you can use the same key to decrypt your files as the key used to encrypt your files.",
      "You can find the key embedded into the source code of the fake mobile app that distributed the malware. Once you retrieve the key, you can use an RC4 decryption tool to decrypt your files. You can also contact an antivirus company, like Kaspersky or Malwarebytes for support.",
      "NOTE: Back up your encrypted files if any data corruption occurs during the decryption process."
