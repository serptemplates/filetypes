      "SimplySync Backup is a program that allows Windows users to create copies of their files and store those copies on a separate hard drive or server. After a user specifies what files they want to back up and where the backups should be stored, they can save those settings in a SALL file. The user can then load their SALL file in SimplySync Backup to perform the same backup operation again at a later time, such as after the user has added or edited files stored in a backed-up folder.",
      "While SALL files are used to perform backup operations, they do not contain any backed-up files or data. They contain only the settings used to create backups. As such, you cannot use a SALL file to restore backed-up data. You can, however, open your SALL file in SimplySync Backup and use the file as a reference if you've forgotten where you saved your backups."
