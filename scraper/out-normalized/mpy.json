      "MicroPython is a Python implementation that is optimized to run programs on a microcontroller. It contains a cross-compiler, known as mpy-cross, which is used to pre-compile Python scripts to MPY files. These bytecode files are meant to be included in a microcontroller's firmware, so they are available to MicroPython programs run on that microcontroller.",
      "Some MPY files may contain machine code compiled from programs written in a language other than Python. These files are used to import non-Python libraries and functions into MicroPython programs. Non-Python MPY files are created using MicroPython's mpy_ld.py tool, which links together and compiles a set of .O files."
