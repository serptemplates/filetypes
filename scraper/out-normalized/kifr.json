      "KIFR ransomware first appeared in April 2023. It is one of many variants of .STOP ransomware, which various cybercriminals use to attack users' computers and maliciously encrypt their files.",
      "After encrypting a user's files, KIFR ransomware produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. In theory, this ransom note contains instructions users can follow to pay a ransom and decrypt their files. However, ransomware distributors are not trustworthy, and therefore you should not pay a ransom to decrypt your files.",
      "KIFR ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by KIFR ransomware."

      "Because KIFR files are encrypted, you cannot open them. At this time, there is no way to decrypt KIFR files. The best way to restore files encrypted by KIFR ransomware is to retrieve them from a recent backup or perform a System Restore."
