      "Sun Microsystems was a computer and software company that was founded in 1982 and bought by Oracle in 2010. The company included a proprietary operating system, SunOS, on the workstations and servers it sold.",
      "Systems that ran SunOS often saved raster images in the Sun Raster Graphic format. These images could be compressed or uncompressed, and they could be grayscale, paletted, or full-color images. Each SUN file includes a fixed 32-byte header, which begins with a magic number (59a66a95) that identifies the file as a Sun Raster Graphic.",
      "NOTE: Sun Raster Graphics also use the .RAS, .RS, and .SR extensions."
