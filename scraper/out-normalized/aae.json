      "AAE files are created by the Photos app in iOS 8 and later and macOS 10.10 and later. The files save edits made in Photos, so users' original images are not overwritten when edited.",
      "When you open an edited .JPG file in Photos, the app references the JPG's associated AAE file and applies any edits it contains. The AAE file's data is saved in the XML format, which means the files can be opened and viewed with a text editor, such as Apple TextEdit or Microsoft Notepad.",
      "If you import pictures edited using the Photos app to Windows or an older version of macOS, you will most likely notice AAE files accompanying your images. In Windows, the .aae extension may be hidden by default, but the AAE files bear the same name as the JPG files whose edits they contain. After you import your pictures into Windows, you can delete the pictures' AAE files without erasing the associated pictures."
