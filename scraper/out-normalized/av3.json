      "AV3 files are typically used for storing video recorded by the Arbitrator BWC 3 body camera worn by police officers. The footage is used for evidence for criminal cases that go to court. Since footage must be secured to prevent any tampering, AV3 files can only be opened using Panasonic SafeServ, which is part of the Unified Evidence Management System (UEMS) from Panasonic.",
