      "Verizon Messages, which was previously named Verizon Message+, is a texting and group chat app that Verizon wireless users can install on their smartphones, tablets, and computers. If a user wants to save a record of the messages they've sent and received through Verizon Messages, they can do so by tapping a conversation, selecting the messages they want to save, and selecting the Download icon. This will create a VZM file that contains a record of the selected messages.",
      "Most often, VZM files are used as message backup files. For example, a user who is switching phones may use their VZM file to restore their previous messages in a new instance of Verizon Messages."

Before attempting to open your VZM file in a text editor, you may want to rename it to use the .XML extension, so the text editor recognizes the file as an XML file.",
