      "SFD files can be converted to .MPG files using a utility called sfd2mpg, which is part of the SFD Tool Pack by SWAT. However, this utility was not widely distributed and no longer is under development. SFD files can be created using Sega's Movie Creator application, but it is also no longer being developed and was last released in 1999. The SFD Tool Pack by SWAT includes this program.",
