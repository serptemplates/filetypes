To play the game packaged in the LOVE file end-users only need to install the free LÖVE program on their computer.",
      "To create a LOVE file, first create the main.lua file and other game resources, then compress them into a .ZIP file and rename the file extension from .zip to .love. Make sure the main.lua file is in the top-most directory level of the Zip archive."
