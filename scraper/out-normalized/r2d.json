      "Borland Reflex is an obsolete database management program that was available for DOS PCs. Reflex saved database files in a variety of file formats, including R2D. While many database and spreadsheet management programs could previously open R2D files, no currently developed programs natively support the R2D file format. However, you may be able to open your R2D file in a current spreadsheet program by renaming it to use the .TXT extension."
