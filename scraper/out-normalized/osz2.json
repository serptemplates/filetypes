      "osu! allows players to create their own custom levels, which can include custom audio, graphics, and prompts. Typically, these levels are saved as OSZ files. However, when a player submits their custom level to osu!'s website, the level is submitted as an OSZ2 file. The game also saves a local copy of these files.",
      "Unlike OSZ files, OSZ2 files are not Zip-compressed files. This prevents players from decompressing the files and editing their contents. OSZ2 levels can be edited only in osu!, and not via File Explorer and other non-osu! applications.",
      "At one point, it was thought that the OSZ2 format would become osu!'s primary beatmap format. However, players seem to prefer the OSZ format, as they enjoy the ability to edit levels outside osu!."
