      "Future Crew developed the first version of Scream Tracker in the late-1980s to modify the popular .MOD Amiga Module format introduced in 1987. Future Crew then released version 2 of Scream Tracker in 1990.",
      "The STM format is the default format that Scream Tracker 1 and 2 use to save music. However, future Crew eventually replaced the STM format with the Scream Tracker 3 Module (S3M) format when it released Scream Tracker 3 in 1994.",
      "Even though Future Crew discontinued Scream Tracker in the 1990s, you may still encounter old STM files created by the original application. You may also acquire STM files created by music enthusiasts using a third-party application that supports the STM format."
