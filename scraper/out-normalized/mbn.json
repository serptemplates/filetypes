      "A bootloader is a program executed before an operating system begins to run, whether it be on your computer, smartphone, or other device. It checks and verifies software on your device before it loads. Each Android phone has a bootloader that instructs the operating system kernel to boot normally. In order to install custom firmware on your Android device, the bootloader needs to be unlocked.",
