      "FEV files contain the audio design metadata that allows the game program code to trigger game sounds. A separate FMOD Sound Bank (.FSB file) that contains the audio data is also created when the project is built. These two files are the final FMOD project deliverable and therefore are often seen packaged with game installation files.",
