      "IS2 files are created by thermal imager devices to store images similar to how .CR2 and .DCR images are created by digital cameras to store images in a raw format. The thermal imager devices are used during thermal imaging inspections of industrial electrical components such as circuits and compressors.",
      "Fluke allows you to view IS2 files recorded by the thermal imager device with its SmartView Mobile iOS app. The app comes with tools for viewing, optimizing, and analyzing infrared images."
