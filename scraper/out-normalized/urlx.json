Typically, players upload a song (saved as an .MP3, .WAV, or other type of audio file) and create an accompanying chart that defines when and what buttons they must press during that song. These charts are saved as URLX files.",
      "To export a chart as a URLX file, players press the Export button found in URLX's upper left corner. If necessary, the player can then open the resulting plain text file in any text editor, to view the data it contains."
