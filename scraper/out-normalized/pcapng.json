      "Each PCAPNG file contains several blocks or data, which contain different types of information. Examples of blocks include the section header block, interface description block, enhanced packet block, simple packet block, name resolution block, and interface statistics block. These blocks can be used to rebuild captured packets into recognizable data.",
