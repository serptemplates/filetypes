      "GIMP is a layer-based image editor used by photographers, illustrators, and graphic designers to create and alter raster graphics. XCF is the native format for saving images with GIMP, but the software also allows you to save images as archives with different types of compression. Besides gzip compression, you can export XCF images as archives compressed with bzip2 (.XCF.BZ2 and .XCFBZ2 files) and XZ (.XCF.XZ and .XCFXZ files) compression."

However, you may need to rename the .xcfgz file extension to .gz before decompressing an XCFGZ file. Possible utilities include Apple Archive Utility (Mac), 7-Zip (Windows), and PeaZip (multiplatform)."
