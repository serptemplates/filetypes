      "Tokens are used to authorize a user to gain access to a computer system or secure location. A soft token, or \"virtual token,\" is generated and sent to authorized users to verify that their device can be used within a secure network or access the server. The SDTID is used by RSA to store and distribute tokens to authorized users to allow them to gain access to a network.",
      "The primary way to distribute the SDTID files is by email or download from a secure site, which requires you to log in. You must download the RSA SecurID Software Token program in order to authenticate your identity and access the specific network.",
      "You can convert SDTID file to a compressed token format (CTF) string to be used on mobile devices, such as Android and iOS phone or tablets. You can convert the SDTID file using the RSA Software Token Converter."
