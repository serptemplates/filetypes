      "Adobe Systems developed PostScript in the early 1980s to simplify the process of converting text and graphics into printed pages. Designers, journalists, and publishers use the format to maintain precise layouts across different computers and printers. Over time, newer formats like .PDF have become more prevalent, but professional printing workflows and graphic design environments still use PS files.",
      "The primary benefits of PostScript are its ability to accurately preserve page layouts and scale images and text without loss of quality. However, the format is not as widely supported by general software today, making it more difficult for casual users to view or edit PS files. Additionally, PostScript files can be large and complex, which increases processing and loading times."
