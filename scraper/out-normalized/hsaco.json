      "High-performance computing (HPC), scientific simulations, machine learning, and other computationally intensive applications use the HSACO format to improve parallel GPU processing. Developers create the files by compiling source code written in languages, like C++, with GPU-specific extensions.",
      "Instead of targeting a CPU, the compiler generates code meant to be executed directly by the GPU. Each HSACO file is tailored for a specific GPU architecture, which helps optimize performance on that hardware.",
      "NOTE: The Heterogeneous System Architecture Foundation (HSA Foundation) maintains the Heterogeneous System Architecture Code Object (HSACO) format."

      "HSACO files are not meant to be opened or modified by users. Instead, they contain binary data that the GPU executes directly.",
      "However, developers and engineers, typically working within the AMD ROCm ecosystem, can analyze the contents of HSACO files using specialized tools. Programs, such as the AMDGPU Disassembler, Radeon GPU Analyzer, and ROCm Development Tools, allow users to inspect the compiled code, verify performance characteristics, and debug GPU kernels."
