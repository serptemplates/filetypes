      "Several archive utilities allow you to extract files from split archives. For example, in 7-Zip (Windows), you can right-click the 001 file of a split archive and select 7-Zip → Extract Here to extract the files a split archive contains. Before doing so, make sure you possess all pieces of the split archive and that they are all stored in the same directory as the 001 file.",
      "Note that, because several programs can create split archives, some split archives are formatted differently than others. If you're having trouble opening a split archive in an archive utility, it might be because the program you're using does not support that split archive format."
