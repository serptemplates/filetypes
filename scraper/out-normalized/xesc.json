      "In the past, you could open a XESC file with Windows Media Player after installing Microsoft Expression Encoder or the Expression Encoder Screen Capture Codec. However, because Expression Encoder and its codec are no longer available from Microsoft, and Windows Media Player no longer supports the Expression Encoder codec, you should now open and play XESC files with VLC media player.",
      "However, if you want to play your XESC file in Windows Media Player, and you still have access to Microsoft Expression Encoder, you can use Expression Encoder to convert your XESC file to a .WMV file. Then, you can play the WMV file in Windows Media Player."
