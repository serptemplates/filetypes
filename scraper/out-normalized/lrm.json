      "Microsoft Encarta was a multimedia encyclopedia created by Microsoft. It was available on CD ROMS, DVDs, and online from 1993 until 2009. Encarta Class Server was released in 2001 and was an education platform for K-12 schools. It assisted teachers in managing lesson plans, assignments, assessments, and curriculum standards. It also allowed students to interact with teachers online and complete assignments.",
      "NOTE: Since Microsoft Encarta is no longer developed or available for download, there is no known program that can open the LRM file."
