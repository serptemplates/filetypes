      "Here is a brief overview of AIF file structure:\n\nFORM chunk: The file starts with a FORM chunk, which serves as main container for all other chunks in file. It identifies the file as AIF file.COMM chunk: This chunk contains information about audio data such as the sample rate, bit depth, number of channels and duration of the audio.SSND chunk: The audio data itself is stored in SSND (Sound Data) chunk. It contains actual audio samples in PCM format. This chunk also includes information like the offset, block size and data size.Optional chunks: AIF files can include additional chunks for storing metadata or other types of information. Some common optional chunks include NAME (file name), AUTH (author), ANNO (annotation) and INST (instrumentation).\n\nEach chunk has a specific identifier, size and data associated with it. The file structure is typically sequential, with chunks appearing one after another within the file. AIF files can be both uncompressed and lossless, meaning they retain the original audio quality. However, due to lack of compression, AIF files tend to be larger in size compared to compressed audio formats like MP3.",
      "Apple Computer developed the AIFF format in 1988, basing it on Electronic Arts' .IFF format. Standard AIF files use a sampling rate of 44.1KHz, are 16-bit, and have two channels for stereo sound.",
      "AIF files are similar to .MP3 files, but they are saved in an uncompressed format, whereas MP3 files are compressed. This difference results in larger AIF files while storing higher-quality audio.",
      "NOTE: AIF files may also be saved with the .aiff file extension (.AIFF files)."
