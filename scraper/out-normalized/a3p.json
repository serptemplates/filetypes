      "Alice is an educational programming language and IDE that teachers use to teach programming concepts to middle-grade students. In Alice, students drag and drop characters, objects, and code snippets to produce 3D animations. A student can edit their animation in either Alice's Scene Editor, which allows the student to add and manipulate objects, or Code Editor, which allows the student to animate objects.",
      "Alice 3 saves students' animation projects as A3P files. From within Alice 3, students can export the animation their A3P file contains as an .A3W file, which is a Zip archive that contains all the animation's assets. Students can use their A3W file to play their animation in the Alice Player, a standalone Alice animation player.",
      "NOTE: A3P files are not compatible with previous versions of Alice, and animation projects created in previous versions of Alice are not compatible with Alice 3."
