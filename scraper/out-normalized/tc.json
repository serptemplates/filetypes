      "An anonymous group of developers named TrueCrypt Foundation developed TrueCrypt as a tool for securing sensitive data. The foundation released it in February 2004 but ended its development in 2014. VeraCrypt, a fork of TrueCrypt, replaced the tool and still supports the TC format. However, users often convert old TrueCrypt volumes to more actively maintained encryption formats for better security."
