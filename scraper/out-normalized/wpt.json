You can use the WordPerfect word processor in home, academic, and business environments to author various documents, such as reports, letters, invitations, resumes, flyers, and newsletters.",
      "While the proprietary Corel WPD document format is the main file type associated with WordPerfect, WPT templates are a helpful format when you want to re-use a document to create other documents with a similar layout or content. Examples of commonly used templates include company letterheads, business memos, legal forms, and mailing envelopes."
