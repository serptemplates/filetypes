      "The MSIX bundle format is the successor to the .APPXBUNDLE format. MSIX extends AppX with new features, including improved support for desktop apps that are built with older technologies such as Win32, WinForms, and WPF. MSIX is forward compatible, meaning that an existing app packaged with AppX can also be repackaged and deployed with MSIX.",
      "The different architectures in MSIX bundles allow the appropriate version of the app to be installed on a computer. For example, while a 32-bit computer may receive the x86 version of the app, a 64-bit system receives the x64 version. By including multiple architectures into an MSIXBUNDLE file, developers can support a wide range of devices and optimize apps for targeted architectures.",
      "MSIX bundles are created using Microsoft's MSIX SDK, which is available with Visual Studio. Developers can upload bundles to the Windows Store for distribution or make them available for sideloading, a process that is used for installing apps manually.",
      "NOTE: Single MSIX packages use the .MSIX file extension."
