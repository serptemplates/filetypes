      "JNX files are available through a BirdsEye subscription. They can support up to 5000 tiles per level but allow for fast rendering speeds. One drawback to the format is that it locks to a device meaning you cannot create a JNX file from another raster map. JNX files are still usable after your BirdsEye subscription has ended."
