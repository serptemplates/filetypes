      "AutoHotkey is an open-source tool that allows users to execute complex or repetitive tasks with the press of a button. For example, users can use AutoHotkey scripts to autocorrect documents' spelling, perform Google searches from their desktop, and quickly enter the same information in a number of repetitive forms.",
      "The scripts AutoHotkey uses to automatically execute tasks are saved as AHK files. AHK files link tasks to hotkeys (or keyboard shortcuts). AHK files can also contain hotstrings, which automatically replace certain text strings when typing."
