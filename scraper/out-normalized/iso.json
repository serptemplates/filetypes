      "The overall structure of the file consists of:\n\nSystem Area - 32,768 bytes and is unused by ISO_9660Data Area - consists of Volume descriptor set and Path tables, directories and files",
      "ISO files are saved in an uncompressed format based on the ISO-9660 file system standard for optical disc media (hence the .iso file extension and \"Disc Image\" file type). The files are archives that store all the data from a disk image, including the filesystem information, such as directory structures, file attributes, and boot code. Additionally, ISO files are typically large since they store a lot of data.",
      "Before streaming media, many computer users extracted, copied, and burned ISO files from and to optical discs, such as CDs and DVDs, to copy, share, or back up their contents. ISO files store a sector-by-sector copy of every bit of data exactly from the disc, which is different than copying all files from a disc because the disc header information is lost in the copy process.",
      "Users may also download ISO files from the Internet when installing new software or operating systems since an ISO file contains all the necessary information for installation. For example, you can download an ISO file from Microsoft.com to create a bootable installation media, such as a USB flash drive, or to create a virtual machine running Windows 11."

In Windows 8 and later, you can mount an ISO file without third-party software by choosing the file and then selecting Manage → Mount in File Explorer.",
      "In macOS, you can mount an ISO file by double-clicking the file. After clicking the file, the DiskImageMounter utility bundled with macOS verifies the disk image's integrity and mounts it after confirming the disk image.",
      "You can extract files from an ISO archive to access individual files, such as .BIN or .CFG files. You can use various archive utilities, including Corel WinZip, 7-Zip, and RARLAB WinRAR to extract files from an ISO file.",
      "While burning ISO files to discs is no longer as common as it once was, you may still want to burn an ISO file to a disc to create a physical backup or share data or media. In Windows 7 and later, you can right-click an ISO file and select Burn Disk Image. You can also burn ISO files to discs with third-party software, such as Roxio Toast and PowerISO."
