      "The WOZ format, which is named after Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, was released in 2018 and came from the Applesauce project. It is developed by John K. Morris with the purpose of providing a simple disk image format that accurately stores data as it is encoded in an Apple II floppy disk. WOZ files can be opened by emulators, such as MAME and OpenEmulator."
