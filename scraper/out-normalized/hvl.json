      "Hively Tracker is a music tracker inspired by Abyss' Highest eXperience (AHX), a classic tracker available for Amiga computers. Like AHX, Hively Tracker can import and export audio modules saved in the .AHX format. However, Hively Tracker can also create modules saved in the HVL format, which improves upon the AHX format in several ways (including the ability to contain multichannel audio and use per-channel stereo panning).",
      "NOTE: Hively Tracker is available for Windows, macOS, AmigaOS, and MorphOS."
