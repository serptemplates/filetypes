      "The JIC format is primarily associated with Intel's Quartus Prime development software, which engineers use to design logic for FPGAs and other programmable logic devices. When generating a JIC file, engineers typically include the FPGA's programming data along with any necessary bootloaders or supporting logic that must be stored in non-volatile memory.",
      "A JIC file typically stores the following:",
      "Raw configuration bitstream – The core programming data for the FPGA, usually converted from a SOF SRAM Object file and formatted for storage in flash memory.",
      "Header and metadata – Information about memory type, addressing, and device settings, which guides how the data should be written to the target device.",
      "Optional user data or secondary images – In some cases, the file may include additional content, such as backup configurations or user-defined data blocks.",
      "NOTE: The JTAG interface is a common method for programming and debugging digital systems, and the JIC format is one of several supported by Intel tools to deliver configuration data to target devices through the interface."
