      "PRSX files are saved in a proprietary format and are similar to .PPSX files saved by Microsoft PowerPoint. They are designed for storing a completed slide show and when they are double-clicked, the slide show begins full screen on the user's computer. PRSX files are also useful for sending finished presentations to other Presentations users."
