      "QB2017 files are used by QuickBooks for Mac to store company data, whereas the Windows version of QuickBooks uses the .QBW file to store company data. If you create a backup of your data in QuickBooks for Mac, the program will generate a .DMG file to store the backup. The Windows version of QuickBooks generates a .QBB file to store backup data.",
      "If your computer crashes or files become corrupt you can restore your QB2017 company file with the DMG backup file. To restore your QB2017 company file from a backup:",
      "Go to your backed-up disk image and double-click the icon in order to mount it.",
