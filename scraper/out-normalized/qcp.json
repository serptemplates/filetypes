      "In 1999, Qualcomm released the QCP format for use on mobile phones. In the past, many companies' mobile phones supported the QCP format. Primarily, the QCP format is optimized for storing voice memos. It uses variable encoding rates to take advantage of natural pauses in human speech.",
      "Sometimes, users sent QCP voice memos and ringtones as email attachments. Other users could play these files using Qualcomm's PureVoice Player-Recorder, a plug-in for email applications, and convert them to the .PCM format using Qualcomm PureVoice Converter. Both these applications have since been discontinued and are no longer available. However, there are still some applications that allow users to play and convert QCP files."

You can download it from Qualcomm’s website.After installing, simply open the software and load your QCP file for playback.\n\nVLC Media Player:\n\nVLC, a popular open-source media player, can often play QCP files. If VLC doesn’t recognize the file directly, try renaming the file extension to .wav and then open it.VLC is widely available and supports many uncommon formats.\n\nRealPlayer:\n\nAnother media player that supports QCP files is RealPlayer. You can use it to open and play your QCP file without needing additional plugins.\n\nAudacity (with FFmpeg Plugin):\n\nAudacity, a free audio editor, can open QCP files if you install the FFmpeg plugin.
