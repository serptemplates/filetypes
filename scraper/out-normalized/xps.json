      "The XPS format was designed as a replacement for the Enhanced Metafile (.EMF) format. It is similar to the PDF format, but is based on XML instead of PostScript.",

After you save a document as an XPS file, you can no longer edit it. You can, however, open, view, sign, and manage the file's permissions in Microsoft XPS Viewer.",
      "Old versions of Windows (Vista to 10) came pre-installed with Microsoft XPS Viewer. In later releases of Windows 10, Microsoft stopped installing XPS Viewer by default. Instead, XPS Viewer is now an optional feature that Windows 10 and 11 users can enable if they choose."
