      "You will most likely never see a TAX17 file since TurboTax saves tax returns as TAX2017 files by default. However, if you do come across the TAX17 file you can open it with the 2017 desktop version of TurboTax, which is available for both Windows and macOS. You can then save the tax return as a TAX2017 file.",
      "TAX17 files can be electronically submitted to the IRS and state tax authorities when completed. The \"e-file\" process is free for federal returns but usually requires a fee to file state returns electronically. TAX17 files can also be printed and mailed."
