      "BIMX files are often used by builders, clients, and consultants to view proposed models. You can view BIMX models interactively with software. For example, you can virtually walk through a building model and view construction details.",
      "If you come across the BIMX file on your computer, you can view it using several BIMx programs. The BIMx Desktop Viewer for Windows and macOS (OS X) comes with ArchiCAD. However, you cannot save BIMX files with this program, only view them. You can also view BIMX files with the BIMx apps for Android and iOS."
