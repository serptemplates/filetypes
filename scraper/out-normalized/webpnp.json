      "WEBPNP files are often distributed using the Web Point-and-Print Protocol ([MS-WPRN]), which defines a method for downloading print drivers when a user clicks on a webpage link (an HTTP request) or a client program requests a driver. The website locates the appropriate driver and then returns a WEBPNP file to the requester. Once downloaded, the file can be opened to install the printer drivers.",
      "WEBPNP files may contain the following contents:",
      "Printer driver and installation files",
      "An .INF setup file for the installation",
      "A .BIN file specifying parameters needed to access printer configuration data",
      "A .DAT file that includes any other printer setup data",
