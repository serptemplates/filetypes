      "Hobbyists, designers, and professionals who work with ELEGOO's range of resin 3D printers are the primary users of the GOO format. These users typically craft high-resolution models for applications such as miniatures, prototypes, or functional parts. The format is prevalent among users of ELEGOO resin printers like the Saturn 3 Ultra and Jupiter SE.",
      "Users generate GOO files with slicer software compatible with ELEGOO printers, most notably SatelLite. For example, the software imports a 3D model file (e.g., .STL or .OBJ) and slices it into layers, converting it into the GOO format with all necessary printing parameters. Users can then customize settings before exporting the file in GOO format."
