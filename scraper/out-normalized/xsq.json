      "Lighting display enthusiasts use xLights to design lighting display sequences set to music. For example, an xLights user might use the program to design a holiday sequence set to the song Winter Wonderland. To design a sequence, a user imports a song, specifies the lighting elements their display includes, and adds lighting effects associated with each element along a timeline. (Users can also design displays that are not set to music. In this case, the user does not import a song.)",
      "At any time, the user can save the sequence they've designed as an XSQ file. This allows them to close, reopen, and continue editing the sequence at a later time. Users can also download XSQ files created by other xLight users online. Typically, when users share XSQ files, they package them with other files needed to load the sequence, such as related .XML files, images, shaders, and the sequence's associated audio file."
