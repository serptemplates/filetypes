      "In May 2019, Windows 10 began storing certain system resources in MUN files. Most notably, MUN files contain the icons used by many system-level and pre-installed Windows programs, such as Control Panel and Microsoft Paint.",
      "Most often, MUN files are associated with corresponding .EXE or .DLL files. For example, mspaint.exe.mun is associated with mspaint.exe, the executable file that launches Microsoft Paint. However, MUN files themselves are not executable files or libraries. Rather, they are compressed archives that contain files referenced by a program or library."

To do so, open IconsExtract, select File → Search for Icons, and then browse to and search the C:/​Windows/​SystemResources directory.",
      "If you want to explore all the files contained within a MUN archive, you can open and explore the archive with 7-Zip. Note, however, that you cannot use 7-Zip to automatically extract the files contained within a MUN archive. You can, however, use it to manually copy the files contained within a MUN file to a new folder."
