      "Drive Snapshot allows Windows users to create backup copies of their drives. They can then use these backups to restore or recover their files if needed.",
      "If a drive's contents are small enough, Drive Snapshot saves them in a single SNA file. However, if the drive contains a large amount of data, Drive Snapshot creates continuation files that contain the rest of the drive's data. These files use the same base filename as their associated SNA file, but the .SN1, .SN2, and so on extensions. For example, a file named Backup.sn1 is the first continuation file for a backup named Backup.sna."

      "You can use Drive Snapshot (Windows) to view and restore the files an SN1 file contains. To do so, you will need the SN1 file's accompanying SNA file, as well as any other continuation files included in that backup (such as an SN2, SN3, etc. file).",
      "After you've placed all the files associated with your Drive Snapshot backup in the same directory, open Drive Snapshot and select either Restore Disk from File, to restore your backup's contents, or View contents of saved Disk Image, to view your backup's contents. Then, browse to your SNA file and restore or view your backup's contents."
