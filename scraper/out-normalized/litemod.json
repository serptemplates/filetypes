If there is no \"mods\" folder, create one. Once installed, LITEMOD files are designed to not conflict with other installed mods and mod loaders, such as Minecraft Forge.",
      "NOTE: When downloading LITEMOD files, your browser may detect the file as a .ZIP file and give it a \"zip\" extension. This will prevent the mod from properly working, so rename the extension to \"litemod\" before placing it in the \"mods\" folder."
