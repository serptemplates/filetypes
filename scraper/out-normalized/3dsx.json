      "Homebrew launchers allow gamers to install and run unofficial games and other applications on video game consoles. The Nintendo 3DS's homebrew launcher is often used to play old Super Nintendo games and region-locked 3DS games, as well as run custom applications.",
      "Homebrew 3DS games and applications are most often saved in the 3DSX file format. The 3DSX format is designed to function with a variety of homebrew exploits, to ensure that 3DSX-based apps can be run on any homebrew-enabled 3DS.",
      "NOTE: The 3DS homebrew launcher is itself saved in a 3DSX file. This file is named boot.3dsx, and it should be placed at the root of your 3DS's SD card."

      "Typically, you should place 3DSX files other than boot.3dsx in your SD card's 3ds folder. (If your SD card does not have a 3ds folder, you will have to create one.) To run some 3DSX apps, you may instead need to create an app-specific sub-folder inside the 3ds folder and place your 3DSX file in that folder."
