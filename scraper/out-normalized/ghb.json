      "Lego Racers was released in 1999 as a racing game for Windows, Nintendo 64, PlayStation, and Game Boy Color. The game provides a variety of tracks set around Legoland with each track including power-ups that the racers can attain to gain advantages. The game features a \"Circuit Race\" mode, \"Single Race\" mode, and \"Time Race\" mode. The \"Time Race\" mode is where you would see the ghost path that is stored in the GHB file.",
      "The GHB file is created when a racer completes a time trial race. The racer's path is recorded as numbers and stored in the GHB file. It is called a \"ghost path\" because it is the path the semi-transparent, ghost-looking racer in the game follows when you challenge a previous race.",
      "GHB files are located in the LEGO.jam archive, which can be found in the Lego Racers game installation location. The files can be found in all of the race track folders except for the \"TEST\" (test track) and RACEC3R0 (Rocket Racer Run) because those tracks do not allow trial races. You can extract GHB files and other game files from the JAM archive using a JAM extractor.",
      "NOTE: Lego Racers is no longer available for download."
