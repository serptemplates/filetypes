      "Gallery uses THUMBDATA3--1967290299 to cache information about images it has indexed. This caching helps Gallery load images more quickly and reduces lag time when displaying thumbnails.",
      "The more images you have in your Gallery app, the larger THUMBDATA3--1967290299 grows. If you have a large number of thumbnail images in Gallery, your THUMBDATA3--1967290299 may become several hundred MBs or even several GBs in size. The file increases in size every time a new image is added. Also, when you delete an image, that image's indexed properties remain in the file.",
      "To reduce a THUMBDATA3--1967290299 file's size, remove images from your Gallery app and then delete the THUMBDATA3--1967290299 file. Gallery will automatically regenerate the file, but the file will contain data for only the images still in the app.",
      "If you do not want to remove images from your device, delete THUMBDATA3--1967290299 and create a new file in the same .thumbnails folder using a file explorer, such as File Viewer for Android. Then, name the file .thumbdata3--1967290299. This will stop Gallery from recreating THUMBDATA3--1967290299.",
      "You can use an Android file manager to navigate to your thumbnail index files, which can be found in the sdcard/​DCIM/​.thumbnails directory.",
      "NOTE: THUMBDATA3--1967290299 is commonly accompanied by .THUMBDATA3-1763508120."
