      "ANN files are only used to describe Lingvo-formatted dictionaries. This format is developed by ABBYY, an international software company. ANN files are optional, but if they are created, they are named after an associated .DSL file (e.g., example.dsl and example.ann). ANN files should be placed in the same folder as the DSL file.",
