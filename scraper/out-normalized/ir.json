      "Flipper Zero is a portable multi-tool that, among other things, can be used to analyze signals, clone identification cards, and act as an infrared remote. To act as an infrared remote, Flipper Zero uses a set of IR files. Each file corresponds to a specific device and contains data used to issue commands to that device.",
      "IR files are plain text files, which specify the device with which they are meant to be used and associated commands. Multiple collections of custom IR files are available online, such as the one available at logickworkshop's Flipper-IRDB GitHub page."
