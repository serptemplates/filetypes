      "These days, most Wii USB Loaders and emulators can process files larger than 4GB. So, in order to play a game that is saved across both a WBFS and WBF1 file, you should:",
      "Move both files to a single folder.",
      "Rename your WBFS file to use the wbfs.001 extension. Then, rename your WBF1 file to use the wbfs.002 extension.",
      "Use a Zip-compresion program like 7-Zip to extract the files from the folder, merging them into one WBFS file.",
      "Load and play the WBFS file on your Nintendo Wii or Wii emulator.",
      "If your Wii USB Loader cannot process files larger than 4GB, do not perform the steps above. Instead, make sure your WBFS and WBF1 files are stored in the same folder on your USB drive or PC, before opening and playing your WBFS file."
