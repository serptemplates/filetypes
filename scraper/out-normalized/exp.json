      "EXP is a proprietary file format originating from surveillance cameras. Due to its proprietary nature, there are no available applications designed specifically for converting EXP files. The recommended approach is to utilize the built-in player provided by the surveillance camera system to play EXP files. It is important to note that the EXP file format lacks compatible codecs, players, or converters. Therefore, it is necessary to rely on the dedicated player provided by the security camera system to access and view these files."
