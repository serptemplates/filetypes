      "Apple Numbers is part of Apple's iWork suite, which also includes Keynote (for presentations) and Pages (for documents). The application was introduced solely for Macs with Apple's iWork '08 productivity suite, but Apple later released an iOS and iCloud web version.",
      "Numbers is commonly used to organize numeric data such as business income and expenses, monthly active users for an app or website, or church attendance. You can choose to sort and view data in a variety of ways, such as in a formatted table or chart. You can also add text, shapes, and media (photos, music, and videos) to your NUMBERS file to enhance the presentation of the data.",
      "The NUMBERS file is the main file type associated with the Numbers program. When you save your spreadsheet in Numbers, the program creates a NUMBERS file to store the spreadsheet information. The file is similar to the .XLSX file, which is used by Microsoft Excel to store spreadsheets."
