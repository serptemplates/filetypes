      "WordCompress was a WordPress plug-in that deleted all comments and white space within a webpage's source code and wrote the code to a single executable line. This allowed web browsers to load the page more quickly. Each webpage's compressed code was saved within a COMPRESSED file.",
      "WordPress and WordCompress store COMPRESSED files alongside webpages' original source code. That way, any comments, indentations, and other white space included in the page's original source code are not destroyed when it is converted to a COMPRESSED file."
