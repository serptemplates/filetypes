      "The internal data structure and alignment of each byte in the structure of a BTR file is not publicly available. However, Btrieve provides the Btrieve API that can be used to read the information from BTR files. It is compatible with the following programming languages and development environments.\n\nEmbarcadero C/C++Embarcadero DelphiGNU C/C++Micro Focus COBOLMicrosoft Visual BasicMicrosoft Visual C++Watcom C/C++\n\nRetrieving data from a BTR file is dependent on the associated DDF file with it.
