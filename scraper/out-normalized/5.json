      "Unix-like OSes include a system manual that is divided into eight numbered sections. This manual's fifth section usually describes the file formats the system supports. Each supported format is documented in a separate 5 file.",

      "In some Unix systems, such as System V, 5 files instead contain documentation of miscellaneous system information. These 5 files can still be accessed using the man utility.",
      "NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1, .2, .3, .4, .6, .7, and .8 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."
