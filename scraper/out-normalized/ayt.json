      "Ayat automatically loads all necessary AYT files when you start the program. So if you have access to Ayat, you should not need to manually open an AYT file.",
      "However, you may have difficulty installing Ayat on computers using modern operating systems. If you want to access the files contained within an AYT archive without using Ayat, you can rename the AYT file to use the .ZIP extension. Then, you can extract the files contained within the ZIP archive and open them as you would any image, audio, or database file."
