      "SlySoft CloneCD was a CD and DVD burning application that could be used to make exact copies of music, video, and data discs, regardless of Digital Rights Management (DRM) restrictions. When CloneCD created a disk image from a disc, it saved the disk image data across a number of files. The disk image's main data was saved in an IMG file, its subchannel data was saved in a .SUB file, and its control data was saved in a CCD file. The disk image's control data specified what type of data the original disc contained, as well as how that data was structured.",
      "When creating a new disc using CloneCD, users needed to supply the IMG, CCD, and SUB files CloneCD created from the original disc. While CloneCD is now discontinued, other disc-burning applications can still be used to combine CloneCD IMG, CCD, and SUB files into usable discs."
