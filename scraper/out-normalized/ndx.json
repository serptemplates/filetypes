      "Application developers and database managers use dBASE to create, maintain, and access databases. Optionally, dBASE users can create one or more index files for a dBASE database. These files contain select data and pointers to associated full records in the database, which dBASE can use to retrieve those records more quickly.",
      "In versions III and below, dBASE saved index files in the NDX format. Notably, dBASE did not automatically update a database's associated NDX file(s) when a user made changes to the database. Instead, the user had to manually command dBASE to update the NDX file(s). In contrast, dBASE IV and above automatically update index files when a user makes a change to an associated database.",
