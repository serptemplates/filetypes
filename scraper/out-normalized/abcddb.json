      "Since the file is SQLite 3 datafile, you can export the data inside abcddb file into Microsoft Access using ODBC connector.\n\nThe SQLite ODBC connector is a software library and driver that enables applications that support the ODBC interface to connect to a SQLite database. It includes a library that defines the ODBC interface, and a driver that translates this interface into calls to the SQLite API. To utilize the SQLite ODBC connector, you must first install it and then set up an ODBC data source on your computer. After completing these steps, any application that is equipped with ODBC support will be able to connect to the data source and retrieve data from the SQLite database."
