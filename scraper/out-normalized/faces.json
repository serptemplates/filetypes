      "FacesServlet is a JavaServer Faces servlet that manages a web app's request processing lifecycle. In order to invoke FacesServlet and allow it to render the JavaServer Faces components included in an XHTML file, developers must sometimes specify a file path that ends with the .faces, .jsf, or .xhtml extension. When FacesServlet encounters a file path that ends with .faces, it knows to search for a corresponding XHTML file that includes JavaServer Faces components."
