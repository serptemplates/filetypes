      "The NintendoWare Bezel Engine is a game engine Nintendo released to make Switch video game development easier for third-party developers. However, both official Nintendo games and third-party games use the Bezel Engine.",

      "The NBMAP files found in Switch video games are binary files. However, when being developed in the Bezel Engine, NBMAP files are XML files. The Bezel Engine converts NBMAP files to binary files when compiling a developer's game."
