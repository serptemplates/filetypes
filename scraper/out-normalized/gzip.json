      "In 1992, Jean-loup Gailly and Mark Adler created the gzip utility and file format for use with Unix systems. gzip was packaged with GNU, a collection of free software, and intended to replace previous Unix file compression programs. gzip proved useful enough that is still used today, primarily by Linux and other Unix-like users.",
