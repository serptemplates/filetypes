      "In 1983, CNC Software released the first version of Mastercam. Mastercam was one of the first CAD and CAM applications that allowed machinists and engineers to model mechanical parts and help automate part production.",
      "Over the years, CNC Software has released many subsequent versions of Mastercam. In 2014, CNC Software released Mastercam X8. Mastercam X8 saved users' 3D part designs as MCX-8 files.",
      "In 2019, CNC Software discontinued Mastercam X8, suggesting that users should upgrade to the then-current version of Mastercam, Mastercam 2020. However, current versions of Mastercam can still open MCX-8 files."
