      "In 2011, Amazon began releasing digital textbooks for Kindle saved in the AZW4 format. While this format uses an extension similar to the .AZW and .AZW3 extensions, AZW4 files are different than AZW and AZW3 files. For example, because AZW4 files are comprised of PDF pages, their text does not reflow. Readers can also zoom and pan within AZW4 eBooks.",
      "AZW4 files purchased from Amazon use the same DRM protections as Amazon-provided .MOBI files. To create an AZW4 file, publishers submit a PDF of their book to Amazon. Amazon then packages the PDF in a copy-protected AZW4 file and makes it available in the Kindle Store."
