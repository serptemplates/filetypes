      "The Nokia Ovi Store is a notable source of DM files. Typically, the Ovi Store downloads and installs DM files in the background, so users will never encounter them. However, users sometimes download DM files manually, using an app like the Ovi-Store add-on for the Opera web browser, and save them to their computers. Users can then install these DM files using Nokia Ovi Suite.",
      "For example, users might encounter DM files saved with the .SIS.DM and .SISX.DM extensions. These files are copy-protected .SIS and .SISX files, which often contain apps downloaded from the Nokia Ovi Store.",
      "Sony Ericsson phones also use audio files and apps saved as DM files. Both types of phones use Symbian OS, so the DM files they use are similar."
