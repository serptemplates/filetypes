      "The MSIM file most often appears to users when they utilize mSecure's \"Email Backup\" function, which is helpful for protecting your data in case of accidental app removal or damage. You can email a backup of your mSecure data to yourself that can be opened in case you lose your data. When restoring the data you will be prompted to enter your login password you used when making the backup. After entering the password you will be then given the option to restore the data.",
