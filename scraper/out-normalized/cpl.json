      "The Windows Control Panel, which is included in every Windows installation, is a program that allows users to adjust many of their Windows settings. For example, users can use Control Panel to configure system and security settings, add devices and printers, uninstall programs, and change their computer's date and time formats.",
      "When a user accesses a Control Panel feature, Windows loads the corresponding CPL file in Control Panel. For example, when a user clicks Uninstall a program in Control Panel, Windows loads the Programs and Features item from AppWiz.cpl.",
