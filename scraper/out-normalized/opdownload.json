      "An OPDOWNLOAD file is usually an incomplete download file created by the Opera web browser. When you download a file in Opera, it creates an OPDOWNLOAD file and once the download is complete, it renames the file to its original format. Therefore, it is not possible to convert an OPDOWNLOAD file to MP4 or ZIP, as it is not a valid file format. You need to wait until the download is complete and the file is renamed to its original format before you can convert it to MP4 or ZIP. If you are unable to complete the download or the file is corrupt, you may need to restart the download or try downloading the file from a different source."
