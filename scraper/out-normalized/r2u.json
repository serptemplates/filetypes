      "Ransomware is a form of malware that renames and encrypts a user's files so they cannot open them. After encrypting a user's files, ransomware programs produce a ransom note that instructs users on how they can (supposedly) pay a ransom to restore their files.",

      "Ransomware is most commonly distributed in email attachments and programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and opened an unverified attachment or program, that may be how your computer became infected by R2U ransomware."
