      "FoxPro is a programming language and database management system. It was originally released in 1989 by Fox Software then acquired by Microsoft in 1992. It eventually became Visual FoxPro and was used to manage large volumes of data for desktop, distributed client, client/server, rich client, and web database applications. Visual FoxPro was eventually discontinued with the last version (9) released in 2004 and last updated in 2007."
