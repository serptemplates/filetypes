      "When you create a map from scratch or from an .EMMT template and save it, MindMaple creates the EMM file to store the map contents. You can export the file to other file formats such as .DOC, .XLS, .PPT, .HTML, .JPEG, and .TXT.",
      "MindMaple is designed to help you visually organize ideas. You can create maps that consist of ideas placed in nodes that can be connected to other nodes and images. MindMaple is available for Windows, macOS, and iOS in Lite and Pro editions."
