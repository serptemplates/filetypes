      "The \"crypt8\" extension is commonly appended to a .DB file to create the .DB.CRYPT8 file, which is used by WhatsApp to secure a user's message database on his or her Android device. For each new installment, the application uses a different algorithm to encrypt the DB files. The extension appended to the DB file, such as \"crypt6\" or \"crypt7\", signifies the algorithm.",
      "The CRYPT8 database files will be located in the following directory: /​sdcard/​WhatsApp/​Databases",
      "NOTE: The encryption algorithm between the older .CRYPT7 file and the newer CRYPT8 file is the same."
