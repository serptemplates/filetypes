      "Microsoft Outlook downloads the Offline Address Book periodically (typically every 8 hours) to ensure it stays updated with the latest contact information from the Exchange server. The local OAB file copy helps reduce network usage by limiting the need to fetch contact details from the server each time they are accessed. The file type also supports efficient email communication within large organizations by offering quick, offline access to frequently needed contact information.",
