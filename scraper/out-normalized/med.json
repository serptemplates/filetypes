      "In 1991, developer Teijo Kinnunen and publisher RBF Software released OctaMED, a follow-up to the popular MED sound tracker. While MED used only MED files to store sounds, OctaMED used both MED and .8MED files to do the same.",
      "OctaMED was notable for being able to play eight-channel audio on the Commodore Amiga's four-channel sound chip. While OctaMED was ported to Windows in the late 1990s (under the name MED Soundstudio), it is no longer developed or maintained."
