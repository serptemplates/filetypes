      "Yamaha offers a wide range of instruments, including pianos, drums, guitars, basses, and keyboards, and users can create custom styles or download them from various websites. However, it’s important to note that while Korg, a competitor to Yamaha, also uses the .STY extension for their style files, the formats are different and not interchangeable. This means Yamaha styles are only compatible with Yamaha keyboards, and Korg styles work exclusively with Korg keyboards."
