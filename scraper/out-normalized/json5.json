      "JSON is a text-based data interchange format used primarily by web developers. While .JSON files are human-readable, the developers of JSON5 felt the JSON format could be modified to make manually writing, reading, and maintaining JSON data easier.",
      "To do this, the JSON5 team added several features of ECMAScript 5.1 to the standard JSON format. Some of these features include:",
      "Objects and arrays may have a single trailing comma",
      "Strings may be single-quoted, span multiple lines, and include character escapes",
      "Numbers may be hexadecimal, have a leading or trailing decimal point, and begin with an explicit plus sign",
      "Single-line comments, multi-line comments, and white space characters are allowed",
      "Because JSON5 is a superset of JSON, all JSON files are valid JSON5 files. Additionally, because JSON5 is a subset of ECMAScript 5.1, most JSON5 files are valid ECMAScript 5.1 files."
