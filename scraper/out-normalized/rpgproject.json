      "RPG Maker MV provides a variety of features to meet the needs of RPG developers. It is available as a standalone Windows version with a complementary RPG Maker MV Steam key for Windows/OS X. The application uses JavaScript with HTML5, which allows experienced developers to control all parts of the game with no hidden classes. RPG Maker MV also comes with a large number of sample maps and character parts to get novice developers started more quickly on the development of their games. RPGs developed with RPG Maker MV can be delivered across multiple platforms including Windows, OS X, Android, iOS, and HTML5 for web browsers.",
      "NOTE: The RPGPROJECT file should not be confused with the .RVPROJ2 project file, which is created using the RPG Maker VX Ace application."
