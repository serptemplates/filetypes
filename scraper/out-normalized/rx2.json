      "The REX2 format, RX2 files, and REX files are quite popular among audio producers and supported by most popular DAWs. Most importantly, the REX2 format allows audio producers to divide audio loops into \"slices,\" using markers that denote a zero crossing in a waveform. By timing each slice to a specific playback time, REX2 loops can easily be included in songs that use different tempos.",
      "NOTE: The REX in REX2 stands for ReCycle Export, which references the name of the ReCycle software used to create RX2 and REX files."
