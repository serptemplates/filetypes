      "Mixcraft is a digital audio workstation (DAW) available for Windows. Acoustica released Mixcraft 8 in May 2017. This version of Mixcraft saves users' music and music video projects as MX8 files.",
      "An MX8 file may contain an audio project and/or a music video project. Music video projects also include an imported video and effects applied to that video. After finalizing a project, users can export the music they've created as .MP3, .OGG, or .WAV files. They can export finalized music videos as .AVI or .WMV files."

For example, if you open an MX8 file in Mixcraft 9 and attempt to save it, you will have to save it as an .MX9 file."
