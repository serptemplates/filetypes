      "WMA files are similar to .MP3 files and are primarily used for streaming music on the web. However, they may also store other types of audio besides music, including voice narration and sound effects.",
      "WMA files utilize Microsoft's proprietary ASF container format, which supports audio and video data. A file utilizing the ASF container format that contains video and audio data, may bear the .asf file extension (.ASF file).",
      "However, WMA and .WMV files, which feature the ASF container format, are more common than ASF files. Typically, files that only store audio data encoded in one of the WMA codecs in the ASF container format have the .wma file extension (WMA files). Furthermore, a file that stores video and audio data in the ASF container format often bears the .wmv file extension (WMV file)."
