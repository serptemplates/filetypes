      "The JMCK file is one of several file extensions created by JM-Crypt software and includes \".jmc\", \".jmcx\", \".jmck\", \".jmcp\", \".jmcr\", and \".jmce\". The encrypted files are commonly used to secure confidential personal files and sensitive business files.",
      "The JMCK file is encrypted with a random extract of a long random key created by the fast Fourier transform (FFT) key generator, which is unique to JM-Crypt Security. The second encryption includes password protection that depends on the method selected by the user, which may be fully automatic (random auto-generated password used by the .JMCX file), semi-automatic (project mode, which is utilized by the .JMCP file), or manual (a password created by the user and featured in the .JMC file).",
      "NOTE: You need the JM-Crypt software and algorithm that were used to originally encrypt the file in order to decrypt the JMCK file."
