      "Analysts and researchers in various fields, including healthcare, social sciences, and education, used EZS files to streamline workflows and ensure consistency in data processing. The tool's scripting functionality made it especially helpful for automating statistical procedures.",
      "For example, an EZS script might automate a regression analysis on a dataset by importing data, running a multiple linear regression test, and outputting the results as a formatted report. This allows users to quickly repeat analyses on different datasets without reconfiguring the settings each time."
