      "NOTE: Archive Player version 2 can export captured video to .WMV and .MP4 files. It can also burn videos to CD and DVD formats. WMV exports include a required \".sig\" file, and MP4 exports include a required \".ind\" index file. Previous Archive Player versions can export recorded video to .AVI files. However, to play them, you must have the Xvid codec installed."
