      "Using Sibelius, composers can create, edit, play back, and annotate musical scores. Composers can create a score manually, by placing and adjusting notation within Sibelius, or they can record themselves playing on a MIDI input device, to automatically add the notes they play to their score.",
      "By default, Sibelius saves the scores that composers create as SIB files. In addition to the score a composer has created, each SIB file also includes various score metadata, such as the score's title, subtitle, composer, arranger, and copyright information. Composers can edit and view this metadata on Sibelius's File → Info screen.",
      "If a composer wants to share a Sibelius score they've created with musicians who do not have access to Sibelius, they can export the score in a variety of other, more common formats. To do so, a composer selects File → Export."
