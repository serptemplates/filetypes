      "Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ as an improvement upon the C language developed by Dennis Ritchie in the late 1960s. He began development in 1979 to add object-oriented programming (OOP) features, named it \"C++\" (formerly known as \"C with Classes\") in 1983, and then released it in 1985.",
      "C++ soon became one of the most prominent programming languages, with developers utilizing it to create various applications, such as web browsers, games, and database management software. The non-profit Standard C++ Foundation now develops the language.",

      "You can open and edit CC files with many source code editors, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code (multiplatform) and Code Blocks (multiplatform). These applications are ideal for viewing and editing CC files since they provide helpful tools, such as syntax highlighting and auto-completion.",
      "You can also open and edit CC files with plain text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad (bundled with Windows) or Apple TextEdit (bundled with macOS). However, these text editors do not provide helpful source code editing features.",
      "You can compile the C++ code stored in CC files to code run on a computer with various free and commercial compilers. Some compilers include Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows), Eclipse IDE for C Developers (multiplatform), GNU Compiler Collection (multiplatform), and Apple Xcode (macOS)."
