      "Users typically encounter C3DP files when saving custom objects for later use or when downloading shared prefabs from other creators. When a user imports a C3DP file into Crocotile 3D, the software reconstructs the prefab exactly as it was designed, including any associated layers or object properties. This functionality enables users to populate their scenes with complex or repetitive structures without having to manually build them each time.",
      "NOTE: You can create a C3DP file by selecting File → Export Scene and choosing .c3dp from the \"File Format\" dropdown menu. At least one object must be present in the current scene or the .c3dp format option will be greyed out."

      "Since C3DP files store plain text information, you can also open them with a text editor. However, opening them with a text editor will not display the same results as opening them with Crocotile 3D."
