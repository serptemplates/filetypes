OBML files have since been replaced by .OBML15 and .OBML16 files. Versions 5 and higher of Opera Mini cannot open OBML files."

However, current versions of most of these programs cannot open OBML files. If you still have access to an old (version 4 or below) version of Opera Mini or an old Opera Mini emulator, you may be able to use it to open your OBML file."
