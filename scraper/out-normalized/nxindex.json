      "The Mig Switch flashcart is the same size as a Switch game cartridge but contains special chips and an SD Card slot to allow users to load backup game ROMs dumped from Switch cartridges onto a Micro SD card inserted into the flashcart. When a user inserts the flashcart into a Switch, it loads games onto the Switch, but the Switch does not allow users to browse and select the games.",
      "Instead, users must eject and reinsert the flashcart multiple times to change the game. Every time a user does this, the flashcart writes the order of the games to the NXINDEX file and saves it to the Micro SD card inserted in the flashcart."

For example, you can open an NXINDEX file with HxD to confirm that your Micro SD card is on the latest firmware version or that your Micro SD card is working correctly."
