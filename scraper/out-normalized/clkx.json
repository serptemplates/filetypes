      "In Clicker, children can select words or phrases (or use an in-app keyboard) to write sentences and stories. Words and phrases are pictured in grids, which are referred to as grid sets.",
      "To create a grid set, Clicker users (or more likely, teachers or parents) select File → New Grid Set. They can then choose from different grid set templates, optimized for creating different types of grid sets. For example, Sentence Building templates are used to create preset sentence-writing grid sets, while Classifying templates are used to group similar words, pictures, and phrases together in a grid set.",
      "After creating a grid set, a user can select File → Save Grid Set to save the grid set as a CLKX file. By default, Clicker stores CLKX files saved this way in its primary installation directory."
