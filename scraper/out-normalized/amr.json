      "The AMR( Adaptive Multi-Rate ) is an audio format; widely used in various mobile applications and devices, typically in audio player/recorder or in VoIP kind of applications. AMR can be further classified as:\n\nAMR-NB( NarrowBand )AMR-WB( WideBand )\n\nUsually, AMR refers to AMR-NB. The AMR file format has the following structure:\n\nEach AMR file contains a 6-byte header that recognize the file as an AMR audio. This header is always set to:\n\n0x230x210x410x4D0x520x0A\n\nThis is usually simialr across all AMR-NB files. If the header following a standard, it is likely that the file is corrupted and should not be used. the AMR file consists of a whole number of packed frames of audio. These frames each compose 20ms of audio. Each frame can be encoded using any of the valid AMR-NB modes (0-7, 8 SID in DTX mode). Since, the frames can be encoded at different bit rates, this typical method is called Adaptive Multi-Rate(AMR).\n\nAMR modes\n\nFollowing are the different AMR modes and their corresponding bitrates:\n\nMODEBIT RATES0AMR 4.75 - Encodes at 4.75kbit/s1AMR 5.15 - Encodes at 5.15kbit/s2AMR 5.9 - Encodes at 5.9kbit/s3AMR 6.7 - Encodes at 6.7kbit/s4AMR 7.4 - Encodes at 7.4kbit/s5AMR 7.95 - Encodes at 7.95kbit/s6AMR 10.2 - Encodes at 10.2kbit/s7AMR 12.2 - Encodes at 12.2kbit/s\n\nFrame size of AMR modes in bytes (including the header byte) are given below:\n\nCMRMODEFRAME SIZE( in bytes )0AMR 4.75131AMR 5.15142AMR 5.9163AMR 6.7184AMR 7.4205AMR 7.9521",
      "AMR files incorporate the Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (ACELP) algorithm, designed to compress human speech audio efficiently. Additionally, the files may be saved in the AMR-NB (Narrowband) or AMR-WB (Wideband) format. Wideband audio supports a broader frequency range, providing better sound quality."
