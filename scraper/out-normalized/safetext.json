      "SafeText was an application primarily used in the 1990s to create encrypted, password-protected text documents so that if a person attempts to access the file, they won’t be able to view its information without the correct password. However, as newer and more advanced encryption tools and methods developed, SafeText discontinued the software in the early 2000s, making the SAF format obsolete.",
