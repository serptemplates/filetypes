      "While ChessBase Fritz typically opens IUP files automatically to update the software, if the update process does not work, users can manually update the game using the IUP file. To do this, the user must download the IUP file, place it in the Fritz installation directory, and then run the included IUPgrade.exe tool. This process applies the update so the software runs the latest version with improvements or bug fixes provided by the developer."
