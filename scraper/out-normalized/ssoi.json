      "In 2022, some PC users began reporting that their computers had been infected by a new variant of STOP ransomware. This variant encrypts users' files and appends them with the .ssoi extension. For example, an infected Word document's extension is changed from .DOCX to .docx.ssoi.",
      "After encrypting a user's files, the ransomware produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt in every folder that contains an infected file. The note contains instructions users are meant to follow to pay a ransom and receive the information needed to decrypt their files.",
      "SSOI ransomware is most commonly distributed within programs that appear to be legitimate but are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed an unverified program, that may be how your computer became infected by SSOI ransomware.",
      "NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."

      "If your computer has been infected by SSOI ransomware, the best option to restore your files to their original state is likely to perform a System Restore. Note that performing a System Restore will cause you to lose any data created in the interval between now and your last restore point. Therefore, you may want to back up any data and files created since your last restore point."
