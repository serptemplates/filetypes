      "Descent 2 is the sequel to the original Descent video game. Descent 2 contains PIG files that store, among other things, textures used to skin in-game objects. The game also contains 256 files, which correspond to a specific PIG file and describe the color palette that file's textures use. Many of the game's PIG and 256 files are stored in its .HOG mission files."
