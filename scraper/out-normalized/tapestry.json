      "Iconfactory released Tapestry in February 2025 to enable users to unify various content sources, such as blogs, social media platforms, RSS feeds, podcasts, and YouTube channels, into a single, chronological timeline. The app includes built-in connectors that work with many prominent sources, such as RSS, Tumblr, and Mastodon.",
      "However, Tapestry users can also download and add third-party connectors to work with additional sources with a publicly accessible feed on the Internet. For example, a user can download a TAPESTRY connector from the web that adds Discourse forums to their timeline, which they can filter by category or tag."
