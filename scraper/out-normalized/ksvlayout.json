      "Keyboards used to write in different languages often use different keyboard layouts. To account for this, some Adobe apps include a set of KSVLAYOUT files. These files are used to remap an app's default, English-language keyboard shortcuts if the app detects a user is using a non-English keyboard.",
      "Optionally, users can manually specify their keyboard language in apps that use KSVLAYOUT files, to remap the app's shortcuts themselves. For example, in Adobe Bridge, users can use the Keyboard option available in the Preferences → Advanced menu to specify they are using a different language's keyboard, and thus want to use different keyboard shortcuts.",
