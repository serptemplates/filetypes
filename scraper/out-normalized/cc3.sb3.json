      "Scratch is a block-based development environment that children and other aspiring programmers use to learn to code. ClipCC is a modified version of Scratch, developed by Clipteam and available for Windows, macOS, and Linux, as well as on the web. It contains additional features that extend and enhance Scratch's functionality.",
      "When a developer saves a development project in ClipCC, it is saved as a CC3.SB3 file by default. This compound extension denotes that the project was created by ClipCC, and not the default version of Scratch. However, developers can open CC3.SB3 files with Scratch 3, just as they would any other .SB3 file."
