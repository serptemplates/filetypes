      "Gamers who wish to decompress, decrypt, and examine their XEX files' binary data can use XexTool, a Windows command-line utility, to do so. Decompressing and decrypting a XEX file will allow you to view and edit the file's data in a hex editor. Editing a XEX file's data may cause the file to no longer function, so most gamers should not edit their XEX files."
