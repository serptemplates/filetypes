      "VMDL files were introduced with the release of the Source 2 engine. The files replaced the .MDL files. A VMDL file is created from a mesh file stored in an .FBX, .OBJ, or .DMX file. To do this, open Model Editor, select File → New VMDL From Mesh File and choose a mesh. After selecting a mesh, the VMDL file is created and named with the same name as the mesh. For example, a sample.fbx mesh file becomes a sample.vmdl file."
