      "AxCrypt is a file encryption software designed for Windows (and later macOS, Android, and iOS) that enables users to securely encrypt individual files using strong encryption standards, such as AES-128 and AES-256 (it also provides built-in file compression to reduce file sizes). Individuals, small businesses, and privacy-conscious users who want a simple way to encrypt files for storage or transmission primarily use AxCrypt and AXX files to protect sensitive documents such as financial records, personal files, or work-related data.",
      "NOTE: Axantum Software AB, a Swedish company, initially developed AxCrypt. The tool gained popularity in the 2000s and eventually transitioned to a more structured organization named AxCrypt AB."
