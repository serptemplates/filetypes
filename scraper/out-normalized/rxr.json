      "Medicalholodeck is a VR program that allows Windows VR and Meta Quest users to view, study, and manipulate medical images in 3D. Users who want to share a Medicalholodeck session with others (for example, a teacher who wants to share a session with their students) can save that session as an RXR file.",
      "Each RXR file contains a recording of not just a user's actions during a Medicalholodeck session, but also the environment in which those actions took place. Storing a recording of the entire environment allows viewers to move around that environment while they play the recording. Viewers can also manipulate items shown in the recording."
