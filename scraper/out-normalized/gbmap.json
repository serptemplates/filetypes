      "In GoreBox, players engage in a bevy of violent activities within destructible, sandbox environments. Using GoreBox's Map Editor, players can create and play in their own custom environments.",
      "GoreBox saves these custom game maps as GBMAP files (stored in the game's Maps directory). Each GBMAP file specifies the included map's name, description, and created-on date. Then, it specifies the map coordinates and materials data that GoreBox uses to display the map.",
      "Typically, players share GBMAP files with each other via GoreBox's in-game Workshop (by uploading maps to and downloading maps from the Workshop). However, players sometimes also share individual GBMAP files online, so others can download, install, and play on the maps those GBMAP files contain."
