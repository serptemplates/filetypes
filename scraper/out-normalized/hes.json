      "You will most likely only encounter HES audio files if you play TurboGrafx-16 games and enjoy the music played in the background. You may acquire an HES file by downloading it from a TurboGrafx-16 fan website or another gamer may send an HES file to you.",
      "Or you may dump a ROM from an actual TurboGrafx-16 game cartridge, then rip the music from the ROM and save it in the HES format. Takashi Mamiya created the format in 1999 and playback of HES requires emulation of the TurboGrafx-16 audio chip and CPU.",
      "You can open and play HES files with several audio players. Some of the programs include Audio Overload, Foobar2000 with the Game Emu Player plugin, and WinAmp with the NEZ plugin.",
      "NOTE: TurboGrafx-16 is a home video game console released in the late 1980s and early 1990s."
