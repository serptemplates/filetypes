      "The Kodak Photo CD system allowed users to store high-quality scanned photos on a CD for digital viewing and printing. When people had film photos developed, they could request a Kodak Picture CD, which contained scanned versions of their images in KODAK format optimized for display on computers and TVs.",
      "To view and use these files, people would insert the Kodak Picture CD into a computer and use Kodak's own software or compatible image viewers. They could then print, share, or edit the images. Some professional photographers and businesses used these CDs for archiving or sending digital proofs to clients before digital cameras became mainstream.",
      "NOTE: As digital photography advanced, KODAK files became obsolete, and users transitioned to more common formats like .JPEG and .TIFF. Many people later converted their old Kodak Picture CD images into modern formats to ensure compatibility with newer software and devices."
