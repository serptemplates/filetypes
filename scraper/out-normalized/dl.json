      "DL files are typically only seen when a user adds new game content, such as an exhibit or animal, to Zoo Tycoon 2. The file is downloaded with a .Z2F file when adding new content. Both files should be copied into the Zoo Tycoon 2 installation to add the new content properly. DL files are usually very small in file size.",
      "Zoo Tycoon 2 was released in 2004 and is the sequel to Zoo Tycoon, which was released in 2001. The purpose of the game is to build up zoo by adding exhibits and aquariums, while maintaining employees, customer and animal satisfaction, and finances."
