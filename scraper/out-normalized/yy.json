      "GameMaker Studio 2 is a multiplatform game engine developed by YoYo Games. It allows developers to create 2D video games, using drag-and-drop programming and a scripting language known as GameMaker Language.",
      "When a developer creates a new resource in GameMaker Studio 2, the program creates a corresponding YY file. This file contains metadata that GameMaker Studio 2 uses to identify and load the resource correctly. YY files are typically stored in the same folder as the resource with which they are associated.",
      "NOTE: Many YY files are paired with .GML files, which contain scripts written in GameMaker Language."
