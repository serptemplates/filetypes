      "Inspired by the Coq proof management system, developer and Twitch streamer Tsoding created the Noq (Not Coq) programming language and expression transformer. Using the Noq language, developers can write and sequentially apply rules that transform an algebraic expression. These rules, and the sequence in which they are applied, are saved in NOQ files.",
