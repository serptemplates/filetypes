      "Developers write NASM files when creating software that requires precise control over processor operations, memory, or performance. The NASM assembler assembles the source code stored in an NASM file into an object file or a final executable program, depending on the build process. The resulting output may be a standalone binary, a part of a larger program, or system-level code, such as bootloaders and operating system kernels.",
      "NASM is an open-source assembler, making it popular among students, hobbyists, and professionals who need to work with low-level programming. Users of NASM files typically include operating system developers, systems programmers, and those studying computer architecture.",
      "NOTE: NASM files are similar to .ASM files. However, ASM files are generic assembly source files that can be used with different assemblers, while NASM files are specifically written in NASM syntax for the Netwide Assembler."
