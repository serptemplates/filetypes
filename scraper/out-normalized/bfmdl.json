      "Many Nintendo Wii U video games contain and use 3D models saved in the BFMDL (short for Binary caFe MoDeL) format. In most cases, BFMDL files are stored within BFRES files, alongside textures, animations, and other data meant to be used with that model. This allows a game to efficiently load the model and related data from one archive (rather than separate locations).",
      "However, in rare cases, Wii U enthusiasts may encounter BFMDL files saved as separate files. The models these files contain are saved in the same format as the models that BFRES files contain.",
      "NOTE: Switch-Toolbox, a Nintendo file modding toolkit, can export Wii U models as BFMDL files (even if the model was originally saved within a BFRES file)."
