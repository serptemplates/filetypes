      "Developers working on apps with multiple interdependent projects or libraries may encounter XCWORKSPACEDATA files. The files enable Xcode to coordinate builds, manage dependencies, and maintain a consistent workspace environment.",
      "Specifically, XCWORKSPACEDATA files contain references to projects included in the workspace, the user interface state, window layouts, and other workspace-level configuration details. Xcode automatically generates and updates the files whenever a user creates and modifies a workspace.",
