      "To connect to a screen sharing computer for the first time, you can either 1) open the Screen Sharing application (located in /​System/​Library/​CoreServices/​), or 2) select Go → Connect to Server... in the Finder and then type vnc://ipaddress/, where \"ipaddress\" is the IP address of the remote computer with sharing turned on. VNC is the protocol used for remote desktop control.",
