      "IntelliQuilter is a motor control system that can be installed on various long-arm and mid-arm quilting machines. The IntelliQuilter system includes a tablet and software that allows quilters to import, design, and automatically stitch quilt patterns. These patterns are saved as either .DXF (Drawing Exchange Format) or IQP files.",
      "The IntelliQuilter tablet comes preloaded with several IQP files. Quilters can also download IQP files from IntelliQuilter's website and various online pattern vendors. After downloading one or more IQP files, quilters can use a USB stick to transfer the patterns to their IntelliQuilter tablet. They can also use IntelliQuilter's desktop computer software to view and/or edit their IQP files' contents."

    "instructions": [
      "In Windows, you can open IQP files with The StiQ, IntelliQuilter's paid IQP editor, or IntelliQView, IntelliQuilter's free IQP viewer. Both programs are available from IntelliQuilter's website. (You must own an IntelliQuilter system to use The StiQ.)",
      "To use an IQP file with the IntelliQuilter tablet:",
      "Plug a USB flash drive into your computer.",
      "If your flash drive does not already have a directory named patterns, create one.",
      "Transfer your IQP file to the patterns directory.",
      "Eject your USB drive.",
      "From your IntelliQuilter tablet's main menu, select Load Patterns.",
      "Connect your USB drive to your IntelliQuilter tablet.",
      "Your IntelliQuilter tablet will then import your IQP file, allowing you to access the file from the Downloads section of your pattern catalog.",
      "NOTE: IntelliQuilter always imports all IQP files stored in the patterns directory. If you don't delete IQP files from the patterns directory between imports, this can result in IntelliQuilter importing multiple copies of the same pattern. To prevent this, delete IQP files from your USB drive after importing them."
