      "Audition automatically creates an accompanying PKF file every time you import an audio file and saves it in the same location as the imported audio file. After generating a PKF file, Adobe Audition does not need to re-render a WAV file's waveform each time the file is opened. This allows Audition to load previously processed WAV files, and projects that contain them, more quickly.",
      "Adobe introduced the PKF format in Adobe Audition CS5.5. It is similar to the .PK format used by previous versions of Audition but contains floating-point data and can display waveform data for audio signals above 0dB. Since PKF files are saved in a different format than PK files, they are recognized only by Audition CS5.5 and later.",
      "NOTE: Adobe Premiere Pro also creates and uses PKF files."

      "PKF files are normally hidden from users and are not meant to be opened. Adobe Audition automatically creates or loads the correct PKF files when you import an audio file or open a project.",
      "You may delete Adobe Audition PKF files by accident or on purpose. In these cases, Audition automatically creates a replacement the next time the PKF file is needed.",
