      "SPRX files allow app and game developers to avoid manually writing code for common PS3 and Vita functions. Instead, the developers can reference relevant Sony-developed SPRX files, which they know will correctly perform the function they need. This saves developers time and allows them to create smaller apps (because they can reference SPRX files instead of adding additional code to their app).",
      "The PS3 and Vita include many SPRX files. Updates sometimes install updated or new SPRX files, which include updated or new functions that developers' apps and games might reference.",
