If you ever need to migrate or restore your WhatsApp data, you can use your CRYPT1 files to restore your downloaded stickers, chat settings, and contacts' status ranking. To do so, ensure the stickers.db.crypt1, chatsettingsbackup.db.crypt1, and statusranking.db.crypt1 files are present within your Google Drive backup or SD card when you install and log in to WhatsApp."
