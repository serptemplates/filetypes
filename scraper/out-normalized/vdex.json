      "In 2019, Google introduced the VDEX file format. The VDEX format was another iteration in Google's attempts to optimize Android apps' compilation and loading process. When a user installs an Android app, Android automatically optimizes that app and creates a corresponding .OAT and VDEX file. Referencing these files, rather than recompiling apps upon each load or update, allows Android to load apps more quickly, creating a better user experience.",
      "VDEX files contain optimized versions of previously validated DEX (Dalvik Executable) files, which Android has noted that it does not need to re-extract and re-verify when recompiling an app. VDEX files are typically stored alongside OAT files, in an Android device's /​data/​dalvik-cache directory."
