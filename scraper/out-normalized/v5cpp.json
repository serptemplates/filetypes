      "VEXcode V5 is a tool similar to MIT Scratch that provides robotics teams, educators, and hobbyists with an easy-to-use interface for programming robots. For example, users can drag and drop blocks representing code and connect them to create actions robots perform, which allows beginners to learn programming concepts without coding language knowledge.",
      "However, advanced users can switch from the block-based interface to text-based programming in VEXcode. For example, they can open the Code Viewer in VEXcode V5, choose the C++ option, and select Convert to Text Project. They can then select File → Save As to save it as a V5CPP file.",
      "NOTE: VEXcode V5 users can also code in Python and save their projects as .V5PYTHON files."

      "You can also open V5CPP files with text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows), Apple TextEdit (macOS), and gedit (Linux). However, they don't provide the same capabilities as VEXcode V5."
