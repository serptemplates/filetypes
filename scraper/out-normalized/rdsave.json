      "Rhythm Doctor is a game where players must heal patients by matching rhythmic heartbeats to move up levels and defeat boss viruses. The game typically includes four RDSAVE files: one RDSAVE settings file and three RDSAVE game save files.",
      "As you move through levels, you can save your progress in one of three save slots as slot0.rdsave, slot1.rdsave, and slot2.rdsave files. RDSAVE files storing saved game progress contain completed levels, rankings, and other related information.",
      "If the RDSAVE file stores settings (settings.rdsave), it contains information that configures the game. Examples of data include the game version, volume for music and sound effects, and game resolution."
