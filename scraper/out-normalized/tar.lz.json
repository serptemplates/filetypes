      "TAR.LZ files are similar to .TAR.LZMA files. They can be unpacked by first decompressing the file and then extracting files from the resulting tarball. This two-step process is commonly handled in one step by several file decompression utilities. There are several other instances of TAR files being compressed with separate algorithms such as .TAR.GZ, .TAR.XZ, and .TAR.BZ2."
