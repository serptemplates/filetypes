      "Radio system enthusiasts use trunk tracking scanners, like Radio Shack's PRO-97 and PRO-2055 scanners, to scan for and log activity that takes place on trunked radio systems. These systems are comprised of one or more control channels and a set of other associated frequencies. While tuned to the control channel, a user's two-way radio automatically sends and receives broadcasts from the associated (trunked) frequencies.",
      "After logging data from a trunked radio system, enthusiasts often transfer that data to associated trunk tracking software, such as Win97. They can then analyze, edit, and export the data they've collected from their trunk tracking scanner."
