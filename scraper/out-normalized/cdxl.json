      "Commodore International was an American electronics manufacturer that, among other things, was famous for producing the Commodore 64. In the 1980s and 90s, Commodore also produced the Amiga family of PCs. Later versions of the Amiga, including the CDTV, included a CD-ROM drive, and many of the CD-ROM games that could be played on an Amiga included CDXL video files.",
      "Most CDXL videos play at a low resolution and a speed of up to 24 frames per second. They can include 8-bit mono or stereo sound. Later versions of the CDXL format supported Amiga Advanced Graphics Architecture and higher video resolutions."

      "Because CDXL files are so uncommon, most popular media players cannot play them. However, you can play CDXL files in CDXL player or VLC media player. You can also convert CDXL files to a more usable video format using FFmpeg."
