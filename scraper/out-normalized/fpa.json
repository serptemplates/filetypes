      "MakeMusic Finale is a popular music notation program used by composers and other musicians. Some previous versions of the app included a Performance Assessment tool that allowed musicians to play along with a piece of sheet music, record themselves performing the song, and review their performance.",
      "The performance assessments Finale created were saved as FPA files. Each FPA file contains a copy of the sheet music a musician played along with, with notes the musician played accurately highlighted in green and notes the musician missed highlighted in red.",
      "NOTE: Finale Performance Assessment was discontinued with the release of Finale 2007."
