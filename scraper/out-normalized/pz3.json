      "Bondware Poser is a three-dimensional character design program that allows designers to create realistic 3D characters and animations for digital art, architecture, film, and video game production purposes. You will most likely only encounter a PZ3 file if you use Renderosity Poser for creating 3D scenes. You may also be sent a PZ3 file from another Poser user trying to share a scene.",
      "The PZ3 scene format is only supported by Poser software. To open a PZ3 file in Poser, select File → Open. To create a PZ3 file in Poser, select File → Save or Save As....",
      "If you receive a PZ3 file and do not have access to Poser, ask the sender to export the PZ3 in a format you can open, such as an .OBJ, .DXF, or .VRML file. To convert a PZ3 file in Poser, select File → Export.",
      "NOTE: Poser was originally developed by Smith Micro, but was sold to Bondware in June 2019."
