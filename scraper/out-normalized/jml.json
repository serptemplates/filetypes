      "JML provides a structured way to represent juggling sequences, including the timing, order, and movement of objects in a pattern. Hobbyists visualizing juggling concepts and researchers studying mathematical and physical principles behind juggling patterns are the most likely users to encounter JML files.",
      "When a user loads JML files into a juggling application, a JML file defines how the juggling motion appears, allowing them to view and adjust the pattern in real time. This makes JML a helpful format for jugglers who want to practice complex sequences, experiment with new ideas, or share patterns with others."
