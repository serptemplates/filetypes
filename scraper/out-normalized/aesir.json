      "The Locky virus is malware, known as ransomware. The purpose of the virus is to take a victim's files hostage and force them to pay the perpetrator (by way of Bitcoin) to unlock their files.",
      "The Locky virus is a trojan horse that typically enters a victim's computer through a spam email attachment. For example, the cybercriminal may send an email disguised as a notice from the victim's ISP with a .ZIP file attachment (the attachment is likely named logs_[victim_name].zip).",
      "Once the virus affects their computer, it scrambles, renames, and encrypts their files. The virus then generates three files on the user's computer desktop (and changes the desktop wallpaper):",

      "INSTRUCTION.html",

      "The files include messages informing the victim of the takeover and what they need to do to recover their files (typically by paying a Bitcoin ransom)."
