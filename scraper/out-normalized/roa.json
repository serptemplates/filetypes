      "Rivals of Aether is a 2D fighting game that is similar to Super Smash Bros. The game allows players to play against its AI or other players, locally or online. Optionally, players can save replays of their matches as ROA files. These files are text files that record each fighter's actions in the match.",
      "Players access Rivals of Aether replays by selecting Extras → Replays from the game's main menu. As a player watches a replay, they can change the replay speed, advance or rewind frame by frame, show hitboxes, and toggle the game's heads-up display."
