      "Opus format uses both SILK (used by Skype) and Xiph.Org codecs and supports variable bit rates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s. Opus extension uses the speech oriented LPC-based SILK algorithm and the lower-latency MDCT-based CELT algorithm, sometimes switching between both or sometimes by combining both algorithms to provide maximum efficiency. Files in Opus format have extension .opus. Unlike Vorbis file format, large codebooks are not required by Opus for each individual file, that is the reason why this format is comparatively efficient.",
      "The Opus codec is used for Voice over IP (VoIP), video conferencing, and in-game chat. The Opus format was standardized by the IETF and is maintained by Xiph.Org.",
      "Since the Opus codec is primarily used for streaming, actual OPUS files are not common."
