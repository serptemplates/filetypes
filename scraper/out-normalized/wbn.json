      "In the interest of making websites and web apps easier to share and open offline, developers within WICG, an offshoot of the World Wide Web Consotrium (W3C), created the WBN format. Saving a website in the WBN format packages all that website's files into a single file, which a user can then share over Bluetooth, Wi-Fi, or a local network. Theoretically, other users can then open the WBN file in their web browser to access the website it contains, without connecting to the Internet.",
      "Each WBN file is a renamed Concise Binary Object Representation (CBOR) file, which uses the .wbn extension instead of the .cbor extension. CBOR files are similar to .JSON files, except they store data primarily in a binary format, rather than as plain text.",
      "NOTE: Google removed Chrome's support for WBN files in February 2023. It is possible that Google may restore Chrome's support for WBN files in the future."
