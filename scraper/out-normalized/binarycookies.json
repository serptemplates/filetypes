      "The BINARYCOOKIES file format stores details such as selected language, theme settings, login tokens, and other user-specific information. It also includes expiration dates, determining how long each cookie remains active.",
      "On iOS, each app that uses a web view (such as SafariViewController or WKWebView) typically has its own separate BINARYCOOKIES file. These files are stored in the app's private directory, while the operating system manages Safari's BINARYCOOKIES separately.",
      "NOTE: iOS apps that include embedded web views are mobile applications on iPhones and iPads that display web content directly within the app using a built-in browser window (rather than opening Safari or another external browser)."
