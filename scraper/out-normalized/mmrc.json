      "MADRIX is a German company that sells professional-grade LED lighting controls. Combined, MADRIX's hardware and software allow lighting operators to design and control sophisticated LED displays, used at concerts, clubs, and other venues.",
      "MADRIX's lighting control software includes a tool called the MIDI Remote Editor. The MIDI Remote Editor allows lighting operators to create sets of pre-programmed commands they can use to control lighting installations. Operators then associate these commands, saved within an MMRC file, with the buttons on a MIDI remote control. Using their remotes, operators can easily synchronize lighting sequences with other elements of an event or display, including audio and video."
