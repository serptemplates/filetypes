      "Microsoft MakeCode is a free online platform that students use to create simple programs. Primarily, MakeCode allows amateur developers to create programs using block-based code editing tools. (Developers can also code in JavaScript.)",
      "By default, MakeCode saves users' projects to their web browser's local storage. These project directories contain at least the four following basic project files:",
      "Main.ts: Contains the project's JavaScript source code",

      "Pxt.json: Contains project dependency information",
      "README.md: Contains readme information",
