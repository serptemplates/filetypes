      "The code of WavPack is portable and compatible with Unix, Mac OS, and Windows. Plugins for different applications are available for WV files. It can be used on many architectures like x86 and Motorola 68k. This type of compression is compatible with most PCM formats of audio.\n\nSome of these are 8,16 and 32-bit recordings. Sometimes WVC files are included as companions with the WV files. These audio files are compatible to be used on almost all media players currently used along with the requirement of an external codec Of WavPack.\n\nThe hybrid mode in WV solves the issue of having to choose between a small file with low quality and a compressed file with high quality. Rather than creating one single file, the hybrid mode creates a high-quality file with a small size that can be easily used on its own and a combination of this with a lossy file, gives the “correction” file. This combination provides a chance to make a full restoration without loss. This hybrid mode works on about 196 kbps in the case of CD audio or 2.25 bits per sample.",
      "WavPack compression supports mono, stereo, and multichannel audio. It is compatible with most PCM audio formats including 8, 16, 24, and 32-bit recordings, and supports sampling rates from 6 to 192 kHz."
