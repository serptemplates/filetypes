      "QPX extensions function similarly to plugins, which third-party vendors or Apple developed to integrate into QuickTime Player, allowing the software to expand its media playback capabilities without requiring a full program update. The files were typically small in size, so users could more easily add or remove them based on their needs.",
      "QPX extensions were beneficial during QuickTime Player's earlier years in the late 1990s and 2000s when compatibility with emerging media standards and formats frequently required extensions. However, the media player no longer supports QPX files."
