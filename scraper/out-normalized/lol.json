      "NOTE: LOLCODE is referred to as an esoteric programming language since its syntax is considered humorous and its usefulness is limited. It is not a robust language such as C, C++, Java, or Python. Therefore, it is usually used for writing simple proof-of-concept and hobbyist applications. LOLCODE is popular with some hacker communities."
