      "If you are using Trainz Railroad Simulator 2006 (TRS2006), you can use the Content Manager Plus (CMP) module included with the simulator to decompress TEXTURE files. However, if you are using Trainz Railroad Simulator 2009 (TRS2009) or later, you can no longer perform this function with the CMP module.",
      "You can also utilize various third-party tools to decompress TEXTURE files and split the text and images stored in the file into a .TXT file and the texture image file(s). Some utilities include two versions of PEVsoft's Images2TGA utility (32- & 64-bit) as well as the Texture2TGA_con.exe utility, which is rare. Some Trainz assets require a specific version of these utilities, with most only needing the older 32-bit Images2TGA utility, while some more recent assets that utilize advanced and newer imaging capabilities need the other.",
      "After splitting the text and images compressed in a TEXTURE file, you can modify the key-value pair text with a text editor and the JPEG, TGA, or BMP texture images with an image editor, such as GIMP, IrfanView, or Adobe Photoshop."
