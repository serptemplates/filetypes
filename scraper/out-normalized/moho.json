      "Since MOHO files store animation projects, they are the most well known files among Moho users. You can create a MOHO file by selecting File → New or New From Template then saving it by selecting File → Save or Save As.... To open a MOHO file, simply select File → Open... or Open Recent... and select the MOHO file.",
      "MOHO files were originally created by early versions of Moho. However, the file was replaced by the .ANME file when Moho became Anime Studio. Eventually, in version 12, Anime Studio was renamed as Moho, which uses the MOHO file to store projects. Current versions of Moho still support ANME files."
