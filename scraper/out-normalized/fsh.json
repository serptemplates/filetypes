      "GLSL is a high-level shading language utilized by Open Graphics Library OpenGL, which is an application programming interface (API) that renders 2D and 3D graphics. Various applications utilize OpenGL, including Google Earth, Minecraft, and Adobe Photoshop.",
      "FSH files contain data that shades a fragment, which is a pixel in a rasterized triangle that makes up a 3D image. When rendered by the GPU, the code in the FSH file determines the color (includes the saturation, hue, brightness, and contrast) of the pixels in the graphics.",
      "NOTE: Fragment shaders differ from vertex shaders (.VSH and .VERT files), which store vertex code required to manipulate the position of the triangle mesh vertices that make up a 3D model."
