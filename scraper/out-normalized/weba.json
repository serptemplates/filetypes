      "WebM is an open, royalty-free container format used to share videos on the web. Google developed WebM to serve as an alternative to the H.264 and H.265 video formats. Typically, WEBM files contain both video and audio data. However, some WEBM files contain only audio data. These files may be referred to as WEBA files.",
      "Often, WEBA files are created by extracting a WEBM file's audio data and saving it as a separate file. On rarer occasions, a user may create a WEBA file by saving only audio data in the WEBM format. You are most likely to encounter a WEBA file when downloading audio from the Internet, as the WebM format is used primarily to embed and share media online.",
      "You can use FFmpeg (cross-platform) to convert the audio your WEBA file contains to a variety of other audio formats. For example, you can use FFmpeg to convert your WEBA file to an .MP3 file, so you can open it in additional media players."

You can also play the audio a WEBA file contains by dragging the file to your web browser, provided you use Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Mozilla Firefox, or Opera. (In some cases, you may have to change your WEBA file's extension to .webm to open it.)",

      "WEBA files can be converted to other audio file formats. As it is based on the free and open-source OGG container file format, many APIs and applications that can read and convert WEBA to other file formats such as MP3, MP4, FLAC, and many others. FFmpeg is one such software that can convert WEBA to an MP3 file."
