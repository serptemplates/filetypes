      "Animate is an application available with the Creative Cloud (CC). Designers and developers may use the software to create animations for various contexts, including the web, TV, and games.",
      "As you create your animation with Animate, you can save it as an XFL file to preserve your progress. While you will likely save the animation as a packaged FLA file, you can save it as an XFL file if you want access to the components of the animation. To save an animation as an XFL file with Animate, select File → Save As..., then choose \"Animate Uncompressed Document\" from the \"File Format\" dropdown menu.",
      "After saving the XFL file, Animate creates a folder named after the animation that stores the XFL file and the animation's assets. Some items include bin, LIBRARY, and META-INF folders and assets (bitmap graphics, audio files, etc.). The folder also contains various .XML files, such as a MobileSettings.xml file (contains mobile settings) and a PublishSettings.xml file (contains publish settings).",
