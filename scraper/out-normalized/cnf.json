      "MySQL is an RDBMS that stores and organizes data for web applications, software systems, and other services. The RDBMS reads the CNF file at startup to apply the specified settings, which can influence performance, resource usage, and compatibility.",
      "Database administrators and developers may modify CNF files to optimize MySQL for specific workloads, such as high-traffic websites or data-heavy applications. For example, a developer or administrator might adjust buffer sizes to improve read/write speeds or set logging preferences to monitor system behavior. While casual users rarely interact with CNF files, those managing MySQL installations or troubleshooting database issues rely on this file to configure and tune the system effectively."
