      "ETC Eos is a family of theater lighting control hardware that runs accompanying control software, also named Eos. Using the Eos software, lighting designers can design, save, and run theater lighting sequences, referred to as shows.",
      "Version 3 of Eos includes a feature named Augment3d, which allows lighting designers to create and program within a 3D representation of their theater lighting rig. When a designer saves a show file that contains Augment3d data, that show is saved as an ESF3D file. Optionally, if a designer wants to save their show without its Augmet3d data, they can instead save the show as an .ESF2 file."
