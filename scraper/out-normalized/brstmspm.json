      "Super Paper Mario is an action role-playing game for the Nintendo Wii. Like other Nintendo Wii games, it uses audio files saved in the BRSTM format, with the .brstm file extension.",
      "However, Super Paper Mario's BRSTM files are formatted slightly differently than other BRSTM files. Thus, when played with tools that use the vgmstream video game music playing library, the files play too quickly.",
      "To account for this difference, vgmstream is coded to recognize files with the .brstmspm extension as Super Paper Mario BRSTM files. This allows gamers to play the files correctly simply by renaming them to use the .brstmspm extension."
