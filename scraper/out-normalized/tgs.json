      "TGS files are not meant to be opened with Telegram. Instead, the files are typically only used by Telegram users creating their own animated sticker packs to be added to the messaging service. If you created a TGS animated sticker pack, you must send the /​newanimated command to the @stickers bot, then send the TGS files with a 100x100 pixels icon to successfully upload the pack to Telegram. After completing the upload you can use and share the sticker pack.",
