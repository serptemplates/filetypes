      "VEGAS Pro (formerly Sony Vegas) provides various tools for manipulating video and audio. As you work on a production in VEGAS Pro, you can save your progress as a VEG file, which allows you to close and re-open it for further editing.",
      "Besides projects, VEGAS Pro also saves video templates and archives as VEG files. The VEG file format remains the same in these cases, but their purpose differs.",
      "For example, you can save your project as a VEG template to maintain the same settings across different projects. Another example is when you save a VEG file as an archive, you can keep backups of projects that you can open later. Select File → Export → VEGAS Project Archive to save your project as an archive.",
      "NOTE: Sony previously developed VEGAS software before MAGIX acquired it in 2016."
