      "A QPM file is a data file created by Quick Pallet Maker (QPM), a software tool designed to optimize pallet loading for shipping and storage. It contains plain text information about a pallet, including primary package dimensions, box configurations, and pallet settings, which help users determine the most efficient way to arrange products on a pallet to maximize space and minimize shipping costs."

    "content": [
      "Businesses that need to plan and improve their packaging and logistics are the primary users of Quick Pallet Maker and QPM files. Users can generate pallet layouts that comply with shipping requirements by inputting product dimensions and packaging rules and save them as QPM files. They can then close and re-open the files to adjust and recalculate the pallet based on different package sizes or shipping constraints."

      "You can open QPM files with Quick Pallet Maker in Windows and macOS. To open a QPM file with the software, select File → Open.",
      "Since QPM files are saved in a plain text format, you can also open them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows), Apple TextEdit (macOS), gedit (Linux). However, opening the files with a text editor will not appear the same as opening them with Quick Pallet Maker."
