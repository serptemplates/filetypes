      "A VIBE file is a data file created by SensationSoft VibePlayer, an audio and video player for Android that allows users to feel vibrations from the device while media is played. It contains haptic data that syncs with an audio or video file, such as an .MP3 or .MP4 file, so that when the media is played in the app the user can feel the physical vibrations through the device. VIBE files are used to enhance the experience of a user watching or listening to media in VibePlayer."

      "VibePlayer allows users to create VIBE files that sync with audio or video files, which when played back, vibrate at the appropriate times. For example, a user can tap in the VibePlayer app when certain notes are played in a song or sound effects are played in a movie to create vibrations that are saved in the VIBE file. After the file is created, it is placed in the same folder as the media file to which it is associated. When a user plays the media file in VibePlayer, the app also loads the VIBE file to play alongside the media file.",
      "A VIBE file bears the same name as the media file it's associated with but with the .vibe extension appended to it. For example, if the VIBE file is associated with example.mkv, the file is named example.mkv.vibe.",
      "NOTE: While VIBE files are meant to be played by VibePlayer, they can be edited by a text editor since the data is stored in plain text."
