      "A G3M file is a data file saved in the G3M format used by fx-CG Prizm series graphing calculators. It may contain various types of data, including an entire C.Basic or Casio Basic program or a single spreadsheet with list, table, matrix, and graph data. G3M files are typically stored in the storage or main memory directories of a graphing calculator."
