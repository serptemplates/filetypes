      "You can open RPMSG files with Microsoft Outlook. For example, if you receive a protected email message with the message.rpmsg file attached, you can click the RPMSG file in Outlook to open the file (only while logged in to the email account that initially received the message). You can also select File → Open if you are using the desktop version of Outlook.",
      "If you use an email client other than Outlook, such as Gmail, you will be redirected to a separate Microsoft Outlook webpage when you click the message.rpmsg file attachment. You are then prompted to sign in to your Gmail account to verify your identity, then must click Allow. After successfully signing in, you can view the protected message via the Microsoft Outlook webpage in the new tab.",
      "Besides the Outlook email client, you can open RPMSG files with the Microsoft Azure Information Protection app on Android and iOS devices."
