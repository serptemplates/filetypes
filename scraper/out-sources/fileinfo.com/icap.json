      "An ICAP file is a package created by Adobe InDesign for use in Adobe InCopy, a writing and editing application. It stores an .ICMA file and associated .ICML files in a compressed archive. ICAP files are used to store subsections of InDesign documents, such as a text or graphics frame, for remote editing by an InCopy user."

      "Adobe developed the ICAP format for when InCopy and InDesign users work collaboratively via ICMA assignment files but do not have access to a common server where the ICMA files are stored. The users may not have the correct permissions, access to the Internet, etc.",
      "An InDesign user can create and distribute an ICAP package that stores the ICMA assignment files to an InCopy user. The InCopy user can then edit it with InCopy, re-package it as an .IDAP file, and send it back to the InDesign user to import it into the original .INDD document using InDesign.",
