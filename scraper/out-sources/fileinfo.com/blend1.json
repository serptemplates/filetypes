      "A BLEND1 file is a backup file automatically generated by Blender, a free 3D modeling program. It stores a copy of the previously saved version of the currently opened .BLEND file and is used for recovering the previous version of a BLEND file. BLEND1 files can be renamed with the \".blend\" extension and opened normally."
