      "DivX Author is a video creation program that allows users to create DivX-encoded movies, better known as DIVX files. As part of creating movies, users can create, load, and apply DVD background and menu templates saved in TDA3MT files. This allows users to create DivX DVDs.",
      "You can play DivX DVDs that include TDA3MT-based menus on any DivX Certified device and in DivX Player. However, only DivX Ultra Certified devices and DivX Player 9 and lower will process the file's TDA3MT menu. Other devices and players will ignore the menu and instead simply begin playing the disc's video content."
