      "An XWMC file is a settings file used by Xaero's World Map, a Minecraft mod that adds an interactive world map to the game. It stores map settings for a world in the Xaero’s World Map Configuration (XWMC) format. XWMC files include custom waypoints, zoom levels, and map display options specific to each Minecraft world a user explores with the mod."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "When you play Minecraft with Xaero’s World Map installed, the mod automatically generates XWMC files in your Minecraft directory within the config/​XaeroWorldMap folder, along with .XAERO Map Data files. Then, the mod references XWMC files to load your preferences and customizations for individual worlds or servers, so each world can have its own map settings without affecting others."
