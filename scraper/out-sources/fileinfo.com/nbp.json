    "description": [
      "An NBP file is a published notebook (.NB) created by Wolfram Research Mathematica to store analysis results as an interactive document. It stores all of the elements that comprise a notebook, such as text, graphics, sound, calculations, diagrams, and user interface components. Mathematica no longer develops the NBP format; users publish notebooks in the NB format."

    "content": [
      "Mathematica is a program for performing scientific and mathematical computations. NBP files are similar to NB files, but are \"signed\" for the purpose of playing with the free Mathematica Player. Both file types are saved using 7-bit ASCII text."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open NBP files with Wolfram Research Mathematica. To open an NBP file, select File → Open. Wolfram Research Player is a free app that can also open NBP files.",
      "Since NBP files store plain text, you can view them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad in Windows, Apple TextEdit in macOS, or gedit in Linux. However, opening NB files with a text editor will not display them the same as Mathematica or Wolfram Player, which displays them natively."
