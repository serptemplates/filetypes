      "A SER file contains a series of frame captures saved in the Lucam video format, which is used to store astronomical captures, such as planets, the sun, and the moon. It stores data about image frames and includes metadata, such as timestamps, exposure time, instrument, telescope, and observer."

      "SER files were originally created by only Lumenera and DMK cameras. However, as the SER format became more widespread, more digital cameras and programs adopted the format. SER files may be opened by a variety of programs, such as SER Player, FireCapture, ImagesPlus, RegiStax, SER-Reader, and PIPP.",
      "There are several iterations of the SER format with the first two versions only supporting monochrome images. However, version 3 provides support for color images."
