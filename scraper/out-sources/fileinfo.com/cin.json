    "description": [
      "A CIN file is a bitmap image saved in the Cineon (CIN) format, which Kodak developed to transfer film images to a digital format for electronic compositing, manipulation, and enhancement. It stores a single frame from a motion picture or video data stream and supports 10-bit color depth per RGB channel. Kodak's Cineon System system may create CIN files, along with other third-party applications, such as Adobe Photoshop or XnViewMP."

    "content": [
      "Kodak released its Cineon System in 1992, with Hollywood studios primarily using it to restore old films and convert them to digital format. Film artists used the Cineon system to scan film, saving each frame as a CIN file. They then modified the frames digitally with software included with Cineon System and output them back to film via the Cineon System recorder with no loss of image quality.",
      "While the Cineon System is no longer in use (discontinued in the late 1990s as Kodak introduced the .DPX format), the format has persisted. Therefore, you may still encounter CIN files if you are a visual effects artist."
