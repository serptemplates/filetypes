      "A TS file is a video file saved in the Video Transport Stream (TS) format, which stores video data compressed with standard MPEG-2 (.MPEG) video compression. The TS format is often used to save video on a DVD disc but may also store streamed or broadcast video. Many video players can play and convert TS files to other formats, including VideoLAN VLC media player and Corel VideoStudio."
