      "Invitations to a meeting can be sent by email or instant message. When a user creates an invitation, the WCINV file is generated by Windows Meeting Space to store the invitation. The invitation can then be shared to other users and when they double-click the WCINV file, Windows Meeting Space is opened and they are brought to join the meeting.",
      "Windows Meeting Space was only used in Windows Vista and was replaced by Microsoft Office Live Meeting in Windows 7. The program featured collaborative editing, file sharing, instant messaging, and desktop sharing. Windows Meeting Space was also known as Windows Collaboration and Windows Shared View."
