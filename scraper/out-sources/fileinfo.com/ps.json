      "A PS file is an image saved in the PostScript page description language. It can contain text, vector graphics, and raster images, and it is primarily designed to describe the layout of a page for printing. PostScript files are typically processed by a Raster Image Processor (RIP) on PostScript-compatible printers, allowing the printers to print them directly without the need for the user to open them in a conventional application."

    "content": [
      "Adobe Systems developed PostScript in the early 1980s to simplify the process of converting text and graphics into printed pages. Designers, journalists, and publishers use the format to maintain precise layouts across different computers and printers. Over time, newer formats like .PDF have become more prevalent, but professional printing workflows and graphic design environments still use PS files.",
      "The primary benefits of PostScript are its ability to accurately preserve page layouts and scale images and text without loss of quality. However, the format is not as widely supported by general software today, making it more difficult for casual users to view or edit PS files. Additionally, PostScript files can be large and complex, which increases processing and loading times."
