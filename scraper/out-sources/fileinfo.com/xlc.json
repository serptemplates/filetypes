      "Before Microsoft ended support for the XLC format, you could generate a chart by selecting data in a Microsoft Excel spreadsheet, then choosing Insert → Chart within Excel. You could then save the chart within an Excel spreadsheet (.XLS file) or separately as an XLC file.",
      "You can still create charts within Excel by selecting Insert → Recommended Charts, and then adjust their settings in the \"Chart Design\" tab. Instead of allowing you to save the charts in a separate XLC file, Excel saves the chart in the spreadsheet.",
