      "The \"crypt8\" extension is commonly appended to a .DB file to create the .DB.CRYPT8 file, which is used by WhatsApp to secure a user's message database on his or her Android device. For each new installment, the application uses a different algorithm to encrypt the DB files. The extension appended to the DB file, such as \"crypt6\" or \"crypt7\", signifies the algorithm.",
