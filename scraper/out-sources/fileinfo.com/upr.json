      "Since the UPR format saves fractal parameters rather than a bitmap, it allows the fractal image to be rendered mathematically and zoomed without loss of quality. Programs that render UPR files generally can save any view within the fractal image as a raster graphic such as a .PNG, .JPG, or .BMP file.",
