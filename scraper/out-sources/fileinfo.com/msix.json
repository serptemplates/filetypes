      "To open an MSIX file and begin installing the packaged app in Windows 10 or higher, double-click the file. App Installer opens the MSIX file and shows information about the app, such as its name, publisher, version, and requested capabilities. Follow the prompts in App Installer to complete the installation. MSIX packages are extracted to the ProgramFiles\\​WindowApps directory.",
      "If you want to examine an MSIX file's contents instead of installing the packaged app, you can extract the contents using a Zip decompression utility, such as Corel WinZip or RARLAB WinRAR. To extract the contents, change the .msix file extension to .zip, then extract the files using the Zip decompression program. Make sure to change the .zip file extension back to .msix before installing the app."
