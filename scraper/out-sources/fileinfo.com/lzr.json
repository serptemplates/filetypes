      "An LZR file is an .LBR archive that has been compressed using Crunch compression. It typically contains several related files, such as a software program and its documentation, that have been packaged together for distribution. To retrieve the files an LZR file contains, users need both a Crunch decompression utility and a LU expansion utility."

      "Developer Gary P. Novosielski created the LU archiving utility in the early 1980s, for use with the CP/M and DOS operating systems. Primarily, developers use LU to package software programs in LBR files, for distribution to end users. Notably, however, LBR files are not compressed.",
      "To share LBR files more efficiently, developers often compress the files using a compression utility. LBR files that are Crunch-compressed are typically renamed to use the .lzr extension.",
