      "A BBC file contains BBC BASIC source code, which is a version of the BASIC programming language originally developed for the BBC Microcomputer in the 1980s. Developers can write and edit BBC files using the BBC BASIC development environment or any plain text editor. Once the code is complete, developers compile the BBC file into a standalone .EXE file with BBC BASIC."
