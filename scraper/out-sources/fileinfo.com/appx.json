      "You can install any APPX file on a Windows PC by double-clicking it. Since APPX files install software, do not double-click any APPX file before verifying its legitimacy and source.",
      "If you want to view the constituent files an APPX file contains, you can attempt to extract the files using a Zip decompression utility. APPX files are Zip-compressed files, so tools like 7-Zip (Windows), Corel WinZip (Windows, Mac), and B1 Free Archiver (cross-platform) can extract the files APPX files contain. However, because APPX files are formatted slightly differently than normal Zip files, you may a) have to change your APPX file's extension to .zip to expand it and b) encounter some errors when extracting files."
