      "An HCA file contains audio compressed in the High Compression Audio proprietary codec and saved in the ADX2 format, which is the second version of the ADX format developed by CRI Middleware. It is used to store compressed audio, typically background music, for various video games, such as Phantasy Star Online 2. HCA files are commonly bundled into an .ACB or .AWB audio package file."

      "One significant improvement of the ADX2 format over the ADX format is that music tracks can be layered to play multiple tracks of music at the same time. The ADX2 format is developed by CRI Middleware, a Japanese company that specializes in audio and video software in the entertainment industry."
