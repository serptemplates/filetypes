      "MPEG-2 Transport (TSP) video file created by a DVR such as a DISH Network DVR; contains a recorded TV show or movie saved to the DVR's hard drive; can use different encoding formats for the audio and video streams and therefore may be difficult to decode or play on a standard software video player."
