      "You can open RAR files with RARLAB WinRAR (Windows) and RARLAB RAR (Android). For example, to open a RAR file with RARLAB WinRAR, select File → Open archive.",

      "Corel WinZip Mac (Mac)",
      "B1 Free Archiver (cross-platform)",
      "PeaZip (cross-platform)",
      "If your RAR archive is split into a multi-volume archive (e.g. you possess a .rar file, an .r01 file, an .r02 file, and so on), you can extract all the files included within the multi-volume archive by opening the archive's primary RAR file with a decompression utility. Note that, for this to work, all the files contained within the multi-volume archive must be stored in the same folder. Also, you must possess every file included in the archive (e.g. if you have an .r03 file and an .r05 file but not an .r04 file, you may have trouble extracting your files).",
      "Some RAR archives may be password-protected. To open these archives, you must enter the password used to create the archive when prompted."
