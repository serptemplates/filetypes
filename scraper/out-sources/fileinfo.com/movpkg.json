      "MOVPKG files are meant to be opened in the Apple media application that created them. For example, a MOVPKG file downloaded via Apple Music is meant to be opened and played in Apple Music.",
      "However, some other applications can play MOVPKG files. For example, the AVPlayer media player for iPhone can play MOVPKG files, provided your MOVPKG file is not encrypted.",
      "You may also be able to play the media a MOVPKG file contains by opening its M3U8 file in a media player that supports M3U8 files, such as VideoLAN VLC media player (cross-platform). Again, this will work only if the media your MOVPKG file contains is not encrypted."
