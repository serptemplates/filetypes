      "A CSHTML file is a C# HTML webpage file used by Razor, an ASP.NET view engine that generates webpages. It is similar to a standard ASP.NET webpage (.ASP or .ASPX file) but uses slightly different syntax. CSHTML files run on a web server, which generates HTML for a client web browser."

      "CSHTML files are similar to .VBHTML (Visual Basic HTML) files. However, they use syntax that is closer to the C# language than the Visual Basic language.",
      "One easy way to recognize a CSHTML file is to look for @ symbols that precede Razor reserved directives and code blocks. CSHTML files use the @ symbol and Razor reserved directives to transition from HTML markup to C# code.",
      "Most CSHTML files are created in Microsoft Visual Studio. Visual Studio provides syntax highlighting and Intellisense code suggestions that help developers create CSHTML files.",
      "NOTE: Razor offers additional templating syntax operations besides those supported by the standard ASP.NET MVC default view engine."
