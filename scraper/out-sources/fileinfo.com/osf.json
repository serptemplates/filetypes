      "An OSF file is a Zip-compressed package for distributing backups, maps, and plugins for OsmAnd, a GPS navigation application for Android and iOS devices. For example, OsmAnd users often share plugins, which consist of .JSON files and folders with other resource files, as OSF files that other users can import into the app to extend its functionality."
