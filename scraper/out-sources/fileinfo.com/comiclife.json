      "A COMICLIFE file is a document created by Comic Life, an application used to create comic books, scripts, picture albums, and other visual documents. It stores one or more pages with custom layouts, which include text and images. COMICLIFE files replaced .CL2DOC files as the default format for saving documents in Comic Life with the release of version 3."

      "You can begin your document from scratch or from one of the templates that come with Comic Life. The program gives you tools for designing the layout of your document and allows you to add text and shapes to make your story come alive. You can also apply various effects and filters to the different document elements.",
      "When you save a project in Comic Life, the program creates the COMICLIFE file and stores the project information in the file. The COMICLIFE file allows you to close your project and continue working on it at later time. When you are finished with your work you can share it to Facebook or email directly from Comic Life. You can also export the document to a variety of formats, such as .PDF, .EPUB, .JPG, .GIF, .PNG, .TIFF, and .CBZ files."
