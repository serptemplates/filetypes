      "A CVX file is a drawing file created by various Canvas GFX applications, such as Canvas X Draw (Windows version only) and Canvas X Geo, programs used to create technical illustrations and other drawings. It may contain both raster and vector graphics and include project drawing settings such as layers and image effects. Canvas X Draw (Windows version only) and Canvas X Geo save drawings as CVX files by default."

Examples of drawings you can create with Canvas X applications include room floorplans, workflow diagrams for a project, and a public park (with its geospatial data).",
      "ACD Systems introduced CVX files when they released version 9 of Canvas in 2003.
