      "An EVRC file is an audio file saved in the Enhanced Variable Rate Codec (EVRC) format. It contains a human voice recording or ringtone from a cellular phone, such as a Sony Ericsson, Qualcomm, or Kyocera phone. EVRC files are used by code-division multiple access (CDMA) networks, which is part of many mobile phone standards."

      "You most likely will not come across an EVRC file since the EVRC speech codec was replaced in cellular phones. EVRC was succeeded by Selectable Mode Vocoder (SMV), which was then replaced by 4GV."
