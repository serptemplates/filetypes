      "An XI file is an instrument used by various audio tracker apps, including Triton Fasttracker 2 and Milkytracker. It stores information about an instrument, such as a kick drum or piano, in the Extended Instrument (XI) format, which is similar to the .XM module format. XI files include envelope and LFO settings and one or more WAVE samples (one per channel)."
