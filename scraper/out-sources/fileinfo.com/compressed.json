      "A COMPRESSED file is a webpage created by WordCompress, a WordPress plug-in used to compress HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code. It contains a single line of code that represents a webpage. Converting WordPress webpages to COMPRESSED files allows browsers to load those pages more quickly."

    "content": [
      "WordCompress was a WordPress plug-in that deleted all comments and white space within a webpage's source code and wrote the code to a single executable line. This allowed web browsers to load the page more quickly. Each webpage's compressed code was saved within a COMPRESSED file.",
      "WordPress and WordCompress store COMPRESSED files alongside webpages' original source code. That way, any comments, indentations, and other white space included in the page's original source code are not destroyed when it is converted to a COMPRESSED file."
