      "An OSB file contains a storyboard created by osu!, a game of rhythm where players tap visual cues in sync with music. It stores the directory path of an image, typically a .JPG or .PNG file, that is displayed with an .OSZ Beatmap file during gameplay. It also includes plain text information that describes when and where the image is displayed in the background depending on how the player performs."
