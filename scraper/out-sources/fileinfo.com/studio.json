      "A STUDIO file is a design project created by Silhouette Studio, a program used to design items that can be cut with a Silhouette electronic cutting machine. It contains a design, which may include shapes, images, text, lines, colors, gradients, patterns, and effects. STUDIO files also store design page settings, cut settings, and registration marks."

      "The STUDIO file was the primary file associated with versions 1 and 2 of Silhouette Studio. When you would create and save a design project, the STUDIO file was the default format used to store the design.",
      "However, with the release of version 3 of Silhouette Studio, the STUDIO file has been replaced by the .STUDIO3 file. The STUDIO file is still supported by version 3 of Silhouette Studio. You can also save your design as a STUDIO file, although this may leave some advanced features unsaved."
