      "A CEC file is an upgrade file used by Studio C Alpha, the animatronic late-night talk show installation found at some Chuck E. Cheese restaurants starting in 1997. It is used to reconfigure how Studio C Alpha's lights and animatronic character behave. Typically, CEC files are stored on Chuck E. Cheese-branded floppy disks, which shipped alongside laserdiscs and DVDs that contained new Studio C Alpha video content."

      "Studio C Alpha was a Chuck E. Cheese attraction that featured an animatronic version of Chuck E. Cheese hosting a late-night talk show. In addition to the animatronic version of Mr. Cheese, Studio C Alpha featured lights, sounds, and video content, such as guest interviews.",
      "Intermittently, Chuck E. Cheese would change the content that played in Studio C Alpha. To reprogram how the attraction's animatronic character and lights behaved, a staff member would install upgrade files stored on a floppy disk. Some of these upgrade files were saved as CEC files. Eventually, both the upgrade and video content used to change how Studio C Alpha behaved were stored on USB flash drives."
