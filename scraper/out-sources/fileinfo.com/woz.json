      "A WOZ file is a disk image saved in the WOZ binary format, which contains program data in the same structure as an Apple II, or Apple ][, floppy disk. It also stores metadata about the disk image, such as the disk name, publisher, language, and system requirements. WOZ files are typically used for Apple II games, utilities, and educational programs."

      "The WOZ format, which is named after Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak, was released in 2018 and came from the Applesauce project. It is developed by John K. Morris with the purpose of providing a simple disk image format that accurately stores data as it is encoded in an Apple II floppy disk. WOZ files can be opened by emulators, such as MAME and OpenEmulator."
