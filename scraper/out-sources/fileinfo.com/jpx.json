      "A JPX file is an image saved in the part-2 extension to the JPEG 2000 format. It stores image data compressed with lossy or lossless compression and supports image transparency and retains alpha and spot channels. JPX files may also contain additional metadata that describes the contents of the file."

      "JPEG 2000 was created in 2000 by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) committee to replace the JPEG format. The group also released a part 2 extension to the format that supports additional features, such as the composition of multiple code streams into one image and animations. Images saved in the part-2 extension to the format typically have the .jpx extension.",
      "JPX files typically contain digital photographs. However, they may also store other types of images, such as medical scans or satellite map images.",
      "NOTE: Most JPEG 2000 images are saved as .JP2 files, but they may also be saved as JPX and .JPF files."
