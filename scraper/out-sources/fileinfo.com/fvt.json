      "An FVT file is a video file saved in the Fast Search & Transfer (FAST) format, a multimedia compression and streaming technology introduced in 1997. It contains video compressed using a proprietary video compression scheme and audio compressed using Linear predictive coding (LPC). FVT files are used for live video streaming over wireless networks and local and on-demand video playback."

    "content": [
      "FVT files are supported by the FAST Search & Transfer ASA Java applet player, which was used in select web browsers to download, decompress, and display play FAST video. FVT files are also supported by the Fast Search & Transfer ASA EPOC native code player. The EPOC operating system became Symbian OS in 1998.",
      "NOTE: FAST was eventually purchased by Microsoft in 2008 and used as a high-speed search engine system for enterprise searches. FVT files are no longer used."
