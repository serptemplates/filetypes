      "Because the mobile devices that included the Mophun game platform are now outdated or obsolete, there is no easy way to open an MPN file and play the game it contains. While some Mophun emulators exist, they are either incomplete or available only for legacy devices, such as Windows Phones. The easiest way to play an MPN game is to install the game on an old device that includes the Mophun platform."
