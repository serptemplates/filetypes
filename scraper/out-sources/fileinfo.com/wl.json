    "description": [
      "A WL file contains functions or other inputs in the Wolfram Language, a programming language that Wolfram Research Mathematica can run to perform calculations, solve equations, and manipulate data. Users typically open and edit WL files with Mathematica or the Wolfram Workbench IDE but may also open them with text editors since the files store plain text. Wolfram introduced WL files in Mathematica 10, replacing .M files."

      "Mathematica users, including researchers, scientists, and data analysts, can perform various mathematical and scientific computations to manipulate and visualize data. Users can save the computations as Wolfram Language Packs (WL files) and organize them within Mathematica Notebook (.NB) files to create data analysis visualizations and other outputs.",
      "Mathematica automatically loads default WL files when a user runs the software to allow users to access the inputs. Users can also load other WL files included with the app to access their inputs or create their WL files with Mathematica or the Wolfram Workbench IDE, then load those files in Mathematica.",
      "NOTE: WL files are the same as the M files they replaced but bear the .wl file extension to set them apart from other file types that use the .m extension."

      "You can open WL files with Wolfram Research Mathematica and Wolfram Workbench (an Eclipse-based IDE used with Mathematica). With these applications, you can view and edit the Wolfram Language in the WL files. To open a WL file with Mathematica, select File → Open.",
      "While most people open WL files with Mathematica or Workbench, you can also open and edit WL files with source code or text editors. Examples include Microsoft Visual Studio Code, Microsoft Notepad, and Apple TextEdit."
