      "VBM files may be included with VBK and VRB backup files. While they are not necessary to restore a backup, they provide much faster performance during the backup because they store cached information that the software can use rather than rediscover in the backup files. For this reason, if you have both a VBK and a VBM file, you should choose the VBM file when performing a restore."
