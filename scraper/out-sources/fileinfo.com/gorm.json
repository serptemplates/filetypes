      "A GORM file is a user interface (UI) data file created by Gorm, the graphical interface design tool for the GNUstep development environment. It contains a static representation of interface objects, such as windows, buttons, and menus, and the relationships between them. Developers use GORM files to define their application's interface's visual layout and structure without writing code manually."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "GNUstep developers typically use GORM files in Objective-C applications to separate interface design from logic. This separation allows for easier collaboration, since designers can build the UI in Gorm while programmers write the underlying functionality.",
      "GORM files are similar in function to .NIB or .XIB files used in Apple's Interface Builder for macOS and iOS development. However, GORM files are used specifically within the GNUstep framework, which is an open-source implementation of Apple's Cocoa (formerly NeXTSTEP) APIs. The file format allows developers to load and display interface elements only when needed, which can help optimize application performance."
