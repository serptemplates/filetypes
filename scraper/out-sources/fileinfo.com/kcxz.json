      "A file with the .kcxz extension has been renamed and encrypted by KCXZ ransomware. It contains an image, document, or other file the ransomware is holding hostage. The .kcxz extension is appended to the file's normal extension, producing a compound extension like .jpg.kcxz."

      "Like other forms of ransomware, KCXZ ransomware encrypts a user's files and then produces a plain text ransom note. The note contains instructions users can supposedly follow to purchase a decryption key and restore their files.",
      "Infected files' names gain not only the .kcxz extension, but also the word locked at the beginning of their name. Thus, an infected file named example001.jpg would become locked-example001.jpg.kcxz."
