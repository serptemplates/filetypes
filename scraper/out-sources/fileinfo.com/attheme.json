      "Since ATTHEME files are saved in a plain text format, you can open and edit them with a basic text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (Mac), or a source code editor. However, it's safer and more convenient to create and adjust themes in ATTHEME files with Telegram's built-in theme editor on Android."
