      "An ARI file is a still frame image recorded by an ARRI digital video camera, such as ALEXA MINI and AMIRA. It stores uncompressed image data in the ARRIRAW format exactly how the sensor on the camera captured it. ARI files are single still frames from a sequence of images that comprise a recorded video."

      "ARRI Group is a German camera manufacturer specializing in producing motion picture cameras and lenses. Professional video editors and cinematographers often work with ARRI cameras and .MXF video files.",
      "However, video editors may work with individual ARI still frame files that make up the more extended video sequence to modify its properties more accurately. For example, they may alter the coloring of the still frame or apply special effects."
