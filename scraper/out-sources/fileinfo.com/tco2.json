      "Middle school, high school, and college students use TI-Nspire CX II graphing calculators to plot functions, analyze numerical data, solve complex equations, and perform other mathematical operations. The TI-Nspire CX II uses its own unique OS, which can be updated when the calculator is connected to a computer that has Texas Instruments TI-Nspire Software installed.",
      "To update a TI-Nspire CX II's OS, a student or teacher must first download an update file from Texas Instruments' website (education.ti.com). These update files are saved with the .tco2 extension. From there, the student or teacher must use Texas Instruments TI-Nspire Software to finish performing their OS update, as described in their calculator's guidebook."
