      "A WP2 file is an image saved in the WebP 2 raster image format, the successor to the WebP format. The WebP 2 format supports both lossy and lossless compression and reduces file size roughly 30% more than the WebP standard. WP2 files also support animations and include an alpha channel for transparency."
