      "You can package ASWS files as ASWCS files with the SkinPacker program (ashSkPck.exe) included with Avast installations. However, Avast dropped support for ASWS skin files and ASWCS compressed skin files beginning with Avast 5 and later. Therefore, ASWCS and ASWS files are no longer usable with recent editions of the software."
