      "An M4R file is a custom iPhone ringtone that plays back during an incoming call. It is similar to an .M4A file as it stores audio data encoded with the Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) codec in the MPEG-4 Part 14 (MP4) multimedia container format. Before Apple discontinued iTunes, iPhone users often downloaded M4R files from the media player and then transferred them to an iPhone when the phone was synced with the computer via iTunes."

      "Apple introduced the M4R format in 2007 to store audio played back by an iPhone during an incoming call. While users primarily downloaded and transferred M4R files with iTunes before Apple discontinued it, they could also manually transfer M4R files on their computer to their connected iPhone with a third-party file manager. After transferring an M4R file to their phone, they can set it as the ringtone on their iPhone by selecting Settings → Sounds & Haptics → Ringtone.",
      "Additionally, users could create M4R files with iTunes, but they also may create them with third-party software programs or download them from the Internet. M4R files not created with iTunes most likely do not include copyright protection.",
