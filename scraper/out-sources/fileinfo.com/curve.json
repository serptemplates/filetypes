      "A CURVE file is a drawing created by Linearity Curve, a vector graphic design program. The drawing a CURVE file contains may consist of shapes, pen strokes, brush strokes, and/or text. Typically, these elements are split into several distinct layers, which can be edited independently of each other."

      "Graphic designers use Linearity Curve to design logos, posters, icons, and other vector-based digital artwork. By default, Curve saves the drawings that users create in its proprietary CURVE file format.",
      "Most CURVE files contain several drawing and/or text layers, which appear as separate editable objects in Curve. Storing image elements in separate layers allows users to edit those elements individually, without modifying or disrupting the elements stored in the image's other layers.",
      "NOTE: Curve was formerly known as Vectornator, which saved users' drawings as .VECTORNATOR files. While CURVE files and VECTORNATOR files use different file extensions, they use the same file format."
