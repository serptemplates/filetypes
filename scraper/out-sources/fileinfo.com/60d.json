      "A 60D file is a video file that stores surveillance footage recorded by various closed-circuit television (CCTV) systems, most prominently, GE Security Digital Video Multiplexer Recorders (DVMR). It contains one or more video clips, combining video feeds from multiple cameras in a proprietary format developed by GE Security."

    "content": [
      "GE Security developed the 60D format for organizing surveillance footage in one location. DVMRs primarily used it in the 1990s and early 2000s. However, the format became obscure as newer technologies and file formats emerged, offering improved compatibility, higher-quality video, and more efficient storage. By the late 2000s, the 60D format had largely been replaced, leading to the discontinuation of tools that supported the format, such as WaveReader and SplitWave."
