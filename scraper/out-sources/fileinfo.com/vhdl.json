      "A VHDL file is a source file written in the VHDL language, which stands for Very High Speed Integrated Circuits (VHSIC) Hardware Description Language (HDL). It may be used to specify how a circuit and its components operate and are implemented. It is similar to the .VHD file but less common."

      "VHDL was created in the 1980s to develop a high-speed integrated circuit. It has since become an industry-standard language for describing digital systems at the structural or behavioral levels in a text-based format. The VHDL file can be used to manufacture a physical circuit such as a motherboard, processor, or memory module."
