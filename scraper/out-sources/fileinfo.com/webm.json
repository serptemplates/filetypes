      "A WEBM file is a video saved in the WebM format, an open, royalty-free format designed for sharing video on the web. WebM uses a container structure similar to the Matroska (.MKV) video format, which stores both audio and video data. Video is compressed using a VP8 or VP9 codec, and audio is compressed with either the Vorbis or Opus audio codec."
