      "An AMV file is a video saved in the Actions Media Video file format, which is used by some Chinese portable media players. It contains a compressed, low-resolution (96x96 to 320x240 pixel) video. AMV files can be played using the desktop PC software included with AMV media players, as well as VideoLAN VLC media player."

      "AMV files are a variant of .AVI files that are used by some Chinese media players. Notably, AMV files include the text AMV and amvh in their headers, where AVI files would contain the text AMI and avih. The files' audio is compressed is using the PCM audio codec.",
      "The AMV format was designed to allow cheaply-made media players that use the Actions semiconductor chip to store and play many low-quality videos. AMV videos are not highly compressed, but their initial file size is so low (due to their low resolution and frame rate) that even inexpensive media players can store and play back a number of AMV videos."

If you want to convert an AMV video to a more standard video format, such as AVI or .MP4, you can do so using FFmpeg (cross-platform), AnyMP4 Video Converter (Windows, Mac), or Online Media Technologies AVS Video Converter (Windows)."
