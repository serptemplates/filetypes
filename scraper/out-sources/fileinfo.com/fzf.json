      "Released in the late 1980s and early 1990s, Casio FZ series electronic keyboards allow users to play music using synthesized sounds. The FZ series included the FZ-1, FZ-10M, and FZ-20M keyboards. The Hohner HS-1 is a rebranded FZ-1.",
      "FZ series users who want to modify the sounds their keyboard contains can do using FZDUMP. FZDUMP allows users to extract sounds from or send sounds to FZ series keyboards. When a user chooses to extract all the sounds from their keyboard, FZDUMP saves the resulting collection as an FZF file. In contrast, .FZB files contain a single sound bank, and .FZV files contain a single sound. At most, an FZF file can contain 64 sounds, as that is the maximum number of sounds an FZ series keyboard can store."
