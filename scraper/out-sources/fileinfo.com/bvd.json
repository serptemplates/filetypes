      "A BVD file is an encrypted virtual drive created by Bitdefender, a cybersecurity application focused on antivirus and Internet security. It is a \"vault\" that typically contains sensitive or confidential documents and incorporates encryption and password protection to keep data secure from unauthorized access. Since July 2020, Bitdefender no longer supports the BVD Vault format."
