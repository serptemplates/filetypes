      "An STL file is a 3D model saved in the Stereolithography (STL) file format developed by 3D Systems. It contains plain text or binary data that describes a set of triangular facets, which comprise a model. STL files are quite common, and they can be opened in many CAD and 3D modeling programs."

      "Stereolithography is a form of 3D printing primarily used for creating product prototypes. In the late 1980s, 3D Systems co-founder Chuck Hull patented stereolithography technology, and 3D Systems created the STL file format. Primarily, STL files contain 3D models meant to be printed using stereolithography.",
      "Because the STL format was one of the first formats used to store models for 3D printing, a large number of 3D model viewers and CAD programs support it. STL files may be saved as plain text files, which contain human-readable triangular tessellation data, or as binary files, which contain the same data saved in a binary format. When opened in a text editor, plain text STL files appear as a list of facets and vertexes, complete with coordinates. These files always begin with the string solid ModelName.",
      "NOTE: STL files are also sometimes referred to as Standard Triangle Language files and Standard Tessellation Language files."
