      "A DMS file is a compressed Amiga disk image created using Amiga's Disk Masher System (DMS). It contains data intended for use with an Amiga computer. DMS files were originally used to transfer data among Amiga users via physical floppy disks, but are now most often used to share Amiga games, programs, and other files online, for use with Amiga emulators such as Amiga Forever."

      "The Amiga was created by Commodore International and was one of the earliest PCs to support advanced graphics, sound, and video. Its superior multimedia capabilities made it quite popular among gamers, music enthusiasts, video producers, and other creatives. However, as other companies released computers and game consoles that matched or surpassed the Amiga's capabilities, the Amiga faded from the PC market."

      "Many modern decompression programs do not support the DMS format, so you might have to download a program such as The Unarchiver (Mac) or WinFellow (Windows) if you want to view the files contained within a DMS archive.",
