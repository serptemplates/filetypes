      "The Source Engine is a 3D game engine that Valve uses to develop video games, such as Half Life 2, Left 4 Dead, and Portal 2. Games developed using the Source Engine use textures saved in the Valve Texture Format. These textures are usually created by converting a .TGA file to the VTF format, using Source's Vtex tool.",
