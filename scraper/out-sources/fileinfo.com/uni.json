      "A UNI file is an audio module created by Ultra Tracker, a discontinued music tracker from the 1990s. It contains note patterns, instrument data, and playback instructions that the tracker references to recreate music using pre-recorded samples. Ultra Tracker introduced the UNI format to replace .ULT files as its native module format (the UNI format provides more composing customization to users)."

    "content": [
      "Otto Chrons developed Ultra Tracker in the mid-1990s to compose and play module-based music. However, Ultra Tracker fell into obscurity, and the UNI format never achieved the same usage as more established formats, such as .MOD, .S3M, and .XM.",
      "Despite Ultra Tracker's obscurity, MikMod, a popular tracker during the 90s, added support for UNI files, allowing users to play UNI files alongside other tracker modules. This compatibility ensured users could still play Ultra Tracker compositions even after the software became less common."
