      "A PCL file is a digital printed document created in the Printer Command Language (PCL) page description language. It describes the layout of text and graphics for the document. The PCL format was originally used by Hewlett-Packard printers in the 1980s and is now used by HP LaserJet printers and others. PCL is widely-used but offers fewer features than the PostScript (.PS) format."
