      "An SFAP0 file is a temporary audio file automatically created and deleted by MAGIX Sound Forge Pro and VEGAS Pro applications. The software creates the SFAP0 file when a user is working on an .FRG or .VEG project and references the data it contains as an intermediate file to help stream audio data to the application more smoothly."
