      "A PPSM file is a macro-enabled slide show created by Microsoft PowerPoint, a program that allows users to create slide shows and presentations. It contains one or more macro-enabled slides, which may include text, images, and transitions. PPSM files are primarily used to store presentations with embedded macros that are meant to be displayed, not edited."

    "content": [
      "PPSM files are similar to .PPSX files, but they contain macros that are executed by PowerPoint. Even if a PPSX file contains embedded macros, PowerPoint will not execute them until they are first saved as a PPSM file.",
      "Macros in PowerPoint function similarly to scripts allowing you to automate repetitive tasks such as formatting a slide or creating new slide themes. You can create and edit macros using Visual Basic for Applications (VBA) through the View tab in the ribbon.",
      "Like PPSX files, PPSM files are primarily created for the purpose of sharing presentations that are only meant to be displayed. While PowerPoint can edit PPSX files if you want to share an Open XML-based .PPTX presentations with macros that can be edited, save it as a .PPTM file.",
      "NOTE: PPSM files were introduced with the release of Microsoft Office 2007."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open, edit, save, and convert PPSM files with Microsoft PowerPoint in Windows and macOS. PowerPoint is the best application for opening PPSM files because the software fully supports the macros embedded in the slides and the formatting of the slides, which includes the placement of text and images.",
      "Several other presentation programs can open PPSM files but they may not fully support the formatting of the slides or macros embedded in the slides. Alternative programs include Kingsoft Presentation (multiplatform) and Apple Keynote (Mac). If you are a Mac user simply looking to view a PPSM file, you can use Apple Preview, which comes bundled with macOS.",
      "You can also upload PPSM files to Google Drive to view them, or upload them to Google Slides to view, edit, and convert them (does not support macros). Google Drive is a cloud storage service and Google Slides is a web application for editing presentations. Both are free and accessible with a Google account."
