      "A PSDB file is an image created using Effectmatrix PixelStyle, a photo editor and vector graphic creation tool. It contains one or more image, text, drawing, and/or adjustment layers that, when viewed together, comprise a finalized image. You can use PixelStyle to export the image a PSDB file contains as a .JPG, .PNG, .JP2, .TIFF, .PDF, .BMP, .GIF, or .SVG file."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "PixelStyle's PSDB files are similar to Adobe Photoshop's .PSD files. Like PSD files, PSDB files contain image elements separated into many layers. This allows photographers, graphic designers, and other users to adjust each image element separately, without affecting other parts of their image.",
      "If you want to view the image a PSDB file contains outside PixelStyle, you must export the image in a different file format. To export an image from PixelStyle, select File → Export ... from the program's menu bar."
