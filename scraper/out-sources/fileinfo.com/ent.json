      "An ENT file is a plain text file that contains external entity definitions used in markup languages, such as .XML and .SGML. These entities serve as placeholders or references for content, such as special characters, text snippets, or symbols, that may appear multiple times in a document. ENT files are commonly used alongside a Document Type Definition (.DTD) file, which specifies the structure and rules for the markup."

    "content": [
      "XML and SGML documents reference ENT files to reuse standard entity definitions without repeating them in every file. For example, an ENT file might define commonly used characters, file paths, or shared components in a documentation system. By storing this data externally, ENT files help make markup documents cleaner and easier to maintain.",
      "Developers, technical writers, and content managers who work with structured documents are the primary users of ENT files. These users often rely on ENT files to manage large sets of content efficiently and consistently."
