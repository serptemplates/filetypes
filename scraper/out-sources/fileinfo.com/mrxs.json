      "An MRXS file is an image file created by MIRAX-compatible microscope digital slide scanners, such as the Carl Zeiss MIRAX series or the 3DHISTECH Pannoramic series. It stores images of multiple specimen samples from glass slides on a single digitized virtual slide. MRXS files are used to archive and analyze microscope images."
