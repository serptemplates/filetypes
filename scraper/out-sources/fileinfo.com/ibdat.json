      "An IBDAT file is a data file created by Smart Projects IsoBuster, a program used to recover data from damaged disks and file systems. It contains data blocks of a larger drive that are referenced by location paths stored in an .IBADR file. IBDAT files are created with IBADR files by IsoBuster to debug issues encountered by the program."
