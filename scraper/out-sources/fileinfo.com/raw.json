      "A RAW file is a photo created by a digital camera, such as a Panasonic, Leica, or Casio camera. It contains raw image data captured by a digital camera's CCD. Professional photographers often work with RAW files, since they can more accurately edit images stored in the RAW format."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "Because the images that RAW files contain are either uncompressed or losslessly-compressed, they are higher quality than lossy-compressed images, like .JPG and .PNG files. However, because RAW files retain all this image data, their file sizes are often quite large. This is the tradeoff between lower-quality, smaller images and higher-quality, larger images.",
      "RAW files are one of many raw camera image formats. Some other common formats are Digital Negative Images (.DNG files), Canon Raw Images (.CR2 files), Sony Digital Camera Images (.ARW files), Kodak RAW Images (.DCR files), Nikon RAW Images (.NRW files), and Nikon Electronic Format Images (.NEF files).",
      "NOTE: RAW files may also be created by image generation software instead of digital cameras, although this is not as common."
