      "Autodesk Inventor is a computer-aided design (CAD) application that engineers and product designers use to prototype mechanical products. Those prototypes, referred to as assemblies, are saved in IAM files.",
      "After finalizing an assembly, users can test how their prototype would perform in the real world using Inventor's motion simulation and stress analysis tools. They can also share their IAM file with others using Inventor's cloud-based sharing tools and Autodesk Viewer.",
      "NOTE: Inventor users who also use Autodesk AutoCAD can transform a 2D .DWG drawing into a 3D IAM file by importing the drawing into Inventor."

      "You can open an IAM file in Autodesk Inventor (Windows), Autodesk Fusion 360 (cross-platform), and Autodesk Viewer (Web). If you only need to see the 3D model an IAM file contains, the easiest way to do so is by opening it in Autodesk Viewer."
