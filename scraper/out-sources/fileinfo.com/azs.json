      "When you receive an AZS file you're given specific permissions for that file, it may be to view, copy, or print. With the AZS file open, FileSECURE Reader disables any Windows print screen functions and utilities.",
      "To see your access permissions are for a specific AZS file, click File → Properties in the Reader menu. You can also choose the \"Properties\" option on the taskbar. The Permission window contains information about your permissions and other contents of the file.",
      "If you have the Copy permission and the original program that created the file, the file will be opened in the original program.",
      "NOTE: AZS files are the same as .AZF files."
