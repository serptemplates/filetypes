      "Because WIOT files are encrypted, you cannot open them. Additionally, because WIOT files are encrypted using an online private key, there is no way to decrypt them.",
      "If your computer has been infected by WIOT ransomware, the best option to restore your files to their original state is likely to perform a System Restore. Note that performing a System Restore will cause you to lose any data created in the interval between now and your last restore point. So, you may want to back up any data and files created since your last restore point."
