      "A JBEAM file contains information in the JBeam format that defines soft-body vehicles appearing in games employing the BeamNG engine. It stores plain text information, such as nodes and beams, representing the appearance and behavior of a vehicle or a vehicle part (e.g., a hood, fender, wheel, etc.). JBeam is based on the JSON format, which you can create, open, and edit with source code or text editors."

      "The BeamNG engine specializes in simulating the physics of car crashes. The driving simulation game BeamNG.Drive prominently uses JBEAM files for its vehicles.",
      "Most BeamNG.Drive gamers will likely only encounter JBEAM files if they attempt to alter vehicles' appearance and capabilities in the game. For example, a gamer may modify the properties in a JBEAM file and place it back in the appropriate vehicle folder for the game to display the changes to the vehicle.",

      "JBEAM files are not meant to be opened. Instead, games using the BeamNG engine reference JBEAM files for vehicle behavior in the game.",
      "However, since the files are saved in a text-based format, you can open and edit them with source code or plain text editors. Source code editors, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code, are better options than simple text editors since they provide syntax highlighting capabilities."
