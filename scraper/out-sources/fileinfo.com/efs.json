    "description": [
      "An EFS file is an audio file used by Ensoniq SQ-80, a digital-analog hybrid synthesizer synthesizer released in 1987. It stores information about audio patches and sound settings that users share with other SQ-80 users to transfer and load them to experiment with different sounds."

    "content": [
      "The SQ-80 became popular among musicians and sound designers in the 1980s. Since the EFS format is uncommon outside of the Ensoniq SQ-80 ecosystem, it became obscure once Ensoniq discontinued the SQ-80 synthesizer. However, retro audio enthusiasts may still use the file type."
