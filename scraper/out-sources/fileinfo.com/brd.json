      "A BRD file is a CAD file created by Autodesk EAGLE, an application used for schematic capture and PCB (printed circuit board) design. It is created with the EAGLE Layout Editor and used to develop design templates for circuitry. BRD files can be saved in the Gerber drill data format, which may be used by CAM (computer-aided manufacturing) programs."

      "Autodesk EAGLE is an electronic design automation program that allows engineers to create circuit diagrams. The program was formerly known as CadSoft Eagle, before Autodesk acquired it in 2016.",
      "EAGLE's PCB layout editor allows engineers to place circuit diagrams upon a virtual copy of a real-life circuit board. These circuit board layouts are saved as BRD files. In addition to being able to open and edit BRD files in EAGLE and other PCB design applications, engineers can send their PCB files to PCB fabricators, who use the files to assemble physical circuit boards.",
      "NOTE: Prior to version 6, EAGLE BRD files were saved in a proprietary text and binary format. Version 6 and later BRD files are saved in the XML format."

      "If you do not have access to any of the above applications, the easiest way to view the circuit board design contained within a BRD file is to upload it to Altium 365 Viewer, a free, online CAD file viewer (Web)."
