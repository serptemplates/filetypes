      "A CMS file contains a profile used by Windows Connection Manager, a software package that allows system administrators to set up remote connections for users. It stores configuration information about a user's operating system and permissions that enable a connection between a remote user and a network. CMS files are generated by the Connection Manager Administrator Kit (CMAK) program."

    "content": [
      "You most likely will only encounter CMS profile files if you are a network administrator that sets up a Connection Manager for the purpose of remotely connecting to a network, such as an organizational network protected by a VPN server or an Internet Service Provider (ISP). For example, a network administrator at a company may set up an employee with Connection Manager to allow him to access the company network from a remote location.",
      "The network administrator creates a profile with the CMAK application and packages it with other configuration files, such as .CMP and .INF files in an .EXE file. The administrator then distributes the package to a remote user, which allows him to connect to the network."
