      "A HOOP file is a file that has been renamed and encrypted by HOOP ransomware, which is malware distributed by cybercriminals. It contains a normal file, such as a document or image, that the ransomware is holding hostage. HOOP files cannot be decrypted."

      "In August 2021, some PC users began reporting that their computers had been infected a new variant of STOP ransomware. This variant encrypts users' files and appends them with the .hoop extension. The ransomware then produces a plain text ransom note named _readme.txt. The note contains instructions users are meant to follow to decrypt their files.",
      "HOOP ransomware is most commonly distributed within \"free programs\" that are actually adware and malware bundles. If you recently downloaded and installed a \"free program\" (especially one that is meant to be a copy of a paid program) from a software download website, that may be how your computer became infected by HOOP ransomware.",
      "NOTE: To learn more about STOP ransomware and its variants, refer to the .STOP entry."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "Because HOOP files are encrypted, you cannot open them. Additionally, because HOOP files are encrypted using an online private key, there is no way to decrypt them.",
      "If your computer has been infected by HOOP ransomware, the best option to restore your files to their original state is likely to perform a System Restore. Note that performing a System Restore will cause you to lose any data created in the interval between now and your last restore point. So, you may want to back up any data and files created since your last restore point."
