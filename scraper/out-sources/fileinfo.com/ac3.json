    "description": [
      "An AC3 file is an audio file saved in the AC-3 (Dolby Digital) audio format. It can include up to six channels of audio (DD 5.1 surround sound with subwoofer output). Cinema movies, DVDs, Blu-rays, and video games often use audio saved as AC3 files."

    "content": [
      "Dolby created the Dolby Digital format for use in cinemas and home theaters with surround sound capabilities. Each of an AC3 file's primary audio channels is meant to be played on a different surround sound speaker (left, center, right, left surround, right surround). The sixth channel, known as the low-frequency effects (LFE) channel, contains intense low-frequency sounds meant to be played on a subwoofer.",
      "However, televisions, PCs, and other devices can also play the audio an AC3 file contains. To do so, these devices downmix the AC3 file's audio, playing multiple channels worth of audio out the same output device. For example, a computer with only left and right speakers will play an AC3 file's center channel out both speakers, to approximate surround sound playback as best it can."
