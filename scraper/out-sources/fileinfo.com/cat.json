      "Windows catalog files help to suppress multiple trust dialog popups for new software component downloads. Since CAT files can identify a trusted source, the user can choose to \"Always trust content\" from the software distributor. Then, future downloads from the software distributor that use a CAT file are trusted and do not require a trust popup window."
