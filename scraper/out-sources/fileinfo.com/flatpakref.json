      "You can install an app packaged in a FLATPAKREF file by double-clicking the file, which opens the Software Center, then gives you the option to install the app. You can also right-click the FLATPAKREF file and select Open With Software Install. Both of these methods require Gnome software and Flatpak to be installed on your system.",

      "flatpak install --from [app_name].flatpakref",
      "Since FLATPAKREF files store information in plain text you can also open them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (macOS). Keep in mind that opening a FLATPAKREF file with a text editor will not install the app, and incorrectly modifying it will cause it to become corrupt."
