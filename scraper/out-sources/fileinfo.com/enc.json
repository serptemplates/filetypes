      "An ENC file is a generic data file that stores encoded information, saved in one of many proprietary or standard formats. Typically, ENC files are encoded to prevent users from modifying the data they contain or using them in an unauthorized manner. However, some ENC files are encoded to optimize them for a particular use, such as transfer over the internet."

      "In some cases, ENC files may be encoded using a standard encoding format. For example, some ENC files are encoded using standard uuencode (.UUE) encoding. You can decode standardly-encoded ENC files with any program that supports the format in which they are encoded.",
      "However, most ENC files are encoded using proprietary encoding formats. Only the program that created and/or uses these ENC files can decode them and read the data they contain."
