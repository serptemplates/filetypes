      "A JP2 file is a compressed bitmap image saved in the JPEG 2000 (JP2) Core Coding format. It supports any color bit depth and image metadata and may be compressed with lossy or lossless compression. Users often save digital photos and medical images, such as CT and MRI scans, as JP2 files."

      "The JPEG 2000 standard was developed in the late-1990s by a Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) committee to replace the JPEG standard released in 1992. It provides several improvements over the JPEG format. However, the main improvement is incorporating a wavelet compression algorithm instead of the Digital Cosine Transform (DCT) compression used by standard JPEG images.",
      "There are many applications for the JPEG 2000 compression standard apart from digital photos and medical images. Some examples include digital cinema, broadcast media, and surveillance video.",
      "NOTE: JP2 files may also be saved as .JPF, .JPC, or .JPX files."
