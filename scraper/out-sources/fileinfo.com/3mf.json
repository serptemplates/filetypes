    "description": [
      "A 3MF file is a 3D model saved in the 3D Manufacturing Format (3MF), which is supported by various 3D design and printing applications. It is a Zip-compressed archive that contains a 3D model’s geometry, material information, and other properties. 3MF files may also include a print ticket (with recommended print settings), a .JPG or .PNG thumbnail, digital signatures, and other metadata (e.g., author, license, or production notes)."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "The 3MF Consortium developed the format to simplify and modernize the 3D printing process, with the first version released in 2015. 3MF is intended to be an all-in-one solution that replaces older formats like .STL, .OBJ, and .AMF, helping to reduce compatibility issues and improve design-to-fabrication workflows.",
      "For example, while the STL format is widely supported, it only stores geometry (just the outer shell), with no color, materials, scale, or metadata. 3MF supports all of this information, combining it all into a single, standardized ZIP-based file.",
      "NOTE: Microsoft founded the 3MF consortium, which includes members such as Autodesk, HP, GE Global Research, Fit AG, Shapeways, SLM Solutions Group, Ultimaker, Stratasys, Siemens PLM Software, and Dassault Systèmes."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open 3MF files with various apps, including the free Microsoft 3D Builder app in Windows and the cross-platform Ultimaker Cura and PrusaSlicer apps. For example, to open a 3MF file with 3D Builder, click the hamburger menu icon and then select Open.",
      "Since 3MF files are Zip-compressed, you can extract their contents with a Zip utility, such as Windows File Explorer, Corel WinZip, or Apple Archive Utility. You may need to rename the .3mf file extension to .zip for the utility to recognize the format and extract the contents of the archive."
