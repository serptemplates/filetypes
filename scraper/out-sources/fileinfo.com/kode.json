      "To encrypt a file in KodeFile, select Encrypt on the home screen, add your file(s) or folder(s), and click Encrypt. KodeFile allows you to encrypt multiple files at the same time but each file is encrypted individually as separate KODE files. When KodeFile encrypts a file, the .kode extension is appended to the file. For example, the sample.pdf file becomes sample.pdf.kode.",
