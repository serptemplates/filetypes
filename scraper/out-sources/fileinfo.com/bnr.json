    "instructions": [
      "BNR files are not meant to be opened. On a real Wii or GameCube, the console automatically reads the BNR file and displays the banner image and sound when you highlight the game or channel in the system menu. Emulators, such as Dolphin, also automatically load the files.",
      "However, game modders looking to modify BNR files may use specialized tools created by the modding and homebrew community. Because BNR files contain both graphics and optional sound data, modders cannot open them with a standard text editor or image viewer."
