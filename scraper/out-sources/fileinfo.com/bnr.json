      "A BNR file is a banner file used by the Nintendo Wii and GameCube to display information about a game or channel. It stores data for the banner image, as well as optional animations and sound effects that play when the game or channel is highlighted in the system menu. This functionality allows users to visually identify a title before launching it."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "On the Wii, BNR files are typically stored inside content.bin files, which hold data for downloaded channels or save information. The Wii operating system reads the BNR file automatically when displaying the channel screen, so users do not open these files manually. On the GameCube, a BNR file was stored on the game disc and contained the banner image and title information shown in the console's memory card management screen.",
      "A BNR file typically includes a banner image (often 96 × 32 pixels) in a format supported by the console, as well as metadata, such as the game title and publisher name. It may also include a short sound clip that plays when the banner is selected. Some members of the Wii homebrew and modding community edit BNR files to create custom banners for channels or games, allowing them to personalize the way titles appear in the Wii menu or in Wii emulators."

      "BNR files are not meant to be opened. On a real Wii or GameCube, the console automatically reads the BNR file and displays the banner image and sound when you highlight the game or channel in the system menu. Emulators, such as Dolphin, also automatically load the files.",
      "However, game modders looking to modify BNR files may use specialized tools created by the modding and homebrew community. Because BNR files contain both graphics and optional sound data, modders cannot open them with a standard text editor or image viewer."
