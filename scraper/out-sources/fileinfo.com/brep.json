      "A BREP file is a 3D model file saved in the Boundary Representation (BRep) CAD format. It contains three-dimensional data, which may include vertices, edges, wires, faces, shells, solids, compounds, edge triangulations, face triangulations, polylines on triangulations, space location and orientation."

    "content": [
      "The BRep format primarily consists of two main parts: 1) Topological components, such as faces, vertices, and edges, and 2)the connections between the components, such as surfaces, points, and curves. The format is often used by CAD applications to save 3D models of real-life objects or buildings for the purpose of being manufactured and constructed.",
      "Various CAD file types utilize the BRep format, such as CATIA .CATPART and .CATPRODUCT, .IGS and .IGES, .STEP, and Parasolid .X_B and .X_T. While the BRep format is common in the CAD community, actual BREP files are uncommon."
