    "instructions": [
      "You can extract files contained in a 7Z archive with various decompression utilities, such as 7-Zip (Windows), Corel WinZip (Windows), Apple Archive Utility (bundled with Macs), Corel WinZip Mac (Mac), and B1 Free Archiver (multiplatform).",
      "If your 7Z archive is split into a multi-volume archive (e.g., you possess a .7Z.001 file, a .7Z.002 file, and so on), you can extract all the files included within the multi-volume archive by opening the archive's 7Z.001 file in a decompression utility. For this to work, all the multi-volume archive's files must be stored in the same folder. Also, you must possess every file included in the archive. For example, if you have a .7Z.003 file and .7Z.005 file, but not a .7Z.004 file, you may have trouble extracting your files. (Some utilities that can decompress single-volume 7Z archives cannot decompress multi-volume archives. For example, Apple Archive Utility cannot decompress multi-volume 7Z archives.)",
      "NOTE: Some 7Z archives may be password-protected. To open these archives, you must enter the password used to create the archive when prompted."
