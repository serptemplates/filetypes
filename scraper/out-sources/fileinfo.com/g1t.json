      "A G1T file is a texture archive used in a video game developed by Gust, a division of Koei Tecmo Games. It contains 2D images used to skin a game's 3D models. Modders have developed utilities that allow them to extract the textures a G1T file contains."

      "Gust has developed many popular role-playing game series, including the Atelier series, Surge Concerto series, and Nights of Azure series. These series use game assets saved in various proprietary file formats, including the G1T format.",
