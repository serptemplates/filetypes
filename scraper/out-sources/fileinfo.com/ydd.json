      "A YDD file is a 3D model used in Grand Theft Auto V, an open-world action-adventure game published by Rockstar Games. It contains a character feature, such as a head, facial feature, hair, or article of clothing. YDD files are similar to .YDR files, which contain Grand Theft Auto V 3D objects."

    "content": [
      "Modders use the OpenIV modding utility to extract YDD files from Grand Theft Auto V. Like YDR files, YDD files are compressed with Zlib compression. They can be decompressed to access the de-textured 3D model (.odd file) and textures stored in them."

    "instructions": [
      "After extracting a YDD file from Grand Theft Auto V, GTA V modders can open the file in AutoDesk 3DS Max using the player-created GIMS Evo plug-in. They can then modify the file as they see fit before exporting it and loading it into GTA V using OpenIV. For more complete instructions, refer to this YouTube video."
