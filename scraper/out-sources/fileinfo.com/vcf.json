      "You can open VCF files with various applications. Windows users can open vCards with Windows Contacts and Microsoft People (bundled with Windows) and Microsoft Outlook (an email client included with Microsoft Office). Mac users can open vCards with the Contacts application included with macOS or the third-party Flexibits Cardhop app. Android and iOS users can also load vCards directly into the Contacts apps bundled with their respective operating systems.",
      "Since vCards are saved in a text format, you can also open them with a plain text editor. However, the files may also include a block of binary data, which is often used to store a photo. Also, the information in the file will not be displayed the same as if it was opened in a contacts program."
