      "An XLT file is a template created by Microsoft Excel, a spreadsheet application included in the Microsoft Office suite. It contains default formatting and data for a spreadsheet and is used to create new .XLS files. XLT files are saved in the Excel Binary File Format, which was Excel's primary file format until the Office Open XML format (.XLTX) replaced it in Excel 2007."

      "Microsoft Excel includes a number of pre-created XLT files that allow you to quickly create common documents, such as budget planners, calendars, and invoices, from predefined templates. You can also create custom templates from your own spreadsheets, allowing you to quickly create similar spreadsheets in the future.",
      "Excel is the most widely-used spreadsheet application in the world. It comes with every edition of the Microsoft Office suite and is used in home, academic, and business environments.",
