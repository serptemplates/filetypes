      "TEXT files store text that can be viewed and edited in Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, and other text editors. Unlike .RTF, .DOCX, and .PAGES files, TEXT files cannot include advanced formatting, such as bolding, italicization, font styles, and text alignment.",
      "Because TEXT files cannot include formatting, they typically contain only basic information, such as notes, step-by-step instructions, and program information logs. Software developers may also package TEXT files with games and tools they distribute to contain instructions or other information about the software.",
      "Users who need to create more complicated text documents, such as resumes, reports, letters, or flyers, typically do not save those documents as TEXT files. Instead, they use Microsoft Word or Apple Pages to create and save documents as DOCX or PAGES files."
