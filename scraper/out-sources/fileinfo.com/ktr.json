      "A KTR file is a source code file used by programs written in the Keter programming language. KTR files and the Keter programming language use aspects of the Minimalist & Extensive Markup Language (MEML), which is also used by .MEML files."

However, source code editors provide helpful code-editing features that basic text editors do not. So, you are better off opening a KTR file in a source code editor if possible."
