      "An EPS file is a vector graphic saved in the Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) format. It contains PostScript-formatted image data, ideal for scaling high-resolution images, and may include bitmap image data and text. EPS files also store a low-resolution embedded bitmap image for previewing the graphic."

      "Adobe developed the EPS format in the late 1980s to become a standard for exchanging images across different platforms and devices. While various applications and users adopted the format, other image formats overshadowed it, such as .JPEG and .PNG.",
      "Although EPS never became as widely used as Adobe intended, graphics professionals commonly save their artwork in the format, such as icons and drawings. For example, graphic designers often use professional vector image editors, such as Adobe Illustrator or Serif Affinity Designer, to save artwork as EPS files for large print jobs (e.g., posters, banners, and billboard advertisements) because of the format's scalability."
