      "A FIG file contains a figure created by The MathWorks MATLAB, an application for mathematical computations and data analysis. It stores one or more plots or graphs, which MATLAB uses to visualize data. FIG files store information in a format similar to the MAT-file (.MAT) binary data container format."

      "MATLAB is an advanced application that provides various tools to analyze data, develop algorithms, create models, build apps, and more. In MATLAB, a figure is data visualized as a plot, such as a histogram or pie graph, output from mathematical data. Additionally, the figure function creates a figure (window), which allows you to insert plots and graphs.",
