      "A TK file is a script written in Tool Command Language (Tcl), designed to be executed using Wish, an interpreter for Tcl/Tk applications. It defines graphical user interfaces (GUIs) and manages user interactions within Tcl-based programs. TK files are similar to .TCL files but are specifically tailored for applications that use the Tk toolkit for GUI development."

      "Tcl/Tk is a programming language and graphical user interface (GUI) toolkit for scripting and application development that was popular in the 1990s and early 2000s. Software developers, system administrators, and researchers needing to create GUIs for Tcl-based applications used TK files to build applications with buttons, menus, and other user interface elements. Since Wish interprets these scripts, users can run TK files without compiling them.",
      "During the 1990s and early 2000s, many Unix-based systems, academic institutions, and open-source projects relied on Tk for building interactive tools. While Tcl/Tk is less common today, some legacy systems still use the programming language and toolkit."
