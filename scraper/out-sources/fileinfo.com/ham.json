      "A HAM file is a game data file used by Interplay Productions Descent 2, a popular first-person shooter game in which players pilot a spaceship through underground mines. It contains data that controls, among other things, how the game's enemies, weapons, and other objects function. Most HAM files control behavior on a mission-specific basis. Descent2.ham controls behavior on a game-wide basis."
