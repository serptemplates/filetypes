      "An XSLT file is a stylesheet used to transform the content of an .XML document. The styling information it contains is written in the XSLT (Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations) format, which is an extension of XML. Most often, web developers use XSLT files to transform XML content into .HTML content, for use in webpages."

      "In 1998, the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) published the first version of the XSLT markup language. Using XSLT, developers can create stylesheets used to format associated XML datasets and convert them to other file formats (including HTML, plain text, and .PDF). Typically, XSLT stylesheets are saved as XSLT files. (Some may instead be saved as .XSL files.)",
      "In addition to transforming an XML file's content to another format, XSLT files can be used to add, remove, rearrange, or sort elements within an XML file. To use an XSLT file to transform a corresponding XML file, developers feed both files into an XSLT processor. The processor then creates a resulting, transformed file."

However, if you intend to edit an XSLT file's contents, you should open the file in a dedicated XML editor. XML editors provide helpful syntax-highlighting, editing, and validation tools that make working with XSLT files easier.",
