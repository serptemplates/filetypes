      "You can open STORYTEMPLATE files with Articulate Storyline 360 by selecting File → Open. While Articulate 360 is available as an online tool, only the Windows version of the software (available within the Articulate 360 suite) supports STORYTEMPLATE files.",
      "Like STORY files, STORYTEMPLATE files are Zip-compressed, which means you can open them with a compression utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer (bundled with Windows), Apple Archive Utility (bundled with macOS), and Corel WinZip (Windows). However, you may need to change the .storytemplate file extension to .zip for the utility to recognize it. Also, opening the file as a .ZIP archive will not appear the same as opening it with Articulate Storyline 360."
