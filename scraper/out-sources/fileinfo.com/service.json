      "You can open and view SERVICE files with any text editor since they are plain text, but you should only edit them when necessary. Most users manage services using systemd commands such as systemctl start, systemctl stop, and systemctl status rather than modifying the files directly.",
      "If you need to change a service's behavior, do not edit the original file in /​lib/​systemd/​system/​. Instead, copy the file to /​etc/​systemd/​system/​, make your changes there, and run systemctl daemon-reload to apply them. This process preserves your customizations during system updates and package upgrades."
