      "A DMN file contains information in the Decision Model and Notation (DMN) standard developed by the Object Management Group (OMG). It stores business rules and decision logic in a structured XML format that defines a decision model. Businesses use the DMN standard (and DMN files) to describe how to make decisions based on defined inputs, rules, and expected outcomes in a consistent and repeatable way."

    "content": [
      "Business analysts, developers, and process modelers use DMN files in systems that require clear and automated decision-making, such as loan approvals, insurance claims, or regulatory compliance. They typically create and manage these files in business process management (BPM) platforms, such as Camunda, Red Hat Decision Manager, or Drools. A DMN file often includes decision tables, input definitions, and logic expressions that the platform uses to evaluate conditions and produce outcomes."

      "Since DMN files store information in the XML standard, you can also open DMN files with any text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, or Microsoft Visual Studio Code."
