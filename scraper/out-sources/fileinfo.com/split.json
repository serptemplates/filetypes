      "To create a SPLIT file, drag and drop your file into the application. You can also select File → Open..., navigate to your file, and click Open. After you open your file, select \"Split,\" and choose the format of the file (if you are splitting a .PNG file, choose \"PNG\") without any compression. Specify the chunk size you want the file split in to (KB, MB, or GB) and click \"Finish.\"",
