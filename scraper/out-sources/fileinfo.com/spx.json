      "An SPX file is an audio file saved in the Ogg Vorbis container format and encoded with the Speex Audio codec. It supports voice compression at 2 to 44 kbps and supports 8 kHz, 16 kHz, and 32 kHz compression in the same bitstream. SPX files typically store voice recordings for video games and podcasts, but may also store other audio content, such as music or sound effects."
