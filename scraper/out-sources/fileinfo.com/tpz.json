      "A TPZ file is a Zip-compressed archive used by Godot Engine, a free and open source game engine. It is used to distribute export templates that, once installed in Godot Engine, allow developers to export their project as a package that can be run on other platforms without Godot Engine installed."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "When Godot Engine was originally released, it did not come with any export features so developers would have to manually build and compile the appropriate binaries for their target platforms. As a fix to the solution, developers using Godot Engine must download the export templates before they can export their projects to the appropriate package format for the Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and HTML5 platforms.",
      "The export templates are optimized versions of the game engine without the pre-compiled editing tools for each platform. They consist of folders and files in a TPZ archive that is simply a renamed .ZIP file.",
      "The TPZ file can be downloaded in a web browser by clicking the \"EXPORT TEMPLATES\" link from the \"Download\" page on the Godot website. To install the TPZ file in Godot Engine, select Settings → Install Export Templates, then select the TPZ file. The archive can also be downloaded directly to Godot Engine by selecting Editor → Manage Export Templates, then clicking Download.",
      "Since TPZ files are renamed ZIP files, you can extract and view the contents in the file by renaming the .tpz extension to .zip. Then, extract the contents using a ZIP decompression program, such as Microsoft File Explorer, Apple Archive Utility, or Corel WinZip."
