      "An OTP file is a presentation template created by Impress, a presentation program included with Apache OpenOffice (formerly known as OpenOffice.org). It contains a presentation, which includes a master slide as well as a content slide with text, images, shapes, multimedia content, transition effects, and other slide elements. Impress users create OTP files to duplicate .ODP presentations with similar appearance and content."

      "OpenOffice Impress is a free alternative to Microsoft PowerPoint. Impress's OTP files are similar to PowerPoint's .POT and .POTX templates.",

      "You will likely encounter an OTP file only if you use Impress or another OpenOffice user shares a presentation template with you. For example, a co-worker who uses Impress might share an OTP file that contains a branded presentation template with you.",
