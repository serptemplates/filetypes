      "A PDF-1 file is a .PDF file that has been renamed from .pdf to .pdf-1. It is saved in the PDF format, which is commonly used for storing documents and publications in a standard format that can be viewed on multiple platforms. PDF-1 files are typically renamed to indicate that they are the first or second PDF in a series of PDF files."
