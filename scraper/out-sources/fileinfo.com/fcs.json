      "The FSC standard is developed and maintained by the International Society for Advancement of Cytometry (ISAC). It was developed in 1984 and became a standard format supported by a large amount of flow cytometry software and hardware.",
      "Flow cytometry is a biophysical technology for analyzing the chemical and physical characteristics of particles as they pass through a laser. It is used for cell sorting, biomarker detection, protein engineering, and cell counting and applied in basic research, clinical trials, and clinical practice. Most commonly, flow cytometry is used for diagnosing health disorders, such as blood cancers."
