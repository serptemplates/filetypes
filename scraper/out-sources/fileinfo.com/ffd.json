      "FATE is a single-player dungeon crawler in which players fight monsters, complete quests, and collect items in procedurally-generated dungeons. WildTangent released FATE in 2005.",
      "When a FATE player saves their game, the game creates a corresponding FFD file. FFD files are numbered in the order they were created. For example, a player's first saved game will be named 0.ffd, the second 1.ffd, and so on. FATE typically stores FFD files in the game's SAVE directory."

      "You can also use various FFD editing tools, such as FATE Save Editor, to modify the save data an FFD file contains. For example, FATE Save Editor allows you to edit your character's stats, skills, items, and spells."
