Any XYZV files that are referenced by an SSC file must be saved to a \\​data\\​ directory within the directory that the SSC file resides. For example, if cassini.ssc is stored in the \\​extras-standard\\​cassini\\​ directory, then all cassini XYZV files should be stored in the \\​extras-standard\\​cassini\\​data\\​ directory."
