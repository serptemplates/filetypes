    "description": [
      "An LWO file is a three-dimensional object saved in the proprietary LightWave 3D Object (LWO) binary format. It contains points, polygons, and surfaces that describe the object's shape and appearance and may also contain references to image files used for object textures. Users often open LWO files with LightWave 3D to place them in scenes (.LWS files), but they may also open them with other apps, such as Foundry Modo and Bondware Poser."

    "content": [
      "There are several variations of the LWO format, with the first version released in 1994. NewTek released the second version (LWO2) in 2001 (LightWave 6.0).",
      "Typically, LightWave 3D users create LWO files to save 3D objects (Save → Save Current Object). However, users may also export objects as LWO files with other apps, such as Modo and Poser.",
      "NOTE: NewTek initially developed LightWave 3D, but LightWave Digital acquired and currently develops the software."
