      "An XLV file is a module written in Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), a programming language used by Microsoft Excel to automate tasks and extend spreadsheet functionality. It contains VBA code that performs actions, such as manipulating data, generating reports, or customizing how Excel behaves. XLV modules allow users to add features and automate repetitive processes that typically require manual input."

    "content": [
      "Excel uses XLV files as part of its macro and scripting system. Developers and advanced users can create and edit XLV modules within Excel's Visual Basic Editor (VBE), where they can write, test, and organize code. Once created, a user can import or export an XLV file into or from Excel workbooks, allowing the same VBA logic to be reused across multiple projects.",
      "NOTE: Because XLV files can contain executable code, Excel includes security settings that may block or warn users before running them."

      "You can open XLV files with older versions of Microsoft Excel, but current versions of Excel do not support XLV files. To use an XLV file in older versions of Excel, users must enable macros and load the module through the VBE."
