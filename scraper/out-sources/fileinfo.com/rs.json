      "Graydon Hoare created the Rust programming language in 2006 while working at Mozilla Research. Various significant companies, including Microsoft, Google, Meta, Discord, and Amazon, adopted the language in the 2010s for numerous purposes, resulting in the formation of the Rust Foundation in February 2021 to manage the continued development of the language.",
      "Rust developers use RS files to store their source code, then compile it with the rustc compiler included with the Rust package. Developers may also change the .rs file extension to .rs~ during the development process to signify to themselves and others that the source code is not ready to be compiled."
