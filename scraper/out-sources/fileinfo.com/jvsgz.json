      "A JVSGZ file is a compressed project file created by JVSG's CCTV (Closed-Circuit Television) system design programs. It stores a .JVSG file compressed with Zip compression.

      "JVSGZ files are used for saving video surveillance projects in a smaller size, which makes them easier to transfer to other people. If you receive a JVSGZ file you can open it with the IP Video System Design Tool (version 9.0 and later). After opening the file, the project can be used for designing security camera networks for banks, retail stores, car sales lots, and other businesses that require security cameras."
