      "Since EPUB files store their contents in a Zip-like container format, you can open them with Zip compression utilities. For example, you can open an EPUB file as a Zip archive with Windows File Explorer by renaming the .epub file extension to .zip. You can then extract its contents to view or modify them. However, remember that editing the contents in an EPUB file may corrupt the eBook."
