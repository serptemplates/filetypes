      "Instrument file used by FamiTracker, a music creation program designed for creating music for the original Nintendo Entertainment System (NES); contains instrument properties, such as volume, pitch, and arpeggio settings. Referenced when playing back the corresponding sample (such as a .DMC file) within a FamiTracker song."

      "Since most FTI files contain only instrument properties, they are typically only a few kilobytes in size. The sample files that contain the actual audio data are much larger. FTI files are typically saved alongside FamiTracker song (.FTM) files."
