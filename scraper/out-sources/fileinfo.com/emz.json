You may need to rename the .emz file extension to .emf.gz to extract the EMF file with PeaZip. After decompressing the EMZ file, you can extract the EMF file contained in the EMZ file and open it with a program that supports the EMF format, such as XnViewMP (multiplatform), Adobe Illustrator, and OpenOffice Draw (multiplatform)."
