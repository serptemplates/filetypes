      "PDB files used by different programs are usually saved in different proprietary formats, meaning they can be opened only by the program they were installed with. For example, Microsoft Visual Studio will not recognize an Intuit Quicken PDB file.",

The symbol information consists of a list of all symbols in a program module with addresses, the name of the file, and the line the symbol was declared on."
