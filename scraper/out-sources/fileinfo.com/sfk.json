      "An SFK file stores the waveform image of an audio wave (.WAV) file saved by MAGIX Sound Forge Pro or VEGAS Pro. It does not store audio data; the applications reference the SFK file to display the WAV file's waveform image. SFK files replaced .SFL files, which older versions of Sound Forge Pro create."

    "content": [
      "When opening a WAV file with Sound Forge Pro or VEGAS Pro, the software automatically creates the SFK file in the same directory as the WAV file. If another program modifies the related WAV audio file, you can regenerate the SFK peak file by selecting Rebuild Peak Data from the Special menu in Sound Forge.",
      "NOTE: Sonic Foundry initially developed Sound Forge Pro until Sony acquired the application in 2003. Then, MAGIX acquired Sound Forge Pro in 2016."
