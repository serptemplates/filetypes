      "An FSB file is an audio bank created by FMOD Designer, a discontinued program used to design video game sounds. It contains a collection of in-game music and/or sound effects. FSB files are often accompanied by .FEV files, which contain data a game uses to play sounds at the correct time."

      "Firelight Technologies FMOD Designer was a program that video game developers and sound designers used to create and package sounds for use in console and PC games. After a user finished designing their game's sounds, they would package those sounds in a single FSB archive. They could then integrate the archive, and accompanying audio event data saved in an FEV file, into their game.",
