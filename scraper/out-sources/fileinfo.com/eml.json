      "An EML file is an email message saved by an email application, such as Microsoft Outlook or Apple Mail. It contains the content of the message, along with the subject, sender, recipient(s), and date of the message. EML files may also store one or more email attachments, which are files sent with the message."

      "Microsoft developed the Electronic Mail (EML) format to comply with the industry-standard RFC 5322 for transferring messages between email clients. EML utilizes the Internet Message Format (IMF) syntax for text stored in the messages.",
      "Because of its wide adoption among email clients, EML has become one of the most common email message formats. Some other common email message file types include .MSG .MBOX, .EMLX and .DAT.",
      "Since the EML format is widely supported, you can save emails as .EML files with most email applications. Two common email applications that can save messages as EML files include Microsoft Mail and Apple Mail:",
      "Microsoft Mail - Open an email message, click the three-dot Actions icon, then select Save as",

      "You can also open EML files with various web browsers, including Google Chrome (multiplatform), Microsoft Edge, and Internet Explorer since they are formatted similar to .MHT files. You can change the .eml file extension to .mht and open it directly with the web browser.",
      "Since EML files are partially saved in plain text format, you can open them with a plain text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad and Apple TextEdit. However, you may need to change the .eml file extension to .txt. Remember that text editors will not natively display EML files like an email application."
