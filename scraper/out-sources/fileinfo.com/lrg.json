      "An LRG file is a bitmap image created by Macromedia xRes, a discontinued image editor. It contains an image and a record of any layers added to that image. The LRG format was one of the first image formats to support layer-based editing."

      "xRes was an image-editing program available for Windows and macOS. It was originally published by Fauve Software, before Macromedia acquired Fauve. Macromedia released the last version of xRes, xRes 3.0, in 1997.",
      "Layer-based images created in xRes can be saved as LRG files. This format preserves the image's layers, so users can continue editing those layers in the future. A layer might include text, shapes, or other objects that a user placed in their image."
