For this feature to work, the audio file must use the same filename as the M2V file and reside in the same folder. For example, if an audio file named FileInfoExample.wav is located in the same folder as FileInfoExample.m2v, and you play FileInfoExample.m2v in Media Player Classic, Media Player Classic will also play FileInfoExample.wav.",
