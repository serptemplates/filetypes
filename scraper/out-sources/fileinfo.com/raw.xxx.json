      "Dolphin is a Nintendo GameCube and Wii emulator that gamers use to play GameCube and Wii games on their PCs. Those using Dolphin to play Wii games can use a .RAW file as a virtual SD card. Just as the Nintendo Wii loads data from and saves data to a physical SD card, Dolphin loads data from and saves data to RAW files.",
      "While Dolphin is writing data to a player's RAW file, it appends the .xxx extension to that file. This signals that a player should not close Dolphin or move or modify their RAW file, since it is currently being written to. After Dolphin finishes writing data to a .raw.xxx file, it removes the .xxx extension from that file's name."
