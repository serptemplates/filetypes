It consists of one or more raster or vector layers, which may include shapes, text, filters, images, and pen, pencil, or brush strokes.

      "Illustrators use Clip Studio Paint to create comics, illustrations, and animations. The program saves illustrators' images as CLIP files. CLIP files are layer-based images, which are similar to Adobe Photoshop's .PSD files.",
