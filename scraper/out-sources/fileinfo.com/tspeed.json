      "A TSPEED file is a settings file created by TyperSpeed Sepia, a typing game for Windows. TyperSpeed Sepia uses a player's TSPEED file (settings.tspeed or sepia.tspeed) to load their game settings. TSPEED files are plain text files that you can open and edit with any text editor."

      "TyperSpeed Sepia is a typing game in which players have 35 seconds to type as many words as possible without making mistakes. When a player first opens TyperSpeed Sepia, the game creates a TSPEED file, which stores the game's settings. In TyperSpeed Sepia 3.5 and above, the file is named sepia.tspeed. In earlier versions, it is named settings.tspeed.",
      "In version 3.6C and later, players can alter TyperSpeed Sepia's settings by selecting S. Enter the settings menu. from the main menu (select 6. Enter the settings menu. in version 3.5). When a player alters TyperSpeed Sepia's settings, the game automatically saves the player's new settings in their TSPEED file.",
      "Additionally, in Typerspeed Sepia 3.5 and above, if a player connected TyperSpeed to their Twitter account, the game stored their Twitter access token data in tweepia.tspeed. However, Twitter no longer allows Typerspeed players to connect to their accounts.",
      "NOTE: TyperSpeed Sepia is the first version of TyperSpeed to use TSPEED files. Previous versions did not create or use TSPEED files."
