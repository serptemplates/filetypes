      "An SLS file is an image playlist that stores a list of file paths to images included in a slideshow presentation. It is a plain text file that discontinued programs like My Photo Gallery referenced to ensure images are displayed in a specific order without altering the image files."

    "content": [
      "Individuals and organizations, such as photographers, event organizers, and businesses, previously used SLS files to display a sequence of images during presentations, exhibitions, or digital signage displays. Now, modern slideshow software typically uses more common formats like .XML, .JSON, or proprietary project files to manage image sequences, not SLS files. Additionally, many popular applications, such as Microsoft PowerPoint, Google Slides, and Adobe Lightroom, have built-in slideshow features that do not require separate playlist files."
