      "An LQX file is a memo created by QuickMemo+, an app installed on select LG smartphones. It contains an image, as well as annotations made to that image. Typically, the images that LQX files contain are screenshots from a user's phone or tablet."

      "Certain LG devices, such as the G7, Phoenix 4, and Escape 2, come with QuickMemo+ pre-installed. This LG-exclusive app allows users to take a screenshot and write or draw on it, before saving it as a memo. These memos are saved as LQX files.",
      "While LQX files appear as a single image in QuickMemo+, they are actually renamed .ZIP files, which store a memo's constituent image layers and metadata files. Thus, if you do not have access to QuickMemo+, you can rename an LQX file to use the .zip extension and extract its contents as you would any ZIP file.",
      "Each LQX file's contents include:",
      "An images directory, which contains the original, screenshotted image and the final, annotated image",
      "A drawings directory, which saves a copy of the user's annotations",

      "If you do not have access to QuickMemo+ and want to view an LQX file's contents:",
      "Rename the file to use the .zip extension.",
      "Decompress it using 7-Zip (Windows), Apple Archive Utility (Mac), or any other Zip-decompression utility.",
