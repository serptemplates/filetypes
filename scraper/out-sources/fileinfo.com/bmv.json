      "A BMV file is a video used by Discworld II: Missing Presumed..!? or Discworld Noir, video games published by Teeny Weeny Games. It contains a full-motion video that plays during one of the games' cutscenes. BMV files cannot be played by most popular media players, so if you want to play the files outside the game in which they are used, you must convert them to a standard video format."

      "In 1996, Teeny Weeny Games (now known as Perfect Entertainment) released Discworld II, the second of a series of point-and-click adventure games based on Terry Pratchett's Discworld novels. Discworld II and its sequel, Discworld Noir, played in-game cutscenes that were saved as BMV video files. Discworld II and Discworld Noir used differently-formatted BMV files, even though both games' cutscenes were saved with the .bmv extension. For example, Discworld II's BMV files did not contain a header, while Discworld Noir's BMV files did."
