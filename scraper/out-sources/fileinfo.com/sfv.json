      "You can use QuickSFV (Windows, Linux), Traction SFV Checker (Windows), and checkSum+ (Mac) to compare the checksums an SFV file contains against a file set's actual checksums. For example, in SFV Checker, you can add your files to the program's file list, open your SFV file, and compare your files' checksums to those listed in the SFV file. This will tell you whether the files you received are identical to the files used to produce the checksums listed in your SFV file.",
      "If you do not want to open your SFV file in a checksum utility, you can instead open it in any text editor, to view the list of filenames and checksums it contains."
