      "A B5T file is a data file used by VSO Software BlindWrite, a program designed to create backup copies of optical discs, such as CDs and DVDs. It contains metadata in the XML standard, such as track information and details about the structure of the disc, helping BlindWrite accurately reproduce the original disc during the copying process."

    "content": [
      "Users of B5T files are typically individuals who want to back up or clone discs with BlindWrite for personal use. For example, a person who works with software, games, music, or video discs and wants to preserve their data may encounter B5T files.",
      "B5T files are usually saved alongside a related .B5I file, which stores the main image data of the disc. Compared to the B5I file, the B5T file is relatively small because it only stores metadata about the disc tracks, such as their start and end points, rather than the actual content. Together, these files provide all the information BlindWrite needs to create a precise copy of the original disc."

      "Since B5T files store text in the XML standard, you can also open and edit them with an XML or plain text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit."
