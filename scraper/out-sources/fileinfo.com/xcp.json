      "Each XCP file is an encrypted .CAB archive that contains all a content package's resources and assets. Several Xbox 360 enthusiasts have attempted to create utilities that allow them to extract, view, and modify XCP files' contents. However, their efforts have largely been unsuccessful. Therefore, in most cases, you will not be able to open an XCP file to view its contents.",
