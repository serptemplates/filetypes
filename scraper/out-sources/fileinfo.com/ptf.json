      "A PTF file is a page template used by Scrapbook Flair, a digital scrapbooking program developed by Aimee Aspell. It contains layout information used to create scrapbook pages, including the arrangement of images, text boxes, and decorative elements. PTF files allow users to start new projects with a predefined design rather than building each page from scratch."

    "content": [
      "Each PTF file may also include background themes, borders, and embellishments that match a particular visual style. When opened in Scrapbook Flair, users can replace placeholder content—such as sample photos or text—with their own. This makes the format useful for both beginner and experienced scrapbookers who want to produce consistent and visually organized scrapbook pages."
