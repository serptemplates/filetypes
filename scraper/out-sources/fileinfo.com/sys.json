      "System files are most commonly found within the C:\\​Windows directory of a Windows installation. If you have Windows Vista or a later version installed the bulk of your SYS files will be located in the following directories:",

      "Windows\\​winsxs",
      "You may also encounter SYS files when trying to correct a device driver issue in Windows. The device driver, which is a program that enables Windows to interact with hardware, such as a keyboard, printer, or monitor, may have been deleted, become corrupt, or need to be updated.",
      "Ideally, you should update device drivers via Windows Update to fix these issues. You can do this by selecting Settings → Update & Security → Windows Update → Check for updates → View optional updates → Driver updates.",
      "However, you may need to manually update a device driver with an update package you downloaded from the device manufacturer's website. In this case, you can use the Device Manager included with Windows.",
      "After extracting the package's contents (typically stored in a .ZIP archive) with the appropriate decompression utility, you will most likely encounter an .INF file accompanied by one or more SYS files. Follow these instructions to update the device driver with Device Manager:",
      "Open the Start menu, type \"Device Manager,\" then open the tool.",
      "Open the branch with the hardware you need to update, then right-click the specific hardware, and select Update driver.",
      "Select \"Browse my computer for drivers\" and navigate to the location of the extracted update package files by clicking the Browse... button. Verify that the \"Include subfolders\" option is checked to make sure it can find the INF file, which stores the update instructions.",
      "Finally, click Next. Device Manager will then scan, detect, and install the extracted update package that includes the INF and SYS file(s).",
      "NOTE: Since \"sys\" is short for \"system,\" SYS files are commonly pronounced as \"siss\" files."
