      "PDZ files are not meant to be opened. Instead, users load PDZ files onto the Playdate handheld console. Once transferred to the device (usually via USB or sideloading through the Playdate account system), the console reads and runs the PDZ file as a complete game.",
      "Developers may also run PDZ in the Playdate Simulator, a desktop application included with the SDK, which emulates the Playdate console on Windows, macOS, and Linux. They can run PDZ files with playdate.file.load() and playdate.file.run() in the SDK."
