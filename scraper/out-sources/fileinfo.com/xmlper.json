    "description": [
      "An XMLPER file contains data captured by LeCroy oscilloscopes. It stores binary data representing electrical signals the oscilloscope or an analysis program uses to recreate a waveform. The XMLper file format is commonly used in electrical engineering and signal analysis."

      "A LeCroy oscilloscope is an electronic test instrument that measures and visualizes electrical signals. Electronics, engineering, and research industries commonly use the device to capture, display, and analyze the waveforms of electrical signals in real time. They may use it for tasks, such as debugging circuits, testing components, verifying signal integrity, and troubleshooting electrical systems.",
      "Oscilloscopes work by plotting an electrical signal's voltage over time on a screen, allowing engineers and technicians to observe the signal's shape, frequency, amplitude, and other characteristics. LeCroy oscilloscope users can save waveform data as XMLPER files and transfer them for further processing or for sharing between devices.",
      "NOTE: The XMLper format is uncommon now as newer technologies and formats have emerged, such as .CSV."
