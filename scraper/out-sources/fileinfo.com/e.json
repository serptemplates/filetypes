      "Developer and Eiffel Software founder Bertrand Meyer created the Eiffel programming language. With Eiffel, Meyer set out to design a language that could be used to create reliable, reusable software modules. To that end, Eiffel is structured around design by contract, a concept in which a software system is defined as a set of components interacting through precisely-specified contracts.",

Each class contains features, which are similar to the routines, attributes, or methods used by other object-oriented programming languages. Features can be used to execute one of Eiffel's five basic instructions:",
