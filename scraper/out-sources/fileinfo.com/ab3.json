      "An AB3 file is an image album created by version 3 of Ulead PhotoImpact. It contains references to the images included in the album, but does not contain the images themselves. When you open an AB3 file in PhotoImpact, the program uses the references and other information the AB3 file contains to load and organize the album's images."

      "PhotoImpact is a discontinued image editing program that was published by Ulead, before being acquired by Corel. Ulead released version 3 of PhotoImpact in 1996.",
      "In PhotoImpact version 3, users could save an album of edited images as an AB3 file. However, these files do not contain the images themselves, but only information used to load the images. Thus, if you move an image referenced in an AB3 file, PhotoImpact will not be able to load that image when loading the AB3 file."

      "You can open an AB3 file with versions 3 and above of Ulead PhotoImpact (Windows). However, PhotoImpact is discontinued. Thus, if you do not already have access to PhotoImpact, you likely will not be able to open your AB3 file."
