      "An MP5 file is a video that is meant to be played on a Chinese MP5 portable media player. MP5 files are not significantly different from .MP4 files. Like MP4 files, MP5 files are encoded using the MPEG-4 or MPEG-H codecs. The only difference between MP5 files and MP4 files is that MP5 files are often encoded such that they are optimized for MP5 media players."

    "content": [
      "In an attempt to set themselves apart from other media players, many Chinese portable media players advertise themselves as \"MP5 players.\" However, there is no real MP5 file format. The MP5 files these media players use are simply renamed MP4 files. Most MP5 files are encoded using the H.264/AVC, or MPEG-4, codec. Thus, if you change the files' extension to .mp4, you can often play them in any MP4 media player."

      "You can play MP5 videos as-is in some Chinese media players, such as Baidu Player and QvodPlayer. However, the easiest way to play an MP5 file is likely to change its extension to .mp4 and play it an MP4 media player, such as VideoLAN VLC media player."
