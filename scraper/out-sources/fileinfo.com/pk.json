      "A PK file contains the visual representation of an audio waveform for a corresponding audio file. Audition and Cool Edit Pro automatically generate a PK file when a user imports a .WAV audio file and saves it in the same folder as the original audio file. Adobe replaced PK files with .PKF files when it released Audition version 4 (CS5.5)."

    "content": [
      "By default, peak files are generated for all audio files opened in Audition 2.0. This speeds up the waveform display process since the waveform only needs to be generated the first time. You may turn off the automatic peak file generation by choosing Edit → Preferences → Display, then deselecting Save Peak Cache Files.",
