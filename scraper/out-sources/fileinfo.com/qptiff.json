      "A QPTIFF file is a slide specimen image created by a PerkinElmer Vectra imaging system. It contains a scanned, pyramidal image of a tissue microarray (TMA) or other pathological specimen. The images that QPTIFF files contain are .TIFF images that use additional proprietary metadata."

    "content": [
      "Pathologists use Vectra pathology imaging systems to create multispectral images of TMAs, which usually contain tumor tissue or other cancerous tissues. These images, which are saved as QPTIFF files, are actually comprised of multiple TIFF images saved at varying resolutions. Saving images in this pyramidal format allows pathologists to zoom in and out on an image without losing any image quality."
