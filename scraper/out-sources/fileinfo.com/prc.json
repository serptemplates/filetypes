      "A PRC file is a 3D model saved in the Product Representation Compact (PRC) format. It contains a 3D representation of a mechanical product or assembly. Previous versions of Adobe Acrobat allowed users to convert many 3D model file types to the PRC format, so the models could be embedded in .PDF files."

      "Adobe Systems developed the PRC file format to allow engineers, architects, and other CAD software users to more easily share 3D models with each other, as part of PDF-based documentation workflows. Each PRC file contains a product's structure, geometry, and product manufacturing information (PMI).",
      "Adobe Acrobat Pro Extended 8 and 9 and Adobe Acrobat 3D allowed users to create PRC files and embed them in PDF files. Current versions of Acrobat do not allow users to create new PRC files, but they can still open, view, and embed previously-created PRC files."
