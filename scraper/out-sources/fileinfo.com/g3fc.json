      "A G3FC file is an archive that stores one or more files in the Generation 3 File Container (G3FC) format. It is compressed with the open-source Zstandard (Zstd) compression algorithm. The G3FC format also supports Forward Error Correction (FEC) to help recover from data corruption, and optional AES-256-GCM encryption to protect the contents of the archive."

      "G3Pix introduced the G3FC format in 2025 to be a secure, high-performance file storage and transfer option. G3FC archives include dedicated footers, which allow programs to quickly list the contents of a G3FC file without scanning the entire archive. This feature improves speed and usability in applications that handle large or complex archives.",
      "NOTE: You may encounter G3FC files in situations where data security and integrity are important, such as transferring sensitive files, distributing software packages, or archiving data for long-term storage."
