      "A TLB file is a library used by the Virtual Memory System (VMS) operating system for Virtual Address eXtension (VAX) computers. It stores plain text information, such as configuration settings, system documentation, or program libraries, to ensure the operating system functions correctly."

      "Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) developed VAX/VMS systems, with VAX being a line of minicomputers and VMS being the operating system designed to run on them. These systems were widely used in academic, scientific, and business settings during the 1980s and 1990s for various tasks, including large-scale computations and resource management.",
      "DEC renamed VMS/VAX to OpenVMS in 1992 and eventually discontinued the system, making TLB files obscure. However, some organizations still use OpenVMS, which also still supports TLB files.",
      "NOTE: While VMS typically uses TLB files, applications running on the system may also use them to ensure they run correctly."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You should not attempt to open TLB files. Instead, the VMS system or applications running on the system reference them.",
      "However, if you want to view the information TLB files contain, you can open TLB files with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit."
