      "An NLT file is a Windows system file used to map one language's writing system to another, in a process called transliteration. It contains text and binary data that associates characters used in one language with characters used in another. NLT files are found in the C:/​Windows/​Globalization/​ELS/​Transliteration directory."

      "As part of its Globalization Services, Windows includes Extended Linguistic Services (ELS) that are implemented as a dynamic link library (DLL). When developers create internationalized Windows apps, they can reference Windows' ELS to perform certain functions, including automatically mapping UTF-16 characters used in one language to characters used in another language.",
      "To map characters between languages, Windows uses NLT files. These files are often named after the languages they link. For example, the first NLT file listed in the C:/​~/​ELS/​Transliteration directory is named bengali-to-latin.nlt."
