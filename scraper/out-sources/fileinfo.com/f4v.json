      "An F4V file is a video file saved in the video container format used by Adobe Flash. It stores video encoded in the H.264 codec, audio in the AAC+/HE-AAC/AAC v1/AAC v2 formats, and metadata. F4V files are primarily used to stream movies and TV shows online."

    "content": [
      "The F4V container format was introduced in 2007 with the release of Flash Player 9 Update 3 (9,0,115,0). It is based on the ISO MP4 format, which is based on the Apple QuickTime container format, and is specified by ISO/IEC 14496-12 as a base media file format.",
      "F4V files are similar to Flash Video .FLV files, but use \"boxes\" to store data. Examples of boxes supported by the F4V format are the ftyp box (player requirements), the moov box (file header and the F4V file must contain only one), the mvhd box (playback information), the trak box (media tracks), the uda box (free-form user data), the meta box (metadata), and several others."
