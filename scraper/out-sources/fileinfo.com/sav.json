      "You can open a SAV file with various Nintendo DS emulators in Windows, macOS, and Linux, including NO$GBA, iDeaS Emulator, and DeSmuME. For example, to open a SAV file with the macOS version of DeSmuME, place the file in the same location as the NDS ROM file, open the NDS ROM file with the emulator, and click File → Import ROM Save File (emulators may not support raw SAV files transferred from Nintendo DS devices).",
      "Additionally, you can open and modify SAV files with a hex editor, such as HxD. Remember that opening the SAV file with a hex editor displays binary data, not the emulated game."
