      "IWD files are not meant to be opened. Instead, Activision Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 4 reference the data in the files.",
      "However, since IWD files are Zip-compressed, you can open them and extract their contents with a Zip utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer (Windows), Apple Archive Utility (macOS), or Corel WinZip (Windows). However, you should not modify IWD files unless you know the correct changes to make. Altering an IWD file may make it unusable by Call of Duty."
