      "An SSM file is a metadata file used by RealPlayer, a media player application. It contains information that directs RealPlayer to the location of streaming media on a server (it does not store the actual media data being streamed). RealPlayer references SSM files to stream content without needing to download the entire multimedia file, providing faster playback and conserving storage space on the computer."
