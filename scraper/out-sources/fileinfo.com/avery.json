      "Design & Print Online is a label design software that runs as a Flash application in a web browser. It allows users to save prints from a web browser in the AVERY file then load them through the web application. After a design is created, an AVERY file can be saved to the local computer through the Avery Design & Print Online web interface. The file can be loaded in the same interface to restore the design back to its saved state.",
      "Designs created in Avery Design & Print Online can be output to the .PDF format and then printed on any standard printer. When you are ready to print, select Print in the top-right corner, choose to save or not save your design, then click Download PDF to download your design as a .PDF file."
