      "However, you may be able to open WR1 files with Corel WordPerfect or Corel Quattro Pro. When opened in these programs, the spreadsheet formatting will most likely not be correct, but you will still be able to view the data and save it in a more widely supported format. When attempting to open the WR1 file in either of these programs, be sure to set the file type option to \"All Files (*.*)\" in the dropdown menu in the Open window."
