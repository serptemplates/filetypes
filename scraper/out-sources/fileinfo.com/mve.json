      "You will most likely only encounter an MVE video if you have installed one of the PC games that utilize the MVE format, such as Baldur's Gate, Baldur's Gate II, Planescape: Torment, Icewind Dale, and Icewind Dale II. You may also receive an MVE file from a friend who played one of these games and is trying to share an old MVE file.",
      "The MVE format is primarily known as \"Interplay MVE.\" However, it may also be referred to as \"Infinity Engine Movie,\" which comes from \"Infinity Engine,\" the game engine featured in games that use MVE files.",
      "Infinity Engine was developed by BioWare. Interplay Entertainment licensed the game engine from BioWare to develop and release most of the games that use MVE files.",
      "NOTE: MVE files may also appear with the .mv8 file extension."

      "MVE files are uncommon since they are no longer used in Infinity Engine games, and few programs support the file type.
