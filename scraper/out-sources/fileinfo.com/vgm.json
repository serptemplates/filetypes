      "A VGM file contains music played in a video game. Gamers use various sound logging utilities to convert a game's music to VGM files.

      "After converting a game's music to a set of VGM files, gamers can play that music with various audio players. This allows gamers to listen to a game's soundtrack on their PCs. Gamers may also distribute VGM files that they've created online, so others can download and use them.",
      "In many cases, the music that a VGM file contains was meant to be played by a Yamaha or Texas Instrument sound chip, included in a classic arcade cabinet or console. However, VGM files may contain music meant to be played by other types of sound chips (such as Nintendo, Konami, Namco, Atari, and Capcom sound chips)."
