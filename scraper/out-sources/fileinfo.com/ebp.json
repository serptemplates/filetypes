      "An EBP file is a project file created in Express Burn, a disc-burning application developed by NCH Software. It contains an XML-formatted list of files that a user intends to burn to a disc. EBP files do not contain any component files; they contain only references to the files a user intends to burn to a disc."

      "Express Burn is a disc-burning software that allows users to store their audio, video, and other files on CDs, DVDs, or Blu-ray discs. As users assemble the list of files they want to burn to a disc, they can save that list as an Express Burn Project, or EBP file.",
      "An EBP file consists of XML-formatted text that refers to the folders and files a user intends to burn to a disc. It does not, however, actually contain those files. So if, for example, a user were to move a video referenced in an EBP file before attempting to burn the video to a disc, Express Burn would fail to burn the video to the disc, because the video is no longer located in the referenced location."

To do so, open Express Burn and select File → Open Project from the program's menu bar. If you want to view an EBP file's contents outside Express Burn, you can open it in any text editor."
