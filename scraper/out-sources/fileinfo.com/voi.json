      "A VOI file is a collection of Volumes of Interest (VOIs), which define three-dimensional regions of interest (ROIs) on brain scans, such as MRI or PET images. It is created by BrainMaker, a medical imaging program, and is saved and managed through the VOIGroup Manager, a component within BrainMaker that allows researchers and clinicians to organize and analyze sets of VOIs."

    "content": [
      "Medical researchers, neuroscientists, and healthcare professionals working with advanced imaging data are the primary users of VOI files. The purpose of a VOI file is to make it easier to study specific brain regions by grouping them for comparison, measurement, or visualization.",
      "For example, a researcher might create VOIs around areas affected by a neurological disorder to track changes across multiple scans. Saving these regions in a VOI file allows consistent analysis across different imaging sessions.",
      "NOTE: NeuroInfo Lite replaced BrainMaker, and does not support VOI files."
