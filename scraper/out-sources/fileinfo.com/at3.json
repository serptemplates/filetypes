      "An AT3 file is an audio file saved in Sony’s Adaptive Transform Acoustic Coding 3 (ATRAC3) compression format. It stores music or game audio used on devices such as the PlayStation Portable (PSP), Sony CD and MP3 players, and Sony Ericsson mobile phones. AT3 files were also embedded in game directories, particularly on the PSP, to store background music and sound effects in Sony-developed games."

  "technical_info": {

      "Sony developed the ATRAC3 format to reduce audio file size while maintaining acceptable sound quality, making it suitable for portable devices. Additionally, Sony commonly used ATRAC3 in the early 2000s for storing music on MiniDiscs, MP3 players, and other portable media devices.",
      "Users often managed and transferred AT3 files between a computer and portable Sony devices with SonicStage software (developed by Sony). Today, AT3 files are less common, and support for the ATRAC3 format has largely been discontinued in favor of more widely supported audio formats, such as .MP3 and .AAC.",
      "NOTE: Users may also encounter similar formats, such as .AA3 and .OMG files, which are related to ATRAC3 and sometimes include Digital Rights Management (DRM) to control playback."
