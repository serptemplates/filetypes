      "A VSA file is an animatronics choreography project created by Brookshire Software Visual Show Automation. It contains a set of timeline-organized events used to automatically control one or more animatronic, lighting, audio, or video devices. Primarily, VSA files are used to control devices during audiovisual performances, shows, and other productions."

      "Visual Show Automation is a Windows program that audiovisual designers can use to automate device functions during productions. For example, a designer can connect Visual Show Automation to an animatronic character, a lighting system, and a sound system, to control the character's movements, the lighting system's display, and the sound system's playback.",
      "In Visual Show Automation, designers specify the series of events each connected device should perform during a production, by adding those events to a timeline. Designers then save the project file they've created as a VSA file. Doing so allows them to quickly open and play the VSA file during a production and, if necessary, edit the project in the future.",
      "NOTE: MonkeyBasic TrackSkull can also create VSA files, for use with Visual Show Automation."
