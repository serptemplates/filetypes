    "description": [
      "A CMDB file is a mesh file created by Ansys Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) software. It contains a 3D model used to simulate a fluid's interaction with a real-world object or system. CMDB files were most commonly used by ANSYS CFX, but current versions of CFX cannot open CMDB files."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "Engineers use Ansys CFD software to simulate how fluids will flow against and interact with a real-world object or system, such as a vehicle, building, or sewage system. Before these engineers can perform their simulations, they must create 3D models (often called meshes) of the object or system they wish to test. In old versions of Ansys CFX and other Ansys CFD software, engineers saved these models in CMDB files. However, current versions of ANSYS CFD software no longer support CMDB files.",
      "NOTE: The acronym CMDB can also refer to configuration management databases. If you possess a non-ANSYS CMDB file, it is likely related to a configuration management database."
