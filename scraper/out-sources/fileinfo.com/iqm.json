      "IQM files are not meant to be opened. Instead, IQM files are included in the game's or app's data package (alongside textures, maps, and other assets), and the game engine then loads the IQM file directly to render and animate models during gameplay.",
      "While players typically don't interact with IQM files themselves, modders and developers may open or replace them to change in-game characters, weapons, or objects. For example, you can open IQM files with various tools, such as the IQM model viewer (provided by the format creator) or with Blender, which supports IQM through community plugins and scripts."
