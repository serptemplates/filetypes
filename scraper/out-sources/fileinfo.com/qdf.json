      "Quicken is a personal finance application for managing and tracking multiple financial accounts. Before the 2010 version of Quicken, the software saved user data in a series of files, all sharing the same filename but with different extensions (e.g., QDF, .IDX, .QEL, and .QPH). Intuit introduced the single-file version of the QDF format in the Windows 2010 version of Quicken to store all the data previously stored by the separate files.",
      "While the Windows version saves user data as QDF files, the Mac version of Quicken saves user data as a .quicken file, followed by the version of Quicken that saved it. For example, the 2017 version of Quicken saves user data as .QUICKEN2017 files.",
      "Additionally, if you are using the Windows version of Quicken, you can back up QDF files as .QDF-BACKUP files. The Mac version of Quicken saves QDF backups as quicken.backup files."
