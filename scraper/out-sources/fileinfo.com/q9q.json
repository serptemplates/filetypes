      "A Q9Q file contains presets used by BladePro and SuperBladePro, which are programs used to create 2D and 3D surface and texture effects, such as glass, metal, and gel. It stores settings for effects that are applied to images and text. Q9Q files may be customized by a user or packaged with the program."

      "A Q9Q file is commonly distributed in a .ZIP file with several other files, including at least two .BMP images and a \"readme\" .TXT file. The file is primarily associated with BladePro but may also be used by SuperBladePro, which improved upon the capabilities of BladePro.",
      ".Q5Q files are the main file extension associated with SuperBladePro. You can convert a Q9Q file to Q5Q by opening it in SuperBladePro and saving it as a Q5Q file.",
      "SuperBladePro was originally available as a program but is now a plug-in filter that works with select applications, such as Adobe Photoshop and Corel PaintShop Pro. You can download the plugin from the Flaming Pear Software website."
