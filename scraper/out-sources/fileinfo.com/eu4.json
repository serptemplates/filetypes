      "If you want to edit the text an EU4 file contains, you can open it in Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, or any other text editor. Note that, because EU4 files are typically quite large, the file may take several minutes to load. If your EU4 file is compressed, you must first change its extension to .ZIP and decompress it, before you can edit the data it contains."
