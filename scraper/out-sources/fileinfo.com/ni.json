      "An NI file contains Inform 7 (I7) source code, and possibly Inform 6 (I6) source code, that can be compiled into an Interactive Fiction (IF) program by Inform 7, an IDE used to create IF programs. It stores plain text with Unicode UTF-8 encoding in I7 or I6 syntax that outlines the rules and behaviors for how a program can be played along with descriptions of playable game objects."

      "IF programs can be classified as literary video games. They are like reading through a book, but you can play through the narrative by controlling characters with text commands and interacting with the environment in the story. Inform is a free application that provides tools for creating and sharing custom IF stories that other users can experience.",
      "You can define your playable IF program in an NI source code file. Then, you can compile it with Inform 7 into a playable file, such as a .GBLORB or .ZBLORB file.",
      "You can create an NI file with any text editor. When you save the file, save it with the .ni file extension. You may need to instead save the file as a .TXT file, then manually change the .txt file extension to .ni.",
      "NOTE: NI source code files were introduced with the release of Inform 7, replacing .INF source code files. The files may also be saved as the less common I7 files."

      "You can open an NI file with Inform 7, then compile it by selecting \"Go!\" from the user interface.",
      "Since NI files are saved in plain text, you can also open them with a plain text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (macOS), and edit them. Also, Microsoft Visual Studio Code (multiplatform) is a useful source code editor that includes helpful syntax editing capabilities for viewing and editing NI files."
