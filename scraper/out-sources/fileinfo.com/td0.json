      "A TD0 file is a disk image created using Teledisk, a utility originally for archiving and duplicating floppy disks in the 1980s and 90s. It stores an exact copy of a floppy disk’s contents, including its files and low-level disk structure. TD0 files are compressed to reduce storage size, which was especially important when dealing with limited disk space in the 1980s and 90s."

      "Sydex initially developed the TD0 format for backing up, distributing, and preserving software stored on 3.5-inch and 5.25-inch floppy disks. New Technologies Inc. later acquired Teledisk before discontinuing it.",
      "A common use of TD0 files was to store sound libraries for Akai S-series samplers, including S900, S1000, and S3000, which were popular in the 1980s and 1990s. Akai adopted the format to create and transfer exact copies of sample disks, which preserved sounds and settings. However, they are no longer prevalent."
