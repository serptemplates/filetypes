      "A CXX file is a source code file written in the C++ programming language. It may store code for a standalone program or components that can be included in other C++ source files. Developers typically view and edit CXX files with a source code editor, then compile them with a compiler to machine code that can be run as a program on the target platform."

      "C++ is one of the most common programming languages, with developers using it to create various applications, such as database management software, image editors, games, and web browsers. Bjarne Stroustrup developed C++ to improve upon the C programming language and released it in 1985. It grew quickly in adoption and is now maintained by the Standard C++ Foundation.",
      "The .cxx file extension is one of several extensions you may encounter appended to files storing C++ source code. Other extensions for C++ files include .CPP, .CC, and .C (stores C and C++) source code files."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open and edit CXX files with several source code editors, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code (multiplatform) and Code Blocks (multiplatform). These applications are common choices for viewing and editing CXX files since they provide helpful tools, such as syntax highlighting and auto-completion.",
      "You can also open and edit CXX files with plain text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad (bundled with Windows) or Apple TextEdit (bundled with macOS). However, these text editors do not provide helpful source code editing features included with source code editors.",
      "You can compile the C++ code stored in CXX files to machine code run on a computer with various free and commercial compilers. Some compiler options include Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows), GNU Compiler Collection (multiplatform), Eclipse IDE for C Developers (multiplatform), and Apple Xcode (macOS)."
