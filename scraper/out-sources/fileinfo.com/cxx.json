      "You can open and edit CXX files with several source code editors, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code (multiplatform) and Code Blocks (multiplatform). These applications are common choices for viewing and editing CXX files since they provide helpful tools, such as syntax highlighting and auto-completion.",
      "You can also open and edit CXX files with plain text editors, such as Microsoft Notepad (bundled with Windows) or Apple TextEdit (bundled with macOS). However, these text editors do not provide helpful source code editing features included with source code editors.",
      "You can compile the C++ code stored in CXX files to machine code run on a computer with various free and commercial compilers. Some compiler options include Microsoft Visual Studio (Windows), GNU Compiler Collection (multiplatform), Eclipse IDE for C Developers (multiplatform), and Apple Xcode (macOS)."
