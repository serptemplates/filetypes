      "A GD3 file is a genealogy data file created by GreatProgs GreatFamily, a program used to design and record family tree genealogy. It contains information about a family, which includes a graphical representation of how each person is related, along with a database that stores information about each individual in the family tree."

      "GD3 files are obscure since the program is no longer developed and was not very popular back in the 2000s. However, you may still encounter a GD3 file if you had previously documented family information with the GreatFamily program. You may also acquire a GD3 file sent to you by another family member that designed a family tree with the software.",
      "To open a GD3 file with GreatFamily, select File → Open. To create a GD3 file with GreatFamily, select File → New, then click File → Save or Save As.",
      "Since GreatFamily is no longer developed and not widely used, you may want to convert the information saved in your GD3 file to a more widely supported format. To export a GD3 file to a .GED file with GreatFamily, select File → Export to GEDCOM file."
