      "Mobile devices, such as Android and iOS mobile phones, store a variety of information in DB database files. For example, a DB file may contain your contacts, your SMS information, or other device or application data. DB files are commonly saved in a SQLite database format, but they are also commonly locked or encrypted, so you cannot access or edit their data."
