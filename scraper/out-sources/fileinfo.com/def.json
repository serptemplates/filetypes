      "A DEF file is a game data file used by M.U.G.E.N (or just Mugen), a free sprite-based game engine used for making 2D fighting games. It contains the definition for a character, which includes the character name and version information. DEF files also store the character specification files (.CNS, .SFF, .CMD, .SND, and .AIR) used by the engine."
