      "An SLDDRW file is a 2D drawing created by Dassault Systemes SolidWorks. It contains a vector drawing of a SolidWorks part (.SLDPRT file) or assembly (.SLDASM file). Engineers and product designers use SLDDRW files to share drawings and annotations with each other."

      "SolidWorks is a popular CAD program that engineers and product designers use to prototype manufactured products, such as vehicle parts, tools, and other instruments. After creating a 3D representation of a part or product in SolidWorks, users can export a 2D drawing of that part or product. The drawing usually contains multiple 2D views of the part, as well as measurements, noted tolerances, and other annotations.",
      "By default, SolidWorks saves drawings as SLDDRW files. Users can also convert SolidWorks drawings to other, more common file formats, to make them easier for others to open and view."
