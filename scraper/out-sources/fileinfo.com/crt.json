      "To host secure websites, web server administrators typically apply for digital certificates from third-party Certificate Authorities, such as GoDaddy, Verisign, or Thawte. These certificates are saved in various formats, including the CRT format.",
      "After receiving a certificate, administrators must place it on their web server, within the website they want to secure. When a user accesses the site, the web server passes the certificate to the user's web browser, to verify the site's identity. (If a browser cannot verify a certificate, it may instead show a page that says \"This website's certificate is expired.\")",
