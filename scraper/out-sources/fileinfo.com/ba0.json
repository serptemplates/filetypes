      "A BA0 file contains a backup of a tax return created with TaxAct 2020, a Windows tax-preparation program for the 2020 tax year. It stores 2020 1040 annual income tax data, which includes the filing user's personal information and federal IRS and state tax form data. BA0 files are used for archival purposes and as a backup to the .TA0 tax return file in the event that it is lost or becomes corrupt."

      "To manually save a backup of your tax return with TaxAct 2020, select File → Backup... and name your file. You must save your tax return as a TA0 file before creating your backup.",
      "TaxAct 2020 automatically generates three types of BA0 tax return backup files and stores them in the \"AUTO-BACKUP\" folder. The three types are the current backup, a daily backup, and a weekly backup. You can tell the type from the filename. For example, the daily BA0 backup file for a 2020 tax return is .ta0_daily.ba0."
