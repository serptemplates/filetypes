      "A TMAP file is a project file created by TissUUmaps, a tissue analysis tool. It contains JSON-formatted data that specifies a project's included image layers, markers, regions, and settings. Users can create TMAP files by saving projects in TissUUmaps or exporting them from other tissue-related programs."

      "Researchers use TissUUmaps to visualize and analyze data from tissue samples. The program was created by a group at Uppsala University in Sweden, and it is available for download online.",
      "To create a TissUUmaps project, researchers first load one or more images saved in one of the program's supported whole slide image formats (such as .TIF, .VMU, .SCN, or .SVSLIDE). They can then apply filters, add markers, and draw regions on each image, to aid them in performing their analysis.",
      "At any time, a user can save their current TissUUmap project as a TMAP file. This file contains a JSON record of the project's imported images, layers and layer properties, filters, regions, and associated plug-ins (plug-ins used while creating the project). The user can later load this file to resume working on their project."

Note that for your project to appear correctly in TissUUmaps, you must also possess the images the project uses, and they must be stored in the location(s) specified in your TMAP file.",
