      "A PSV file is a computer-assisted design (CAD) file created by Engineered Software PIPE-FLO Professional, an application used to design liquid piping systems. It contains a read-only model of a piping system. PSV files could previously be opened in PIPE-FLO Viewer, but that application is now discontinued."

      "PIPE-FLO Professional is a fluid system modeling and calculation program that fluid engineers use to design and test prototype piping systems. In the early 2000s, Engineered Software, the company that produces PIPE-FLO Professional, created the PSV file format and PIPE-FLO Viewer application to allow engineers to share project drafts with clients, vendors, and other engineers.",
      "Those who opened a PSV file in PIPE-FLO Viewer could see not just the piping system's design, but also the system's test results and other associated information. They could not, however, edit the piping system, as PSV files were read-only."
