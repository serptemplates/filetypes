      "An S01 file is the second part of a file that was split using ZipSplitter, a program used to split files for easier sharing and storage. It contains a segment of a larger file, such as a .DAT or .AVI file, that is one part of several other parts. S01 files can be restored, along with the other parts (.S00, .S02, etc.) by double-clicking the .EXE file included with the split file."
