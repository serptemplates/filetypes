      "Transitional video format created by various models of the Parrot AR Drone and Gyro Flyer, a radio controlled flying quadcopter helicopter built by the French company Parrot; mp4.infovid files are created because the Parrot iOS recording app records to one format, then converts it to .MP4 as soon as the recording process is stopped."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "If this video conversion is interrupted, either by the user exiting the flight app prior to recording being finished, the drone's battery going flat, or if the drone crash lands, the videos will not have been converted and stay in the original format state.",
      "The manufacturer's tip in such a scenario is to not touch or rename these temporary files, but simply power on the AR.Drone 2., plug in the USB stick and video files will be processed anew shortly."
