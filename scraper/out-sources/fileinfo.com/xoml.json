      "NOTE: Windows Workflow Foundation (WF), the creators of the \".xoml\" file extension, originally used a syntax different than XAML. However, they later adopted the XAML syntax used by the Windows Presentation Foundation (WPF). Therefore, the .XAML extension is often used instead of \".xoml.\" The \".xoml\" extension remains for historical purposes."
