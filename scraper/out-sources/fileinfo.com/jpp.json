      "A JPP file is a page preview file created by Prescape Prinq RIP, a raster image processor (RIP) used in professional printing workflows. It stores a visual preview of a print job page, including the layout, alignment, and content. The Job Page Preview (JPP) format enables users to verify that documents appear as expected before final output, before the job is fully processed and sent to a printer."
