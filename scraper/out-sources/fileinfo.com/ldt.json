      "An LDT file is a luminaire (light fixture) data file created for use with DIALux, a professional lighting planning application. It defines the lighting parameters of a luminaire, including its number of lamps, light intensity, light distribution curve, and size."

      "Each LDT file contains plain text data that defines a luminaire's features. This data is saved in the Elumudat format, which was created by DIAL for use in DIALux. Lighting designers can import LDT files into DIALux to include them in lighting plans for homes, office buildings, neighborhoods, commercial sites, and other environments.",

      "You can open an LDT file in DIAL LDT Editor (Windows) or Meduza Photometric Toolset (Windows) to view the luminaire data it contains in a standardized format. You can also import LDT files into DIAL DIALux Evo (Windows) to simulate a lighting source.",
      "Alternatively, you can open an LDT file in Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, or any other text editor, to view the plain text data it contains. However, it's far better to open an LDT file in LDT Editor or another program that shows the file's data in an understandable format."
