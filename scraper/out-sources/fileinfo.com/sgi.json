      "Silicon Graphics Inc., also known as SGI, was a computer and software company that was founded in 1981 and went bankrupt in 2009. SGI developer Paul Haeberli created the SGI image format in 1995.",
      "Many of the workstations Silicon Graphics produced used the SGI format as their native graphics format. Each SGI image can store 8 to 32 bits per pixel. The format also supports run-length encoding (RLE) compression, which reduces each image's file size.",
