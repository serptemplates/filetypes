      "Developer Kevin Horton created the NSF format to allow NES enthusiasts to save and transfer NES music data in a compact, easy-to-use format. Using various ripping tools, gamers can extract all a game's music and package it in a single NSF file. Each NSF file also contains a small file header, which details various metadata (such as the name of the game from which the file was created).",
      "Often, gamers share NSF files they've created from NES games online, to allow other gamers to download and listen to that music in a media player. However, some chiptune music enthusiasts enjoy creating their own NSF music, using NES music composition programs such as FamiTracker and BleuBleu FamiStudio."
