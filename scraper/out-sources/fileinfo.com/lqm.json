      "You can open LQM files in the QuickMemo app installed on select LG smartphones and tablets. The QuickMemo app is not available for download, so you cannot install it on other phones or devices.",
      "If you receive an LQM file and don't have an LG phone or other software to open the file, you can use a Zip utility, such as 7zip or WinZip, to extract the contents of the file since it is Zip-compressed. Among the contents there is a memoinfo.jlqm file, which contains the text of the note. You may have to rename the file to use the .ZIP extension before you can extract its contents."
