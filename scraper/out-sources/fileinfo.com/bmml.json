      "A BMML file is a mockup file created by Balsamiq Mockups, an application used to build GUI designs and website wireframes. It contains markup language in XML format that is rendered into a mockup of a user interface when opened in Balsamiq Mockups. BMML files were replaced by BMPR files, which are saved in binary format."

      "A mockup consists of various assets, buttons, containers, forms, icons, text, media, and symbols used for designing a user interface or website. Balsamiq Mockups originally stored mockups in .XML files then introduced BMML files in version 2 of the program. BMML files are simply XML files with the \".bmml\" extension. However, BMML files were then replaced by BMPR files with the release of Balsamiq Mockups 3.",
