      "VRCW files are not meant to be manually opened. However, you can extract a VRCW file's assets using Assets Bundle Extractor, uTinyRipper, or DevX-GameRecovery. You can then import those assets into Unity to use them while creating your own VRChat world.",
      "After you've finished editing your VRChat world in Unity, you can upload it to VRChat for use as a VRChat world. To do so, open the VRChat SDK Build Control Panel (VRChat SDK → Show Control Panel → Builder) in Unity. Then select Publish New Build and follow the on-screen instructions to upload your world. (This process will transform your world into a VRCW file.)",
      "To access your VRChat worlds from within VRChat, open the Worlds Menu and select the Mine tab. Your uploaded worlds will appear within the Worlds Menu."
