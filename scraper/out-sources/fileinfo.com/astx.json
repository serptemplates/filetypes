      "An ASTX file is a webpage template written in Elanat's Active Server Template Extended (ASTX) format. It contains server-side webpage code written in the ASPX and/or Razor formats. By importing an ASTX file into an .ASPX file, using Elanat's CodeBehind framework, web developers can quickly add the code their template contains to an ASPX webpage."

      "Elanat is an add-on-oriented extension of Microsoft's .NET framework. It includes CodeBehind, a server-side library that allows web developers to host ASPX webpages on .NET Core servers.",
      "Among other features, CodeBehind allows developers to create and use ASTX files. These files are templates that contain design-oriented webpage elements. Using these templates, developers can quickly integrate design elements into one or more CodeBehind ASPX files. Because CodeBehind supports both ASPX and Razor syntax, ASTX files may include both ASPX- and Razor-formatted elements."
