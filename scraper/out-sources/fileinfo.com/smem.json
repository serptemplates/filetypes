      "Samsung Smart Switch is the official backup app used to transfer a user's messages, contacts, notes, call history, settings, and other data from one Samsung Galaxy to another. Each backup Smart Switch creates is comprised of several encrypted files, each of which contains a portion of the user's data. SMEM files contain a user's Samsung Messages history.",
