      "Unix-like OSes typically contain a user manual divided into eight sections. The final section of this manual describes system-administration commands, daemons, and hardware-related commands. Each page of the manual is saved as a separate 8 file, named for the command it describes.",

      "NOTE: Other sections' Unix man pages use the .1, .2, .3, .4, .5, .6, and .7 extensions. Man pages are also commonly compressed into .GZ files (which may use the .gz.# extension)."
