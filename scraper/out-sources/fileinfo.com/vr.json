      "When you save a project in VR Studio, the application creates a VR file to store the project's contents. VR Studio allows you to crop video, apply edits, add panoramic effects, adjust volume levels, and more. All of these edits are stored in the VR file as text that can be read by the program so when the VR file is opened the project will be the same as when you saved and closed it before."
