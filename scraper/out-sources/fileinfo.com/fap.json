      "A FAP file is an app for a Flipper device, such as the Flipper Zero. Flipper users can load FAP files to run the apps they contain. To load a FAP file, Flipper users place it on their device's SD card and then load it from the device's App Loader application."

      "Flipper Zero is a compact, multi-purpose penetration testing, system exploration, and hacking tool. It contains a plethora of hardware and software that allows it to, for example, act as a remote, analyze signals, read iButton contact keys, and connect to various hardware systems.",
      "Users can extend Flipper Zero's functionality by installing add-on application packages, saved as FAP files. These files are essentially .ELF (Executable and Linkable Format) files that contain additional Flipper-specific resources and metadata. To create FAP files, developers use the Flipper Build Tool (FBT), which is included in Flipper Zero's firmware."
