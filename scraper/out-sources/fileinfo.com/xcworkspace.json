      "An XCWORKSPACE file contains settings configuring the visual workspace in Apple Xcode, an IDE for macOS. It is a macOS package, similar to the .XCODEPROJ file, that stores data files containing workspace settings, such as the View (Navigator, Debug, and Utilities panes) and Editor states. Xcode users typically create XCWORKSPACE files to preserve the layout of a workspace they can load later."

      "Apple Xcode is a free IDE for developers to build software for various Apple platforms, including iOS, macOS, watchOS, and tvOS. The IDE includes many tools for building, testing, deploying, and reviewing user feedback regarding apps.",
      "You can create an XCWORKSPACE file from scratch by selecting File → New → Workspace. You can also create an XCWORKSPACE file from an open project by selecting File → Save As Workspace.... Additionally, when you create an XCODEPROJ file, Xcode automatically creates an XCWORKSPACE file and saves it in the XCODEPROJ file (also a macOS package)."

      "In macOS, you can right-click an XCWORKSPACE file and select Show Package Contents to view the package's directories and files with Apple Finder. Items stored within an XCWORKSPACE file include XCWORKSPACEDATA, .XCUSERSTATE, and .PLIST files and data folders.",
      "NOTE: Modifying the contents in an XCWORKSPACE file may break the workspace configuration."
