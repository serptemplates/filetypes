      "An SNS file is an audio file used by several Electronics Arts video games, including Burnout Paradise and The Sims 3. It stores audio data for game sounds and music that may be encoded with various codecs. Since SNS files store audio encoded with different codecs, converting or playing with standard audio software is difficult; you must use a program that supports the codec used to encode the data, such as FFmpeg or ealayer3."

      "SNS files are rare. You will likely only encounter them if you are attempting to modify the gameplay of a game that uses the file type to store its sound effects and music. For example, a gamer playing Burnout Paradise may navigate the game's resource files (stored in the game installation directory) and modify SNS files to alter the sounds and music played in the game. Additionally, examples of codecs used to encode data in an SNS file include EALayer3 or EA XAS ADPCM.",
