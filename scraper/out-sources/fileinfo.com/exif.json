      "EXIF data is typically contained within the same file as the image data and can often be viewed in image editing programs by selecting \"Get Info\" when viewing the photo. Therefore, most JPEG images that include EXIF data use the standard .JPG extension. However, EXIF data may also be saved to a separate file with an \".exif\" extension."
