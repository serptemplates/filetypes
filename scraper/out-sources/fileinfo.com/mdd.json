      "Model data file used by Point Oven, a commercial suite of plugins used for transferring vertex and fcurve data between modeling programs; saves \"baked\" vertex data for every animation frame of a specified mesh; allows actual vertex mesh positions, or deformations, to be exchanged between other programs that have Point Oven MDD support."

    "content": [
      "Because MDD files store baked vertex data instead of animation curves and motion information, they may be very large in size depending on the size of the original mesh and the amount of animation frames chosen."
