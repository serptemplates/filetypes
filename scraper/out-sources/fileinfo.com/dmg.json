      "You can open a DMG file by double-clicking the file. After clicking the file, the DiskImageMounter utility bundled with macOS verifies the disk image's integrity. After confirming the disk image, the utility mounts the virtual disk and places it on your desktop and in an Apple Finder window as if it was a CD or a USB flash drive inserted into the computer.",
      "You can double-click the program icon (actually an APP file) in the Finder window to run the app. Or, you can drag the program icon to the Applications folder icon in that same window to move it to the Applications directory on your computer, then double-click the app directly from the Applications directory to run it.",
      "You no longer need the DMG file after installing the software stored in the DMG file. Therefore, you can delete the DMG file after installing the software.",
      "DMG files are Mac-specific and not intended for use in Windows. Therefore, if you download a DMG file from a website, check the site for a Windows version of the software (most likely distributed as an .EXE or .MSI file).",
      "Although you cannot install software distributed via DMG files in Windows, several Windows applications can extract their contents, including 7-Zip and PeaZip. You can also attempt to convert the DMG file to an .IMG file with the DMG2IMG utility."
