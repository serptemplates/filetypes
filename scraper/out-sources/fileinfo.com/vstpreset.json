      "Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live, and Image-Line FL Studio all allow audio editors to import VSTPRESET files. Keep in mind, however, that you must also install the plug-in (.VST3 file) a VSTPRESET file is associated with to use the VSTPRESET file.",
      "If your DAW does not support VST 3 and VSTPRESET files, you can convert your VSTPRESET file to an FXB or FXP file in FXTractor (Windows). You can then attempt to load your preset as an FXB or FXP file."
