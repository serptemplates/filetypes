      "A VSTPRESET file is a preset file used by audio-mixing applications that support the Virtual Studio Technology 3 (VST 3) plug-in standard, such as Steinberg Cubase. It contains one or more audio effects that can be loaded in a VST 3 plug-in. VSTPRESET files may also contain descriptive tags, such as Acoustic, Clean, and Percussive, that help users organize and search for presets."

      "Virtual Studio Technology is an audio plug-in interface that allows Digital Audio Workstations (DAWs) to install additional audio effects. While the VST interface was developed by Steinberg, many DAWs, including Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live, and Image-Line FL Studio, use the VST interface to allow users to install plug-ins.",
      "In 2008, Steinberg released the third edition of the VST plug-in standard, named VST 3. VST 3 plug-ins load effects from VSTPRESET files, which contain some combination of new instruments, audio effects, or MIDI effects. Each VSTPRESET file is linked to a specific VST 3 plug-in, such that the file can be loaded only from within that plug-in. VSTPRESET files are stored in the VST3 Presets folder.",
      "NOTE: VSTPRESET files replaced .FXP and .FXB files."

      "Steinberg Cubase, Ableton Live, and Image-Line FL Studio all allow audio editors to import VSTPRESET files. Keep in mind, however, that you must also install the plug-in (.VST3 file) a VSTPRESET file is associated with to use the VSTPRESET file.",
      "If your DAW does not support VST 3 and VSTPRESET files, you can convert your VSTPRESET file to an FXB or FXP file in FXTractor (Windows). You can then attempt to load your preset as an FXB or FXP file."
