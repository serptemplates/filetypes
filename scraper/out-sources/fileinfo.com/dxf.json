      "A DXF file is a data file saved in a format developed by Autodesk and used for CAD (computer-aided design) vector image files, such as AutoCAD documents. DXF files are similar to .DWG files but are more compatible with other programs since they are ASCII (text) based."

      "Autodesk developed the DXF format as a universal format so that more applications could open AutoCAD documents. For example, you can export 3D models as DXF files with the Valve Hammer Editor, then open and edit them with other 3D modeling applications, such as Autodesk AutoCAD or ACD Systems Canvas.",
