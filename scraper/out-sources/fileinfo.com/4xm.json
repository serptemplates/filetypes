      "A 4XM file is a video created using 4X Movie, a middleware video compression program developed by 4X Technologies. It contains a cutscene played in a video game. 4XM files were used in games such as Alone In The Dark: The New Nightmare, Britney's Dance Beat, and The Messenger, among others."

    "content": [
      "4X Technologies was a French software company that was founded in 1997 and produced a variety of middleware applications before closing in 2003. Video game developers such as Infogrames and THQ used 4X's 4X Movie application to compress their games' cutscenes into reasonably-sized video files that did not take up too much disk space. Developers could also include multiple languages' worth of audio tracks within a 4XM file.",
      "In 2002, 4X Technologies founded its own video game development studio, called 4X Studio. Ironically, 4X Studio did not use 4XM files in its own video games."

      "While you can play 4XM videos in VLC media player natively, you may encounter playback issues. To experience smoother playback, you can convert your 4XM file to a more usable video format using FFmpeg before playing it in the media player of your choice."
