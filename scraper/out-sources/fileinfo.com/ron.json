      "A RON file is a plain text file that contains data written using Rusty Object Notation. Rusty Object Notation is a data serialization format that is similar to JSON but uses syntax from the Rust programming language."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "Just like JSON, Rusty Object Notation can be used to structure and transmit data. Unlike JSON files, RON files can include trailing commas and single- and multi-line comments, and they can include struct labels that group sets of data.",
      "Most often, RON files are referenced within Rust programs. To use a RON file with a Rust program, a developer must add Rusty Object Notation as a dependency and then import the RON file."

      "You can open and edit a RON file in any text or source code editor. Source code editors, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code and GitHub Atom, include helpful syntax-highlighting and code-editing tools that make reading and editing RON files easier."
