Plus! for Kids! was designed to be used by children ages 3 to 12, to allow them to install kid-friendly desktop themes and use additional kid-friendly Windows programs.",

Play It! songs were saved as JBX files by default. They could also be exported as .MIDI files, though MIDI files did not save the sound effects children added to their songs."
