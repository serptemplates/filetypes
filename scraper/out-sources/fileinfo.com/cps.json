      "The Powder Toy allows you to play with different substances to simulate the effects of different property interactions. The game comes with a variety of liquids, gases, electronic components, and building materials that you can use to build terrains, explosives, buildings, and more. During gameplay you can choose to save the simulation, which will store the simulation at that point in time, which can be loaded later.",
      "To save a simulation and create a CPS file, click the file and arrow icon in the bottom toolbar, and name the file. To open a simulation stored in a CPS file, click the file and arrow icon on the left side of the bottom toolbar and choose the CPS file you want to open."
