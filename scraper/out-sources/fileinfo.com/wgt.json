      "A WGT file is a data file used by the Integrated Microcomputer Processing System (IMPS), a now-discontinued software tool developed for processing survey and census data. It stores data used in statistical analysis, helping organizations manage and interpret large datasets collected from surveys or censuses. The U.S. Census Bureau primarily and other institutions used the format to conduct population and economic studies."

    "content": [
      "The data stored in WGT files is classified as \"weighted data,\" which is data adjusted to better represent a population or group (commonly used in census analysis, polling, and market research to improve accuracy and reliability). For example, data collectors can assign a weight to correct for biases, such as an underrepresented or overrepresented group, to ensure that the results more accurately reflect the real-world population they are studying.",
      "The U.S. Census Bureau developed IMPS to assist with data entry, editing, tabulation, and analysis, making it a valuable tool for researchers and government agencies. It was widely used in the 1990s and 2000s, but the U.S. Census Bureau discontinued it in favor of the Census and Survey Processing System (CSPro, making the WGT format obscure."
