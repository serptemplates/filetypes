      "An HEVC file contains a video stored in the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) format. This format, also known as H.265, improves over the H.264 standard by allowing videos to be stored with a lower file size but with the same video quality. HEVC helps users store more videos on their devices and also substantially reduces the file size of high-resolution videos such as 4K and 8K videos."

      "NOTE: Most often, HEVC files do not use the file extension \".hevc.\" Instead, devices such as iPhones store HEVC videos in files that use the file extension .MOV. Another file extension commonly used for HEVC video is .MP4."
