      "A DCF file is a media file that has been copy-protected by Sony Ericsson DRM Packager or another Symbian OS DRM app. It contains media, such as a ringtone, song, or video, that can be played only on an authorized smartphone. DCF files are similar to .DM (DRM Delivery Message) files, except their rights object is stored in a separate file."
