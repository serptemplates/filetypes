      "Developer Gary P. Novosielski created LU to help developers more efficiently package and distribute software for the CP/M operating system. Later, LU was also used to package and distribute DOS software. Associated programs, including NULU and LRUN, also allowed users to create and manipulate LBR files.",
      "Like .TAR files, LBR files are not compressed. To reduce LBR files' size, users often compressed them using Squeeze or Crunch compression. These compressed LBR files often use different file extensions. For example, LBR files compressed using Squeeze use the .LQR extension, and LBR files compressed using Crunch use the .LZR extension.",
