      "A KON file contains code in the XML standard for a Yahoo! widget (.WIDGET file), a small program run by the Yahoo! Widget Engine. It stores code that defines the objects that make up the widget, such as buttons and images. Examples of widgets include clocks, calendars, countdown timers, and weather forecasters."
