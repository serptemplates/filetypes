    "description": [
      "An ASC file is an armored ASCII file used by Pretty Good Privacy (PGP), an encryption program utilized for secure communication. It contains a digitally signed message and may store plain-text written information, as well as binary information encoded as text. ASC files also include a key as clear-signed text, which can be verified using PGP authentication methods."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "The ASC file is commonly used for posting online security notices as well as securely transmitting messages via email and text. Since ASC files can contain textual representations of binary information, they may be larger in size than the original pre-encoded file. However, this tradeoff is usually worth the overhead for verifying the source and content of transmitted information.",
      "NOTE: In 2010, Symantec acquired PGP and was integrated into the company's Enterprise Security Group."
