      "A BDM file is a disc information file created by Advanced Video Coding High Definition (AVCHD) video recordings typically captured by high definition consumer camcorders. It contains information about the file contents in a specific directory and is commonly seen as index.bdm or movieobj.bdm. BDM files are located in the AVCHD/​BDMV directory of a media storage device."

      "While .BDMV files are usually seen on optical disc media, BDM files are more commonly seen on non-disc recording media such as hard drives and memory sticks. You can use Roxio Creator, Roxio Toast, CyberLink PowerDVD, and Nero Video to open BDM files.",
      "NOTE: AVCHD was developed by Sony and Panasonic and introduced in 2006."
