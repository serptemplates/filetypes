      "You can upload an H5P file to various content management tools, such as Drupal, WordPress, Moodle, and Ilias, as long as the H5P plugin is installed. You can also view H5P packages on your desktop with the \"h5p-standalone\" program.",
      "Since H5P files are Zip-compressed files, you can also open them with a compression utility, such as Microsoft File Explorer (Windows), Corel WinZip (Windows), RARLAB WinRAR (Windows), or Apple Archive Utility (macOS). You may need to rename the .h5p file extension to .zip in order to open it with the utility. Keep in mind that opening the files this way will not display the content the same way as it would if uploaded via one of the aforementioned web services."
