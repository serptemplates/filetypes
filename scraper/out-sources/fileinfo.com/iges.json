      "You can open IGES files with various CAD programs in Windows, such as Autodesk Fusion 360 (Windows), ideaMK IGSViewer (Windows), and CADSoftTools ABViewer (Windows). You can also open IGES files in macOS with Nemetschek VectorWorks and CADEX CAD Exchanger. Or, you can upload IGES files to ShareCAD.org or CADEX CAD Exchanger Cloud and view them in a web browser.",
      "While you will typically open IGES files with CAD software, you can also open them with a text editor since they are saved in text format. However, the contents will appear as text instead of a visual representation of a part. You can use Microsoft Wordpad (bundled with Windows) or Apple TextEdit (bundled with macOS) to view the plain text in IGES files."
