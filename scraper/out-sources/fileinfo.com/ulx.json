      "IF games were first developed in the 1980s and exploded in popularity. The games are text adventures where the player navigates through the story with word commands instead of moving a character like in current first-person shooter games.",

White pillars march around the perimeter of the room, framing three arches: the Hall of Winds to the west, the Visual Gallery to the east, and the exit to the south. A big brass gong hangs on the wall, next to an ornate calligraphed scroll. >[Type in a verb command here, e.g., Hit the gong]"
