      "An NCA file is a Nintendo Content Archive, which contains game data dumped from a Nintendo Switch game card. It stores multiple files that contain Nintendo content, such as firmware or a Switch game ROM encrypted with AES-XTS encryption. NCA files are similar to CIA files, which are used to store Nintendo 3DS content and WAD files, which are used to store Nintendo Wii content."
