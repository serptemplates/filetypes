      "Fasttracker 2, or Fasttracker II, is a music tracker released in the 1990s for MS-DOS by Fredrik Huss and Magnus Högdahl (of Triton Productions), but it is no longer developed. The software allows you to create music by arranging patterns of samples in tracks.",
      "When saving a composition with Fasttracker 2, the program creates an XM file to store the music. While Fasttracker 2 was discontinued in the 1990s, people may still export modules to the XM format with other applications."
