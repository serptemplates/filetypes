      "An F3D file is a 3D product design created in Autodesk Fusion 360, a cloud-based product design program. It contains a prototype of a tool, machine, part, or other meant-to-be-manufactured items. Fusion 360 users create F3D files when manually exporting a product design."

      "Autodesk Fusion 360 is a 3D industrial and mechanical design application that engineers use to design and test products. For example, an engineer might prototype a car with Fusion 360 before submitting the car to simulated motion, stress, and thermal tests.",
      "Typically, you will share Fusion 360 designs with others via the app's cloud platform. However, you can also manually export a design by selecting File → Export... in the Fusion 360 menu bar (or exporting the file from Fusion 360's cloud platform). When you do, the design is saved locally as an F3D file. You can save and share your F3D files with others to provide access to designs in cases where cloud access is not available."
