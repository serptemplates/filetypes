      "An AEPX file is a video project created by Adobe After Effects, an application for creating special effects. It contains references to video assets and project settings in the XML standard, including compositions, effects, keyframes, and layer configurations, but does not embed media files directly (it points to their locations). AEPX files are an alternative project format to the standard .AEP binary format."

      "After Effects saves projects in the AEP format by default, which loads faster and takes up less space than AEPX files. However, the AEPX format can be useful in special cases. For example, AEPX files are helpful for automation workflows, manual editing, or saving a readable project backup (you can open and modify them with a text or XML editor).",
      "To save an AEPX file, go to File → Save As → Save a Copy As XML... in After Effects. After saving, you can reopen and continue editing the project just like with a standard AEP file."
