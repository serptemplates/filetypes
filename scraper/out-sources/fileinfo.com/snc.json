      "Sonic Adventure DX is a remastered version of the original Sonic Adventure. It was released in 2004 and is available for GameCube and Windows. In this 3D platforming game, Sonic and friends must collect the Chaos Emeralds before Dr. Robotnik can use them to unleash Perfect Chaos.",
      "The Windows version of Sonic Adventure DX saves players' game data in SNC files. For example, SonicDX01.snc (and other SNC files whose filename ends in a number) contains a player's story progress. Other SNC files, such as SONICADVENTURE_DX_CHAOGARDEN.snc contain a record of a player's minigame progress or other achievements.",
      "Sonic Adventure DX was itself re-released in 2011. This version of Sonic Adventure DX uses SNC files that are formatted slightly differently and have names like SonicAdventure01.snc and SonicAdventureChaoGarden.snc."
