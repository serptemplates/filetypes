      "A MEM file is a data file used by Microsoft Visual FoxPro (originally FoxPro), a discontinued relational database management system (RDBMS) used to build desktop database applications. It stores information about memory variables and arrays created during a Visual FoxPro session. Developers often save these variables in a MEM file to preserve the current state of a project or to share values between sessions."

    "content": [
      "MEM files are helpful for backing up temporary data and reusing sets of predefined variables (users can export memory variables to a MEM file using the SAVE TO command). Because of this, developers often used MEM files in development workflows, testing routines, and configuration management within Visual FoxPro applications.",
