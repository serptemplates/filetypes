To open a SCHEMATIC file in MCEdit, select the Import button while editing a level. You can also export a structure as a SCHEMATIC file by selecting Export Schematic after selecting the structure.",
      "At the moment, there is no easy way to convert a Minecraft SCHEMATIC file to a SCHEM file. You can, however, convert SCHEM files to SCHEMATIC files, so the structures they contain can be used in pre-1.13 versions of Minecraft, using SchemToSchematic (Web) or Mineways (Windows)."
