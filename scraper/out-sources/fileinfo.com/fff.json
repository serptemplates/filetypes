      "An FFF file is a camera raw image created by various Hasselblad digital camera models, including H6D-400C MS and X1D II 50C. It stores uncompressed image data exactly how it was captured by the CCD, which allows for higher resolution images than compressed image data. Professional photographers typically use FFF files because they store higher-quality images they can more accurately edit."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "Since FFF files store uncompressed image data, the files can become very large, typically in the 100s of MBs range. Therefore, if you want to share an image captured as an FFF file, you should convert it to a more widely supported format, such as .JPEG, .PNG, or .TIFF. Converting the FFF image to one of these formats compresses the image data, making it easier to share it online.",
      "NOTE: Hasselblad cameras may also capture images as .3FR files."

Some other image editors that support FFF files are Microsoft Photos (bundled with Windows), Apple Preview, Corel PaintShop Pro (Mac) and Adobe Photoshop (Windows and Mac)."
