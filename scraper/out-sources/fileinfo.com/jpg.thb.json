      "A JPG.THB file is a thumbnail image created by a Cuddeback trail camera. It stores a small, low-resolution preview of a full-size .JPG photo saved in the camera's memory, and is usually named with the same base filename (for example, Cdy00002.JPG and Cdy00002.JPG.THB). Cuddeback cameras generate JPG.THB thumbnails so users can quickly view or browse photos on the camera's built-in screen or with Cuddeback's viewing software."

      "Hunters and wildlife photographers who use Cuddeback trail cameras to monitor activity in outdoor areas are most likely to encounter JPG.THB files. They likely will find them when transferring images from the camera's SD card. JPG.THB files contain compressed image data similar to a standard JPEG image, but they are formatted for internal use by the camera."
