      "An LRF file is a game replay created by LOLReplay, a game replay recorder and manager for League of Legends (LoL). It is used for re-watching gameplay and sharing the replay with others online. LRF files can be opened only by LOLReplay, but still require that League of Legends be installed on the computer."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "LRF files are not video files and cannot be opened by video playback programs. Instead, they can only be played with the LOLReplay software. This is because LRF files capture events that take place during gameplay, and the software re-simulates the events when it is replayed. This allows the file sizes to stay small in comparison to a full-motion video equivalent. It also allows the observer to move over the map, select units, and view the replay from multiple perspectives.",
