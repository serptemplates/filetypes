      "Clicker allows young children to write by selecting words, phrases, and/or pictures to create sentences and stories. (Advanced users can also write using an in-app keyboard.) These words, phrases, and pictures are organized in grid sets, which display items in grids of various sizes.",
      "To create a grid set, Clicker users (or more likely, teachers or parents) select File → New Grid Set. Clicker then shows the New Grid Set window, from which the user can select a grid set template.",
      "Each grid set template, or CLKT file, is optimized for creating different types of grid sets. For example, CLKT files stored in the Phrases directory are ideal for creating grids that contain phrases, while CLKT files stored in the Picture Banks directory are ideal for creating grids that contain images."
