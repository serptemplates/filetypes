      "An OAM file is an animated widget saved in the Adobe Edge Animate Widget file format. It was likely created by Adobe Edge Animate, a program that uses HTML5, CSS, and JavaScript technologies to create animated web content. OAM files are used to insert widgets into InDesign documents (.INDD), Dreamweaver website projects, and other content created with Adobe Creative Suite applications. They may also be referred to as Adobe Edge Animate Deployment Packages."

      "Each OAM file contains shapes, images, and other content, as well as a timeline for playing the animation the file contains. Users can create OAM files by publishing from an Edge Animate project (.AN file). Users can also export OAM files from Adobe Animate, Adobe Flash, and other animation applications.",
