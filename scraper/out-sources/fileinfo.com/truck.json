      "You can open a TRUCK file, view its contents, and edit its contents in any text or source code editor, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code (cross-platform) or GitHub Atom (cross-platform).",
      "You can also open a TRUCK file in some 3D modeling applications, such as Blender with the Rigs of Rods N/B Import/Export plug-in installed (cross-platform). This allows you to view and edit the TRUCK file's nodes and beams visually, instead of as text.",
      "Finally, you can import a TRUCK file into Rigs of Rods (Windows, Linux) for use as a Rigs of Rods vehicle. Typically, finished TRUCK files are packed within .ZIP archives, which Rigs of Rods users place in the game's mods directory. Users can then select the vehicles the ZIP file contains from within Rigs of Rods."
