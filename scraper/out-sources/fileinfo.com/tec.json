      "A TEC file is a file created by TECkit (Text Encoding Conversion toolkit), a program used for conducting text conversions. It contains binary code that describes the mapping between a byte encoding and Unicode and vice versa. TEC files are sometimes used in conjunction with LaTeX technologies to convert characters on the fly when generating LaTeX documents in different languages."
