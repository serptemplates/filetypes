      "An ERG file contains information about a cycling workout that is used by various cycling training programs, such as RacerMate CompuTrainer, Rouvy, and Trainer Road. It stores information about a power cycling workout, such as the duration, distance, average speed, calories burned, description, and post-activity comments. ERG files can only store power cycling data, whereas heart rate and pace cycling data are typically stored in .FIT files."
