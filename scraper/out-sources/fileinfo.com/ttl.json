      "AGT games can be packaged with a wide variety of files that contain game data, including DA1, .INS, and .VOC files. Because of the large number of files that accompany the AGT game, the files can be converted into a single .AGX file with the AGT2AGX utility that comes with AGiliTy. This conversion reduces clutter, decreases load time, and reduces game size over 100K."
