      "VC3 files are saved in a compressed format that may use up to a 20:1 compression ratio. This type of compression is often used for samples transferred over the internet. VC3 files may also be saved in a lossless format that uses a compression ratio of about 2:1. The lossless compression is often used for sound archival purposes."
