    "description": [
      "An OYX file is an alternate index file used by Lotus Approach, a desktop database application developed by Lotus Software. It serves as a backup to the main index file (.ADX file) and allows the program to continue accessing database records if the primary index becomes damaged or unreadable. OYX files are typically created automatically by Lotus Approach and are stored alongside the database."

      "Approach Software Corporation initially developed Lotus Approach, a relational database management system (RDBMS) that Lotus Development Corporation acquired in 1994. Lotus included the software in Lotus SmartSuite, a productivity suite that also featured Lotus 1-2-3 (spreadsheet), Word Pro (word processor), and Freelance Graphics (presentation software). IBM later acquired Lotus Approach and eventually discontinued the software, making the OYX file obscure."

      "OYX files are not meant to be opened manually. Instead, Lotus Approach automatically manages the files in the background. However, users or support technicians might delete or restore OYX files to recover data in troubleshooting scenarios, such as when a database fails to load."
