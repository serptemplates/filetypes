      "A MAM file is a shortcut that links to a macro for Microsoft Access, a database management system. It is a plain text file containing the shortcut's properties, such as the database it is connected to, the object type, the shortcut version, and the creation time. Access users can double-click MAM files to run macros, or they can open and edit them with a text editor."
