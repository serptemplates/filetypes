      "Vuforia includes a text recognition engine that uses the UTF-8 character encoding standard to recognize words. A VWL file comes default with the Vuforia SDK but it may be replaced or modified by a user. The default VWL file typically stores approximately 100,000 of the most used words but a user can create custom VWL files that store up to 10,000 words.",
