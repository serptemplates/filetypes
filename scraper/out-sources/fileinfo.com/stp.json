    "description": [
      "An STP file is a 3D assembly file supported by various mechanical design programs, such as IMSI TurboCAD and Autodesk Fusion 360. It contains three-dimensional object data saved in the Standard for the Exchange of Product Data (STEP) format. STP files are saved in a text-based ASCII format that conforms to the STEP Application Protocols ISO 10303-2xx."

    "content": [
      "The STEP file format is a standardized 3D model format that engineers can use to save and transfer 3D models between different computer-aided design (CAD) and computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) programs. Before the STEP format's existence, users of one program often could not open models created in another program, making it difficult to share 3D models among users.",
      "Most STEP files are saved with the .stp file extension. However, you may also encounter STEP models saved with the .step extension (.STEP files). The files contain plain text data that a CAD or CAM program references to load a 3D model. For example, many STP files contain data used to show a model of a manufactured mold or part."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open an STP file with various CAD applications, including Autodesk Fusion 360 (cross-platform, FreeCAD (cross-platform), IMSI TurboCAD (Windows, Mac), and Dassault Systemes CATIA (Windows, Linux).",
      "For example, to open an STP file in Autodesk Fusion 360:",
      "Select File → Open... from the program's menu bar",
      "When the Open window appears, select Open from my computer...",
      "Navigate to and open your STP file",
      "Since STP files are saved in plain text, you can open an STP file with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit, or a source code editor. When opened in a text or source code editor, you can view the STEP model data and metadata.",
      "You can also modify the properties of an STP file with a text or source code editor. However, if you incorrectly change the file properties, you may inadvertently corrupt the file."
