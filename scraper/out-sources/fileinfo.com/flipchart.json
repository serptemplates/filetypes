      "A FLIPCHART file is a presentation created with ActivInspire, an educational lesson-planning application. It contains elements of a lesson plan such as arithmetic principles and problem-solving exercises. FLIPCHART files store various types of lessons including sentence puzzles, math lessons, multi-digit addition word problems, and Jeopardy game templates."

      "FLIPCHART files are typically used by teachers for storing interactive presentations for students. Educators use the ActivInspire program to create the lessons then present them with interactive, electronic whiteboard hardware like ActivBoard Touch which features multitouch capabilities and a dry-erase surface.",
      "If you do not have presentation hardware for presenting FLIPCHART files, ActivInspire allows you to export your FLIPCHART files to a more popular format, such as .PPT, .DOC, .PDF, .HTML, or .SWF. To do this select Flipchart → Export and then select to which format you would like to export the FLIPCHART file.",
      "NOTE: Flipcharts may also be saved with the .FLP extension, which ActivInspire supports as well."
