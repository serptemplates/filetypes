      "To open an MCWORLD file in Minecraft Bedrock or Education Edition, double-click (or otherwise open) the file. Minecraft will then automatically import the world your MCWORLD file contains. If this doesn't work, you can try manually importing the world by moving the MCWORLD file to the ~/​game/​com.mojang/​minecraftWorlds directory and decompressing it.",
      "You can also view an MCWORLD file's contents using any Zip-decompression utility, such as 7-Zip (Windows), Apple Archive Utility (Mac), or B1 Free Archiver (multiplatform). You may have to rename the file's extension to .zip before you can decompress it."
