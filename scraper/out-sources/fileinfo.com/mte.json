      "An MTE file is used by the discontinued MadTracker 2, a music tracker for Windows. It stores audio envelope data referenced by the software to modify the shape of a waveform over time, affecting aspects like volume, pitch, or filtering. MTE envelopes allowed users to create dynamic changes in their sounds, making them helpful to music producers and sound designers for shaping audio within MadTracker 2 projects."

    "content": [
      "An audio envelope is a way to shape the characteristics of a sound over time by controlling how a sound starts, develops, and fades through modifying parameters, such as volume, pitch, or filter frequency. In relation to MadTracker 2, MTE files help shape sound dynamics, making them useful for genres like chiptune, electronic music, and demoscene compositions.",
      "Yannick Delwiche developed MadTracker 2, and it became a popular tracker-based DAW in the early 2000s. However, modern alternatives, such as Renoise and OpenMPT, have largely replaced it. Since MadTracker 2 is no longer actively developed, MTE files are obscure. Tracker enthusiasts who continue working with the software or revisiting older projects are likely the only users encountering MTE files."
