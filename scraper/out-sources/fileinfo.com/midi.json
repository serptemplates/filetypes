      "A MIDI file contains electronic music data saved in the Musical Instrument Digital Interface (MIDI) format. The MIDI format defines notes that are played, when they are played, how long they are held, and their velocities (how hard they are pressed).

      "MIDI is a widely-used connectivity standard that allows computers, hardware, and digital music programs to communicate musical information with each other. MIDI files contain information that defines a song or other piece of audio's contents. The information MIDI files contain is not actual audio. Instead, it is akin to sheet music, which can be read and played by MIDI-compliant programs and devices.",
