      "Temporary file created by Live Mesh, a Microsoft application used for synchronizing files between computers, Windows Live SkyDrives, and other storage locations; marks a file that still has to be downloaded from a remote storage location to the local storage location; acts as a placeholder until the actual file is downloaded."

      "WLX filenames are created by appending the \".wlx\" suffix to the files that need to be synchronized. For example, if myimage.png needs to be synchronized from a remote location, Live Mesh creates a temporary file named myimage.png.wlx in the local directory. When synchronization is complete (when the file is downloaded), Live Mesh removes the WLX file.",
