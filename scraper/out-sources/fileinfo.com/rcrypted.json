      "Since RCRYPTED files are encrypted and cannot be decrypted, you cannot open them. Typically, the best option for restoring ransomware-encrypted files to their previous state is to perform a System Restore. However, Ryuk often disables this option, which will not allow you to restore your system to a previous state. At this time, there is no solution for removing the Ryuk ransomware and restoring files encrypted as RCRYPTED files."
