      "An IPYNB file is a notebook document created by Jupyter Notebook, an interactive computational environment that helps scientists manipulate and analyze data using Python. It contains all the content from a Jupyter Notebook web application session, including computation inputs and outputs, mathematical functions, images, and explanatory text. IPYNB files can be exported to the .HTML, .PDF, reStructuredText, and LaTeX formats."

      "IPYNB notebooks are plain text files formatted using JSON, making them human-readable and easy to share with others. Oftentimes, scientists will host their IPYNB files online at publicly-accessible URLs. This allows other Jupyter Notebook users to either:",
      "Download the files and open them in their own instance of Jupyter Notebook",
      "Paste the files' URLs into the online Jupyter Notebook Viewer, to view the notebook on the web without installing any software",
      "NOTE: Jupyter notebooks were formerly known as IPython notebooks, which is why they use the .ipynb extension (IPython notebook). While the IPYNB file format was originally created for use with IPython, it is now used primarily by Jupyter Notebook, which incorporates IPython."
