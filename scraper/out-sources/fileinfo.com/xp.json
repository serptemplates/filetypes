      "An XP file is a song pattern created by Triton Fasttracker 2, an audio tracker for MS-DOS. It stores a pattern, which consists of multiple rows (64 by default and 1,024 maximum) divided into columns configuring aspects of the note (instrument used, volume setting, effects, etc.). Fasttracker 2 users can arrange patterns in XP files with other patterns to create a complete song, or .XM module."
