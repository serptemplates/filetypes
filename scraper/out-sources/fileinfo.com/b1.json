      "B1 Free Archiver is a simple utility that allows users to create and expand compressed archives. By default, the archives B1 Free Archiver creates are saved as B1 files. B1 files are compressed using LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain Algorithm) compression, and they may be password-protected.",
      "NOTE: B1 files may be part of a split archive, in which case they use the .part####.b1 extension. To extract the files a split archive contains, you must possess all pieces of the archive. For example, to extract the files contained in a two-part B1 archive, you must possess both filename.part0001.b1 and filename.part0002.b1."
