      "Impulse Tracker is a free music tracker developed by Jeffrey Lim that was released in 1995 and is no longer developed. The music sequencing program allows you to create music by organizing notes in different channels as patterns that play samples stored in instruments (.ITI files).",
      "In Impulse Tracker, you can save your modules as IT files, which you can share with other audio-tracker users who can import them into software that supports the module format. IT files are similar to ScreamTracker 3 modules (.S3M files) but support more data per pattern and higher-quality samples."
