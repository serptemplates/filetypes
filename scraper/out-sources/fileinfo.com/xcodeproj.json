      "An XCODEPROJ file is a software development project created with Apple Xcode, an IDE for macOS. It is a macOS package that stores all of the information for the project, including references to source files (such as source code, resources, and image files) and project configuration data (such as debug and release build settings). Xcode users save the software they are developing for macOS, iOS, watchOS, or tvOS as XCODEPROJ files to preserve their progress, then compile their software projects into executable apps for distribution."

      "As you develop your software with Xcode, you can save it as an XCODEPROJ file, which allows you to close it and re-open it for further editing. To create an XCODEPROJ file with Xcode, select File → New → Project. Then, when you finish developing your software, you can choose Product → Build to compile the source code and build an executable .APP file."
