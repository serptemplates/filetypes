      "IncrediBots 2 does not save IB2 files directly. Instead, when saving a challenge, the game provides a plain text string that can be copied into a text file and later loaded back into the game. While the .TXT extension could be used, a recommended file extension for these save files is \".ib2,\" which stands for IncrediBots 2."
