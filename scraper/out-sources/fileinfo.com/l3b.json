      "An L3B file is a 3D LEGO file created by SR 3D Builder, a program used to build digital 3D LEGO models. It contains the dimensions of a 3D LEGO model which include their placements within a 3D coordinate system. L3B files can be used to store a variety of LEGO models such as dune buggies, trucks, and front end loaders."
