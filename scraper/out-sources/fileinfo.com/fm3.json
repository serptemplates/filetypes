      "An FM3 file is a project created by the TAS Editor tool included with version 2.2.0 or later of FCEUX, an open-source Nintendo Entertainment System and Family Computer Disk System emulator. It contains information about a tool-assisted speedrun (TAS), which includes records of buttons pushed during gameplay in plain text and binary format, metadata, and TAS Editor-specific data."

      "FCEUX is an advanced version of the FCE Ultra emulator and is primarily used by gamers who want to play old, discontinued games on their computer. The emulator is designed to provide functions from different FCE Ultra branches, such as FCEU rerecording, FCEUXD, and FCEUXDSP.",
      "FM3 files are similar to .FM2 files saved in the FCEUX Movie Capture Format (FM2). However, FM3 files are saved in the FCEUX TAS Editor Movie Capture format, which is the same as FM3 but also includes information specific to TAS Editor.",
      "FM2 files save records of buttons pushed during gameplay to allow a user to play it and recreate their gameplay. The FM2 format was the only movie capture format used by FCEUX to store gameplay until version 2.2.0 (released in November 2012), which is when the TAS Editor was introduced. The editor allowed users to create and modify their speedruns, which are attempts to finish a game as quickly as possible. With the TAS Editor users can optimize their speedrun by altering the buttons that were pushed in order to improve their reaction time to enemies and barriers to ultimately decrease their time.",
      "The FM3 format consists of a header and input log, which is the same as the FM2 format. The header stores information in key-value ASCII plain text format, such as the version of the movie format, version of the emulator that produced the file, and the size of the movie (number of frames). The input log consists of movie records in text or binary format that include the position of the mouse and buttons pushed.",
      "FM3 also includes \"Taseditor\" data, which is what sets it apart from the FM2 format. This section is stored after the input log data in the FM3 file and includes information about various aspects of the TAS Editor, such as bookmarks and selection history.",

    "instructions": [
      "You can open an FM3 file with FCEUX 2.2.0 or later by following these steps:",
      "Load the game ROM you are going to emulate in FCEUX by selecting File → Open ROM",
      "Open the TAS Editor by selecting Tools → TAS Editor",
      "Select File → Open",
      "Navigate to the FM3 file and select it",
      "Since FM3 files are also partially saved in plain text, you can also open and modify the files with a text editor. Keep in mind that you will only be able to modify parts of the data and that it may cause the file to become corrupt."
