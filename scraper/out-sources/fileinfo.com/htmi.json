      "An HTMI file is a text file saved in the HyperText Media Interoperable (HTMI) format. It contains text written in a format based on HTML. HTMI files are most often used to encode binary files, such as images, movies, or electronic publications, in a human-readable and -editable format and embed those files in HTML files."

    "content": [
      "Developers can use the HTMI format to encode and embed binary files within an HTML document that is meant to be viewed in a web browser. Then, when a user opens the HTMI file in their web browser, the browser will automatically read the binary file without the aid of any additional programs.",
      "HTMI is an interoperable format that can be embedded in any other text MIME type format. HTMI content is most often embedded or referenced externally within HTML and server languages, and it is usually used to add DRM to media files.",
