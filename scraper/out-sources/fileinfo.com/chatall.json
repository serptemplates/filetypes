      "A CHATALL file is a backup file containing settings and chats from ChatALL, an app allowing users to converse concurrently with multiple Large Language Model (LLM) AI bots. It is a Zip-compressed archive that stores multiple .JSON files (ChatALL.json and localforage.json) containing plain text information about settings and chats in the JSON standard. ChatALL users export and import CHATALL files to share or preserve settings and messages."

You may need to rename the .chatall file extension to .zip for the Zip utility to recognize and decompress it."
