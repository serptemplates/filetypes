      "An IROS file is a properties file used by Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator. It contains settings for the programs' Save for Web tool, including image format (JPEG, PNG-8, PNG-24, GIF, or WBMP), quality, and size settings. When a user selects Save for Web in either program, the program uses an IROS file to load default, web-optimized image settings. Save for Web settings files are more often saved as .IRS files."
