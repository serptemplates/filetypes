      "Axure RP projects can be interactive, allowing dynamic links and form fields. Therefore, prototypes can provide closer functionality to the actual product before implementation. Projects can also be annotated during the design process.",
      "Axure RP can export projects to HTML webpages that can be viewed through any Web browser. They can also be exported to Microsoft Word documents. This helps with collaboration between different working groups.",
      "NOTE: RP project files differ from .RPPRJ shared projects, since shared projects are created on a network volume or within a Subversion version control system."
