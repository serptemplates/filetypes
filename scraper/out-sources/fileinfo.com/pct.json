      "Apple created the PICT format for use with QuickDraw, a 2D graphics library and API used by previous versions of Mac OS. Two versions of the PICT format, PICT 1 and PICT 2, exist. PICT 1 supports up to eight colors. PICT 2 supports 24- and 32-bit color (up to millions of colors).",
      "While the PICT format is a vector format, PICT files can contain embedded raster images. Many PICT files contain only a single embedded raster image and do not contain any vector data.",
      "NOTE: PICT images that use the .pct extension were likely created on a Windows computer. PICT images created on Macs typically use the .PICT extension."
