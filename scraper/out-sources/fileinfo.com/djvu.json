      "DJVU (pronounced \"deja vu\") files are very similar to .PDF files. Using DJVU creators, users can scan high-resolution color pages of books, magazines, comics, catalogs, and other documents and publish them on the web. Many DJVU files contain ebooks, archived and published by book digitization projects.",
      "AT&T Labs published the initial version of the DJVU format in 1998. The format was most recently revised in 2005. Before Adobe standardized the PDF format in 2008, DJVU was considered the superior document format. Notably, DJVU is open source, and it can compress documents to smaller sizes than .JPEG, .GIF, and .TIFF compression."
