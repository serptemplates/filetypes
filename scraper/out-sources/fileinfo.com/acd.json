      "An ACD file is a project created by MAGIX ACID, a digital audio workstation (DAW) used for music creation and audio production. It stores the structure of an audio project, including multiple audio tracks and references to sound loops, recordings, and other media files used in the composition. ACD files also contain project settings, such as applied effects, volume levels, panning positions, and playback timing information."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "Musicians, producers, and audio engineers use ACD files when creating, editing, and arranging music with ACID. After modifying their project, users share the finished music with others, typically by exporting it as an .MP3 or .WAV file.",
      "NOTE: ACD files store references to external media on the computer, they do not store actual audio data. Because ACD files rely on external media, moving or deleting those linked files can cause missing audio in the project."

      "You can open ACD files with MAGIX ACID or related versions of the software, such as the older Sony ACID Pro. To open an ACD file with ACID, select File → Open."
