      "An FTL file is a template used by FreeMarker, a Java template engine used to auto-generate text output. It contains source text as well as FreeMarker variable definitions and instructions that are used as placeholders for text substitutions. FTL files are commonly used for auto-generating HTML webpages, .JAVA class skeleton files, and other source code files, such as .PHP, .ASP, and .CFM files."

      "To generate a new text file, developers input two files into FreeMarker: an FTL template file and a JAVA file that loads data used for substitutions.",
      "NOTE: FreeMarker is distributed as an open-source Java package that can be embedded into Java software products. One popular Java-based product that uses FTL files is Alfresco, an Enterprise Content Management (ECM) system."
