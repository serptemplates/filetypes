      "Typically, DOWNLOADING files are not meant to be opened. If you possess a DOWNLOADING file, you should resume the associated download in Pando. After the download finishes, Pando will assign the file its correct extension, and you can open it normally.",
      "If your Pando download was interrupted and you cannot resume it, you may still be able to view your DOWNLOADING file's contents. To do so, replace the .downloading extension with the extension your file is supposed to have. For example, if you were downloading an MP4 file, change your DOWNLOADING file's extension to .mp4. You can then attempt to open the partially-downloaded version of your file."
