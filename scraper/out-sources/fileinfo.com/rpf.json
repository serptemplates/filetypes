      "An RPF file is a game data archive used by various Rockstar Games titles such as Grand Theft Auto V and Red Dead Redemption 2. It stores game assets, such as 3D character models, textures, audio, and scripts in the RAGE Package Format (RPF), named after the Rockstar Advanced Game Engine (RAGE) that powers many Rockstar games. RPF files bundle multiple assets into a single, compressed file, helping the game load and manage content efficiently."

    "content": [
      "While casual players don't typically interact with RPF files, game modders looking to customize or enhance gameplay often access them. For example, a modder might extract and edit a texture stored in an RPF file to change a character's appearance, or they might replace in-game audio with custom sounds.",
      "NOTE: Altering RPF files can impact game performance or violate terms of service, especially in online environments."

    "instructions": [
      "RPF files are not meant to be opened. Instead, the game that the files are packaged with automatically references them to load their information.",
      "However, if you are looking to modify the content the RPF files store, you can open RPF files with various tools, such as Spark IV and OpenIV (Windows). These tools allow you to view, edit, and extract content from RPF files and add assets to them."
