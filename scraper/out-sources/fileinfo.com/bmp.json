      "Microsoft developed the BMP format, also known as the Device Independent Bitmap (DIB) format, to save images that appear consistent across different devices. The BMP format begins with a file header, including the bitmap identifier, file size, width, height, data compression method (optional), color options, and bitmap data starting point. After the header, the format stores raw pixel image data and optional ICC Color Profile data.",
      "NOTE: Since BMP files are uncompressed, they may be large. Therefore, the JPEG and PNG image formats are common alternatives to the BMP format for saving and transferring digital images."
