      "Audio sample definition file saved in the SFZ format and used to define instruments; contains opcodes that define audio sample attributes, such as their map location across a standard MIDI keyboard and how notes will respond to velocity; also includes the default path used to locate the collection of samples, most likely .WAV, .AIFF, .MP3, .OGG, or .FLAC files."

      "Opcodes that are contained in the SFZ file are used for a variety of purposes. They are used to define common values that are applied to regions within a group, define keyboard zones, specify a pitch offset for a group or region, and more.",
      "Since the SFZ files are standard and contain opcodes in plain text, you can create a SFZ file from scratch by using a basic text editor, such as Notepad (for Windows) or TextEdit (for OS X)."
