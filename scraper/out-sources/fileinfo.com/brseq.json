      "A BRSEQ file contains data in the Binary Revolution SEQuence (BRSEQ) format, which is used by various Nintendo Wii games. It stores audio data played by the game as a sound effect or background music that is looped during gameplay. BRSEQ files are typically packaged in .BRSAR audio archives included with the Wii game."

      "BRSEQ files are not meant to be opened by Wii gamers. They are packaged with Wii games that are referenced by the game when played on a Wii console.",
      "However, some gamers enjoy modifying gameplay and extract BRSEQ files from BRSAR archives in order to alter them. You can convert BRSEQ files to the .MID file format using the rseq2midi tool in Windows.",
      "NOTE: BRSEQ files are typically only found in BRSAR archives packaged with the Mario Kart Wii game."
