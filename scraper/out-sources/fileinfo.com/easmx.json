      "An EASMX file is a CAD drawing created by Dassault Systemes eDrawings Publisher, a plug-in used to export designs from CAD applications. It is saved in the .XPS file format, which allows anyone with an XPS viewer to open it. EASMX files are used to share drawings over the Internet and print drawings from computers that do not have CAD software installed."

      "eDrawings Publisher is a plug-in available for many CAD applications, including Dassault Systemes SolidWorks, Autodesk AutoCAD, Dassault Systemes CATIA, Autodesk Inventor, Trimble SketchUp, and more. Publisher allows CAD users to export their 2D and 3D models in compressed and easy-to-open formats, so they can share the models over the Internet and with users who do not have access to CAD software.",
      "EASMX is one of the formats in which users can choose to export their 3D models. EASMX files are, essentially, XPS (XML Paper Specification) files. The XPS format is Microsoft's version of the .PDF format. All Windows users can open XPS files in Microsoft XPS Viewer, and other users can open XPS files in other XPS viewers. So, all users should be able to open and view a model saved in an EASMX file, regardless of whether they have access to a CAD application.",
      "However, it is best to view EASMX files in Dassault Systemes' free eDrawings Viewer. eDrawings Viewer provides additional viewing tools that allow users to switch between drawing views and examine models more closely. It also allows users to export drawings in other file formats, including the .STL format and various image file formats."

      "You can open EASMX files in eDrawings Viewer (cross-platform), any CAD application that has the eDrawings Publisher plug-in installed, or any XPS viewer, such as Microsoft XPS Viewer (Windows). Each of these applications may show the model your EASMX file contains slightly differently."
