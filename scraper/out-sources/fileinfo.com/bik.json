      "BIK files are not meant to be opened. Instead, the game packaged with the BIK file references the video to play it. You will most likely encounter BIK files only as part of installed game data.",
      "However, you can open BIK files with various utilities, including RAD Video Tools, the official player released by RAD Game Tools. VideoLAN VLC media player can open BIK files and older sysytems with Windows Media Player may also play BIK files if the proper codec is installed."
