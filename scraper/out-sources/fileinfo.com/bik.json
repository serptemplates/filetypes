      "A BIK file is a video file saved in the proprietary Bink Video format, a format developed by RAD Game Tools that is widely used in PC and console video games. It contains a cutscene, intro, or in-game movie. The Bink Video format compresses standard video files to reduce their size while preserving quality tailored to the target platform."

    "content": [
      "Game developers often convert videos from common formats like .AVI or .MOV into the Bink format using RAD’s compression tools. The format allows developers to adjust data rates for a wide range of resolutions, from 320x240 for handheld devices to high-definition resolutions for modern PCs and consoles. This flexibility made Bink one of the most common video formats in the gaming industry during the 2000s and 2010s.",
      "Examples of games that support BIK files include:",
      "Left 4 Dead and Left 4 Dead 2",
      "Portal and Portal 2",
      "Hitman: Blood Money",
      "Fallout: New Vegas",

      "BIK files are not meant to be opened. Instead, the game packaged with the BIK file references the video to play it. You will most likely encounter BIK files only as part of installed game data.",
      "However, you can open BIK files with various utilities, including RAD Video Tools, the official player released by RAD Game Tools. VideoLAN VLC media player can open BIK files and older sysytems with Windows Media Player may also play BIK files if the proper codec is installed."
