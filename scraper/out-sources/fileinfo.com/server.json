      "A SERVER file contains a script used by MySQL to automate one or more processes. It stores instructions for performing various functions, such as starting, stopping, or restarting the MySQL daemon, managing multiple MySQL servers, and retrieving a status report for one or more servers. SERVER files are saved in a plain text format."

      "A common SERVER file is mysql.server, which is a script included with MySQL distributions on Unix and Unix-like systems. The mysql.server script can be found in the the same directory where MySQL is installed, which is /​usr/​share/​mysql/​ on a Unix system or /​etc/​init.d in macOS. The mysql.server script is used to start and stop a MySQL server.",
      "Another common SERVER file is mysqld_multi.server, which is typically located in /​etc/​init.d in macOS. The script can be used to start, stop, or obtain a status report from one or more MySQL servers.",
