      "An NFW file is a configuration file created for use with Newflow Dynamic Modbus Slave Simulator. It is a .CSV file that may contain optional XML-format control information. The information an NFW file contains is used to simulate modbus and device operation, to project how a modbus slave system would operate under certain conditions."

      "Newflow is a hardware and software developer best known for their NÅNO Flow Computer and NÅNO RMU (Remote Measurement Unit) devices. These devices allow users to monitor the flow of liquids and gases (and accompanying data, such as temperature and pressure) through systems.",
      "To allow users to simulate how Newflow devices and associated flow systems would operate under certain conditions, Newflow provides a Dynamic Modbus Slave Simulator. This simulator, also referred to as the P577 app, loads configuration files saved in the NFW format. It then uses these configuration files to start and run simulations."
