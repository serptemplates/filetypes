      "Youtube-dl is a command-line program that can be used to download videos from YouTube.com. When a user uses youtube-dl to download a video, the program creates an .MP4 or .MKV file that contains the video, and it creates several other related files. One of the created files is a DESCRIPTION file.",
      "The DESCRIPTION file contains the video's official YouTube description at the time of download. Users often keep DESCRIPTION files on hand so they can remember what content a downloaded video contained. If a user uploads the video to a file hosting website, they may also upload the DESCRIPTION file to provide context for the video. For example, youtube-dl users who upload videos to the Internet Archive usually upload DESCRIPTION files alongside videos.",
