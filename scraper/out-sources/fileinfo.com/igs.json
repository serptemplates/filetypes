      "You can open IGS files with various desktop CAD programs, such as Autodesk Fusion 360 (Windows), Dassault Systemes CATIA (multiplatform), Nemetschek VectorWorks (multiplatform), and CADEX CAD Exchanger (macOS). You can also open and view IGS files with online viewers by uploading them to CADEX CAD Exchanger Cloud or ShareCAD.org.",
      "Since IGS files store plain text information, you can open them with a text editor (you may need to change the .igs file extension to .txt). However, when viewing the files with a text editor, the contents will appear as text instead of a visual representation of a model, like when you view them with CAD software. You can use text editors, such as Microsoft Wordpad (bundled with Windows) or Apple TextEdit (bundled with macOS), to view the plain text in IGS files."
