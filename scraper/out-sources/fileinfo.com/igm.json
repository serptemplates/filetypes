      "An IGM file is a material created by Glare Technologies Indigo Renderer, an app for generating photorealistic 3D images. It stores the graphical properties of a material in the XML standard that gives the surface of a 3D object a realistic appearance, such as that of metal, wood, plastic, brick, or liquid. IGM files may be included as part of an Indigo Renderer scene (.IGS file)."

      "Indigo Renderer is a multiplatform 3D rendering application that allows professional artists to create photorealistic images. Artists may create architectural mockups, video game scenes, film special effects, and more. The software is available as a standalone application or as a plugin for other 3D CAD programs.",
