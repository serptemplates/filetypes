      "A VSDX file is a drawing created by Microsoft Visio, an application for making diagrams, such as flowcharts, organizational charts, network schematics, and other visual plans. It stores elements like shapes, connectors, text, and layout data on a flexible canvas, allowing users to represent complex ideas in a visual format."

    "content": [
      "Microsoft introduced the VSDX format with Visio 2013 to replace older formats, including the binary .VSD and XML-based .VDX files used in earlier versions. VSDX is now the default file format in Visio 2013 and later, although those versions still support opening and editing legacy VSD and VDX files.",
      "VSDX files are based on the Open Packaging Conventions (OPC) standard, which means they are essentially .ZIP archives containing multiple .XML files and other resources. These internal components include \"document\" parts that store diagram content and metadata, as well as \"relationship\" parts that define links between elements like images, themes, and data sources. This structure makes VSDX files more flexible and easier to integrate with other software systems.",
      "NOTE: Other related Visio file types include .VSDM macro-enabled drawings, .VSTX templates, .VSTM macro-enabled templates, .VSSX stencils, and .VSSM macro-enabled stencils. Each serves a different purpose in the Visio ecosystem."

      "Nektony VSD Viewer (macOS, Android, iOS)",
      "Google Chrome web browser (with the Free Visio Viewer extension installed)",
      "If you do not have a program that supports the VSDX format you can still view the contents of a VSDX file by renaming the .vsdx extension to .zip and unzipping the file with Microsoft Windows Explorer (bundled with Windows) or Apple Archive Utility (bundled with macOS). Keep in mind that viewing the contents of a VSDX file using this method differs from viewing it with an application that supports the format."
