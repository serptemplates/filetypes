    "description": [
      "An EDRW file is a 2D CAD drawing created by Dassault Systèmes eDrawings Publisher, a plugin available for various CAD applications. It stores a design, including its components, assemblies, casings, and construction materials, in the eDrawings (EDRW) format, a lightweight, view-only format. eDrawings users typically share EDRW files with other eDrawings users to review mechanical design drawings, such as gear assemblies or engine components."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "eDrawings Publisher works with popular CAD programs like SolidWorks, AutoCAD, CATIA, Autodesk Inventor, and Trimble SketchUp, allowing users to export models in the eDrawings format. EDRW files are compressed and optimized for easy sharing, especially with collaborators who don't have access to the original CAD software.",
      "EDRW files are designed specifically for eDrawings Viewer (also known simply as \"eDrawings\"), a free application for Windows, macOS, iOS, and Android. The EDRW is read-only (users cannot edit it), making it a good option for securely distributing technical drawings for review and presentation.",
      "NOTE: Dassault Systemes SolidWorks eDrawings Viewer can also create EDRW files, but the majority of users export the files with the eDrawings Publisher plugin."

The desktop and mobile applications include tools that allow users to switch between drawing views and examine drawings in depth. eDrawings Viewer allows users to print drawings and export them in other file formats.",
