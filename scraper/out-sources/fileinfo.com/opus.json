      "An OPUS file is an audio file created in the Opus format, a lossy audio format developed for Internet streaming. It uses both the SILK (used by Skype) and CELT (from Xiph.Org) codecs and supports variable bit rates from 6 kb/s to 510 kb/s. OPUS files are most commonly saved using the Ogg audio container format. Thus, the files are sometimes referred to as Ogg Opus files."
