      "A DRP file is a project file created by Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve, a video editing and color correction program. It contains data used to load a video editing project in Resolve, as well as the project's properties. DRP files do not directly contain any video, audio, or other media files. Instead, they contain references to the media files a project includes."

      "DaVinci Resolve is a popular free video editing program. It allows users to combine, layer, trim, and add effects to video, audio, and image files, before combining the files into a final, rendered video.",
      "By default, DaVinci Resolve does not save users' video editing projects in a single file. Instead, it saves the configuration files that comprise a project in Resolve's installation directory. However, if you want to manually back up a project, you can export the project as a DRP file. You can do this by selecting File → Export Project... from Resolve's menu bar.",
      "NOTE: If you save your project as a DRP file, keep in mind that you will also have to retain copies of the media files your project contains, as DRP files contain only a record of a project's timeline, edits, and settings."
