      "An HLX file is a support file associated with ATI (now AMD) Radeon video cards that helped manage video driver functions. ATI video drivers referenced the information in HLX files to ensure proper communication between the operating system and the Radeon graphics hardware to maintain smooth video performance and display output, especially for graphics-intensive activities, such as gaming and video editing."
