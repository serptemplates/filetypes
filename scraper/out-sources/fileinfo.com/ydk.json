      "A YDK file contains a Yu-Gi-Oh! deck used by various Yu-Gi-Oh! card dueling programs, such as YGOPRO, YGOPRODeck, Duelingbook, and Yu-Gi-Oh! Dueling Nexus. It stores multiple passcodes that correspond to a deck of virtual playing cards in the Yu-Gi-Oh! game. The card dueling game then displays the appropriate life points, counters, and effects for the cards."
