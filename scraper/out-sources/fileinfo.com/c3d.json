      "A C3D file is a data file saved in the Coordinate 3D (C3D) format, which contains biomechanical information. It stores three-dimensional motion capture data in a compact binary structure and is a standard format for biomechanics data storage."

      "Coordinate 3D was designed for flexible and extensible data storage. It allows users to store and modify custom parameters in addition to the standard biomechanics parameters and raw data.",
      "The C3D format was originally developed by Dr. Andrew Dainis at ADTech in the early 1980s and remains the standard for 3D biomechanical gait and motion data. It enables 3D data to be shared across clinical, research, and movie industries. Full details of the format are available on the C3D.org website."
