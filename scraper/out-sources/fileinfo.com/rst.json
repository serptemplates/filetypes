      "An RST file is a text file that contains code written in the reStructuredText markup language. reStructuredText is used to apply basic styles and formatting to plain text documents. RST files most commonly contain technical documentation for Python programs, though they may also contain text that is meant to be converted into an eBook, simple webpage, or other document."

      "reStructuredText is a file format and markup language that software developers and technical writers use to produce technical documentation for Python-based software programs. When processed using the Python Docutils tool or another documentation-processing program, the markup symbols that reStructuredText (RST) files contain are transformed into text formatting.",
