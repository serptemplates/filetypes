      "An XFL file is an animation used by Adobe Animate, an app for creating various types of animations, such as banner advertisements and playful cartoons. It is similar to the default Animate .FLA Animation format but is saved in an uncompressed format, allowing multiple Animate users to work on different elements of the animation at the same time."

      "Animate is an application available with the Creative Cloud (CC). Designers and developers may use the software to create animations for various contexts, including the web, TV, and games.",
      "As you create your animation with Animate, you can save it as an XFL file to preserve your progress. While you will likely save the animation as a packaged FLA file, you can save it as an XFL file if you want access to the components of the animation. To save an animation as an XFL file with Animate, select File → Save As..., then choose \"Animate Uncompressed Document\" from the \"File Format\" dropdown menu.",
      "After saving the XFL file, Animate creates a folder named after the animation that stores the XFL file and the animation's assets. Some items include bin, LIBRARY, and META-INF folders and assets (bitmap graphics, audio files, etc.). The folder also contains various .XML files, such as a MobileSettings.xml file (contains mobile settings) and a PublishSettings.xml file (contains publish settings).",
