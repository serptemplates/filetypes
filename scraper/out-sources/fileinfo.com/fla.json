      "An FLA file is an animation project created by Adobe Animate, a program used to draw and publish interactive animations.

      "Animate was formerly known as Flash, which Macromedia originally developed, but then merged with Adobe in 2005. Flash saved projects as FLA files, and users often exported them as .SWF animations and videos for use on the web, as most web browsers supported them via the Flash plugin.",
      "As other technologies, such as HTML5, surpassed Flash, Adobe replaced the Flash software with Animate in 2016 and ended support for the Flash plugin in 2020. Now, FLA files are associated with Adobe Animate software",
      "You can create many types of animations with Animate, including website banner advertisements, tutorials, and playful cartoons, then export them to various multimedia formats. As you create your animation, you can save it as an FLA file to preserve your progress. To save an animation as an FLA file with Animate, select File → Save or Save As."
