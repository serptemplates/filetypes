      "You can open a GGB file in GeoGebra Classic (cross-platform), GeoGebra Graphing Calculator (cross-platform), and other GeoGebra apps. For example, to open a GGB file in the online version of GeoGebra Classic, open the program's menu, select the Open button, and then select the Folder icon. Then, navigate to and open your GGB file.",
      "Advanced GeoGebra users who want to modify the XML that a GGB file uses to display a worksheet can do so by unzipping the GGB file and then opening and editing the archive's XML file in any text or source code editor. GeoGebra recommends that you create a backup of your GGB file before editing its component XML."
