      "An RVP file is a firmware file used by Sharp Blu-ray players, primarily BD-HP20U players. It contains a firmware update to improve the performance of a Blu-ray player and keep up with technological advancements. RVP files are used for a variety of updates such as the playback of movies released by certain studios or the clarity of audio."

      "You will most likely only come across the RVP file if you are updating the firmware for your Sharp Blu-ray player. The firmware comes packaged in a .ZIP archive that you can download from the Sharp website.",
      "After you download the ZIP file you can extract the RVP file and place it on a USB flash drive. The USB stick's filesystem must be FAT16 or else the Blu-ray player will not be able to read it. After placing the RVP file on the USB stick, insert it into the USB port on the Blu-ray player and follow the player's manual for applying the firmware update."
