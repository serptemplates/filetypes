      "The .opdownload extension indicates that the download is incomplete. The extension is removed once the download is complete, and the file is then ready to be used.",

      "NOTE: OPDOWNLOAD files are similar to .CRDOWNLOAD files used by Google Chrome and to .DOWNLOAD files, which are used by Apple Safari."
