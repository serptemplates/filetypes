      "BKP files are typically backup files, which contain a redundant copy of a document, database, project, or other data. Some applications automatically create BKP files at regular intervals, to back up users' data. This allows users to restore their data if the original version of the backup file goes missing or becomes corrupted."

In most cases, BKP files have filenames similar to the files for which they are a backup. For example, a BKP file created from database.db would likely be named database.db.bkp or database.bkp."
