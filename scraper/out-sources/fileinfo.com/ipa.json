      "IPA files are not meant to be opened. Instead, they are meant to be installed on iOS devices or Macs that use an M1 chip. Installing an IPA file allows a user to run the iOS application the file contains.",
      "Those who still have access to Apple iTunes (Windows, Mac) can use iTunes to install IPA files on their iOS devices. To do so:",
      "Connect your iOS device to your computer.",
      "Open iTunes and, in the Devices section of the program's sidebar, locate your iOS device.",
      "Drag your IPA file to your device's listing in iTunes.",
      "Your iOS device will then install the app your IPA file contains.",
      "Those who do not have access to iTunes can use Apple Finder (Mac), Apple Configurator 2 (Mac), Cydia Impactor (multiplatform), 3uTools (Windows), Sideloadly! (Windows and Mac), or AltStore (iOS) to install the app an IPA file contains. The workflow for installing IPA files via Finder is similar to the workflow for installing them via iTunes (connect your iOS device to your Mac, locate your device in Finder, drag and drop your IPA file on your device's listing). The other applications all use unique workflows to install IPA files on iOS devices.",
      "On a Mac that uses an M1 chip, you can install the app an IPA file contains by double-clicking the file. The app will then appear in your Mac's Applications folder."
