      "A U file is a class package used by Unreal Tournament and other games built with the Unreal Engine. It contains compiled UnrealScript classes and settings that define gameplay behavior, objects, and logic. U files are used to add various features, such as weapons, power-ups, AI behavior, or even full game modes."

    "content": [
      "Developers and modders use tools provided by Epic Games, such as ucc.exe (Unreal Command Console), to compile their custom scripts into U files. Once compiled, users can distribute U files and drop them into the appropriate folder to modify or extend a game, similar to a plugin. For example, a modder might create a new weapon or character class in UnrealScript, compile it into a U file, and then load it into Unreal Tournament to use it during gameplay.",
      "U files are typically stored in the game's System folder (for example, \\​Unreal\\​System\\​). When a game launches, the engine loads the relevant U files from the System directory to access the necessary gameplay code."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "U files are not meant to be opened. Instead, the game packaged with the U file references it to load the information it stores.",
      "However, gamers who enjoy modifying gameplay may extract and modify U files with tools, such as Dragon UnPACKer and Unreal Tournament Package Tool."
