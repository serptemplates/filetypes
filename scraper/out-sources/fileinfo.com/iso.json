In Windows 8 and later, you can mount an ISO file without third-party software by choosing the file and then selecting Manage → Mount in File Explorer.",
      "In macOS, you can mount an ISO file by double-clicking the file. After clicking the file, the DiskImageMounter utility bundled with macOS verifies the disk image's integrity and mounts it after confirming the disk image.",
      "You can extract files from an ISO archive to access individual files, such as .BIN or .CFG files. You can use various archive utilities, including Corel WinZip, 7-Zip, and RARLAB WinRAR to extract files from an ISO file.",
      "While burning ISO files to discs is no longer as common as it once was, you may still want to burn an ISO file to a disc to create a physical backup or share data or media. In Windows 7 and later, you can right-click an ISO file and select Burn Disk Image. You can also burn ISO files to discs with third-party software, such as Roxio Toast and PowerISO."
