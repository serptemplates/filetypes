      "You can open KML files with a variety of mapping applications for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS. The Google Earth web browser application and Google Earth Pro desktop application are common choices.",

      "Since KML files are saved in a plain text, XML-like format, you can open them with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (macOS).",
      "NOTE: You can also open a KML file in Google Maps by hosting it on an online location and then typing the URL in the Google Maps search box. For example, if you host your KML file at http://mywebsite.com/myfile.kml, then type this URL in the Google Maps search box to display it.",
      "Alternatively, you can construct the URL yourself in Google Maps by prefixing your KML file's URL with http://maps.google.com/maps?q=. For example, to open the same KML file from above, you can use the following URL:",
      "http://maps.google.com/maps?q=http://mywebsite.com/myfile.kml",
      "This procedure also works for Google Earth View, the 3D earth-browsing plug-in you can add to your web browser."
