      "You can open SW3 files (Scriptware Screenplays) in Cinovation Scriptware (Windows, Mac). No other programs can open SW3 files. Scriptware is not compatible with newer versions of Windows and macOS, so you may have difficulty opening your SW3 files.",
      "Provided you can open your SW3 files in Cinovation Scriptware, you can convert the files into ASCII text documents or Final Draft documents. To do so, select File → Export as... from Scriptware's menu bar, and then select either the ASCII or Tabbed (Final Draft) formats. You can open ASCII text documents in Microsoft Word and other word processing programs."
