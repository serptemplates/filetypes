      "VTYM files are encrypted, and they cannot be decrypted or opened. The best option to restore VTYM-encrypted files is likely to perform a System Restore. Performing a System Restore will cause you to lose any data created in the interval between now and your last restore point. Therefore, you may want to back up any data and files created since your last restore point."
