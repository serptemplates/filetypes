      "A PRSX file is a slide show created by Presentations, a slide show presentations program included in the SoftMaker Office suite. It contains one or more slides that may include text, images, video, animations, tables, shapes, and other objects. PRSX files are similar to .PRDX files but are created to store a finalized slide show."

      "PRSX files are saved in a proprietary format and are similar to .PPSX files saved by Microsoft PowerPoint. They are designed for storing a completed slide show and when they are double-clicked, the slide show begins full screen on the user's computer. PRSX files are also useful for sending finished presentations to other Presentations users."
