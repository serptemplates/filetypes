      "An IGMESH file contains mesh information in an object included in an Indigo Renderer 3D Scene (.IGS). It contains various mesh information, including an array of vertex positions, shading information, UV mappings, and materials used by the mesh. IGMESH files define shapes in scenes by providing a structural build (consisting of vertices, faces, and edges) of a 3D model."

      "Indigo Renderer and Indigo RT are multiplatform 3D rendering applications primarily used by professional artists to generate photorealistic images. Indigo RT is similar to Indigo Renderer but offers fewer capabilities and is less expensive. Additionally, Indigo RT is available as a plugin for other 3D CAD software.",
      "You will likely encounter IGMESH files accompanying IGS files in a scene folder. The folder will likely be the same name as the IGS file but with _meshes appended. For example, if the IGS file is example_scene.igs, then the folder storing the IGMESH files will be named example_scene_meshes.igs.",
      "Typically, there are numerous IGMESH files in the folder, and their names begin with mesh, followed by a string of numbers. An example IGMESH file looks like this: mesh_7945098992065549788.igmesh."
