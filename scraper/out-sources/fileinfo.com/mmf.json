      "In 1999, Yamaha introduced the SMAF sound format. This format was designed for use with the MA-1 sound chip, which was included in several mobile phones. Successive versions of the MA-1 chip, named MA-2, MA-3, MA-5, and MA-7, were included in more mobile phones, produced by LG, Motorola, Samsung, Panasonic, and other companies.",
      "All MA-# chips can play audio saved in the SMAF format. Most of these SMAF audio files use the .mmf extension. (Some instead use the .mld extension). Users create MMF files by importing .WAV or .MID audio into Yamaha SMAF Tools and converting it to the SMAF format.",
      "NOTE: Some MMF files also include graphics, which can be shown on a mobile phone."
