      "A DIVX file is a video file encoded using the DivX codec, a technology developed by DivX to compress video data while maintaining good visual quality. It supports high-definition video resolutions, including up to 1080p (a display resolution with a pixel count of 1920 by 1080), often storing movies, TV shows, and other high-quality video content. DIVX files became especially popular in the early 2000s during the rise of digital video downloads and CD/DVD video storage."

    "content": [
      "The DivX format is based on MPEG-4 Part 2 video compression and has evolved to support advanced features like multiple audio tracks, subtitles, chapters, and menu navigation. While it began as a proprietary format for Windows-based PCs, support for DivX playback expanded over time to include many third-party media players, DVD and Blu-ray players, gaming consoles, and smart TVs. However, the format has become less common in recent years due to the rise of newer codecs like H.264 and H.265."
