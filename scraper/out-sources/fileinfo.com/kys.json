      "KYS files can be created and loaded from Photoshop's Keboard Shortcuts & Menus window, which can be opened by choosing Window → Workspace → Keyboard Shortcuts & Menus... from the application menu.",
      "Examples of common Photoshop keyboard shortcuts include Cmd-Shift-N for creating a new layer, and Cmd-Opt-I, which opens the resizing window. Functions that that don't have default shortcuts, such as the Brightness/Contrast window, can have their own shortcuts applied and saved to a KYS file. Default shortcuts may also be overwritten.",
