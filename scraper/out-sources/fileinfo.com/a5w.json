      "Server-side webpage used by Alpha Five, a rapid application development (RAD) tool used for creating Web applications; similar to an .ASP or .PHP page but is written using Alpha Five syntax; often contains dynamic webpage components such as dialogs and forms; used for developing desktop-like applications that run in a Web browser."

      "A5W files contain standard webpage code as well as source code written in using Alpha Five syntax. The Alpha Five source code is demarcated by the open and close tags <%a5 and a5>. When a user's Web browser requests an A5W webpage, the Alpha Five server parses the Alpha Five source code and then returns the resulting webpage to the user's browser.",
      "NOTE: Since A5W files are webpages, you may see a trailing \".a5w\" in your browser's URL when going to an Alpha Five application page, similarly to how you would see a trailing \".html\" for a plain HTML webpage."
