      "An F77 file contains source code written in the Fortran 77 (F77) programming language. It is used to compile a Fortran 77 program using the language's compiler, which is also named F77."

      "F77 is a programming language often used for performing scientific and numerical computations. It is a variant of the original Fortran programming language. The original Fortran language was released in 1957; F77 was released in 1977. Notably, F77 includes support for structured programming and character-based data, while the original Fortran language did not.",
      "While most developers save their F77 source code in .FOR or .F files, so they are easily recognizable as Fortran-based source code files, some save their code in F77 files. This denotes that the files contain F77 source code specifically, and not code written using some other Fortran variant."
