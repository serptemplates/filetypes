      "A typical LST file contains a list of information, separated by line breaks. Examples include a list of files to be installed by a software installer, data exported from a spreadsheet, or database data dumped from another program.",
      "Since LST files are saved in a plain text format, they can be viewed and edited with a basic text editor. On rare occasions, an LST file may be saved in a binary format, which will not display recognizable information in a text editor. If this is the case, you will need to open the file with the program that originally created it."
