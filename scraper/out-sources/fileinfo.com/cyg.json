      "A CYG file is an object used in an Ashampoo home design project (.CYP file). It contains both a 3D and 2D representation of a door, window, appliance, column, or other home-related item. A default set of CYG files are included with the installation of Ashampoo 3D CAD Architecture, 3D CAD Professional, and Home Design."

      "Ashampoo offers several CAD applications that allow users to design homes, add-ons, and remodels. All of these applications save home designs in the CYP format and allow users to add CYG format objects.",
      "In Ashampoo's CAD applications, CYG files appear primarily as 3D objects that can be selected from the programs' Catalog. However, the files contain both a 2D and 3D representation of an object, and they can be added to either a design's 2D or 3D view. As you add an object to one view, it is simultaneously added to the other.",
      "NOTE: In Ashampoo CAD programs' Catalog, you can double-click a CYG object to view it at a larger size."

To do so, select the Catalog tab located near the programs' lower right-hand corner and then select the Open file... folder icon. The Open Object file window will appear, allowing you to navigate to and import your CYG file."
