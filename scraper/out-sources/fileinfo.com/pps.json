      "Several other presentation programs can open PPS files but they may not fully support the formatting of the slide show files. Alternative programs include Apache OpenOffice Impress (multiplatform), Ability Office (Windows), and Apple Keynote (Mac). If you are a Mac user simply looking to view a PPS file, you can use Apple Preview, which comes bundled with macOS.",
      "You can also open PPS files with various web programs. Google Slides is a free option you can access with a Google account. The web tool allows you to upload a PPS file and view, edit, save, and convert the slide show."
