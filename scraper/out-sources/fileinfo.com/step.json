      "A STEP file is a 3D model file formatted in STEP (Standard for the Exchange of Product Data), an ISO standard exchange format. It contains three-dimensional model data saved in a text format recognized by multiple computer-assisted design (CAD) programs."

      "The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) developed the STEP format to make it easier to share models between users with different CAD systems in the CAD industry. Since its release in 1994, STEP has become a standardized, widely-supported format that CAD users can use to save and transfer models between users and programs.",
      "While STEP files appear as 3D models in CAD programs, they consist of plain text that describes a model's structure. The text that STEP files contain is written in an ASCII format that conforms to the STEP Application Protocols ISO 10303-2xx.",
      "NOTE: STEP model files often use the .STP file extension."

      "Navigate to and open your STEP file",
      "Since STEP files are saved in plain text, you can open a STEP file with a text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad or Apple TextEdit. You can view the model's data and metadata, including its original file name, creation date, and the application that created the file.",
      "When opened in a text editor or source code editor, you can modify the properties of the STEP file. However, if you incorrectly edit the file, you may inadvertently corrupt the file."
