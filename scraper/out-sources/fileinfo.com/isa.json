      "An ISA file is an audio archive used by Indie Studios Colors, an unreleased game for the Gizmondo. It contains multiple .WAV files that store game music, sound effects, and other audio. For example, one of Colors' ISA files contains WAV files that comprise the majority of the game's soundtrack."

      "The Gizmondo is a handheld gaming console that was available in 2005 and 2006, before being discontinued. Colors is a Gizmondo game that was never officially released, as it was not completed before Gizmondo production ceased. However, unofficial, not-quite-complete versions of Colors are available online.",
      "In Colors, players engage in single-player or multiplayer third-person shooter gameplay. Notably, in the game's multiplayer mode, game levels are generated based on a player's real-life GPS coordinates. The game stores its audio files in a set of ISA archives, which group related audio together."
