      "A DATA file is a data file used by Analysis Studio, a statistical analysis and data mining program. It contains mined data in a plain text, tab-delimited format, including an Analysis Studio file header. DATA files are commonly used to store data for offline data analysis when not connected to an Analysis Studio server, but may also be used in online mode."

      "DATA files may contain data from multiple data sources, such as Microsoft Access and SQL Server databases. They are paired with a corresponding .STP file, which contains the project data schema and object information.",
