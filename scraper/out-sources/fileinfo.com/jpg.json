    "instructions": [
      "Most programs that can open JPG files can convert them to other image formats. For example, Microsoft Photos can convert JPG files to the .PNG, .TIFF, .BMP, and .JXR formats, and Apple Photos can convert JPG files to the PNG and TIFF formats.",
      "To convert a JPG file to another format, select your image viewer or editor's Save as or Export option. For example:",
      "In Microsoft Photos, select the ... button and then Save as.",
      "In Apple Photos, select File → Export → Export # Photos.",
      "Then, choose the format to which you want to convert your JPG file and finish the saving or exporting process.",
      "If you want to convert many JPG files to another format at once, however, you're better off using a batch conversion tool. For example, File Viewer Plus and Adobe Photoshop both include batch conversion tools that allow you to convert an entire set of JPG files to another image format all at once."
