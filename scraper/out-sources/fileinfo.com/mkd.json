It is saved in plain text format but includes inline text symbols that define how to format the text (e.g., bold, indentations, headers, table formatting). MKD files may also be saved as .MD, .MARKDOWN, or .MDOWN files"

However, they are not only useful for HTML documentation systems, but also for source code version control.
