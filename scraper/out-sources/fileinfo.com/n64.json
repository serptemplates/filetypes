      "An N64 file is a Nintendo 64 (N64) game ROM that gamers can run on a computer with an N64 emulator, such as Nemu64 and Mupen64. It contains an exact copy of game data dumped from the original N64 cartridge, which the emulator plays just as if it were the actual console playing a game cartridge."

      "Nintendo released the Nintendo 64 in 1996. The home video game console utilizes cartridges to store games. Popular games for the console include Super Mario 64, Mario Kart 64, GoldenEye 007, and Star Fox 64.",
      "Retro gamers who enjoy N64 games dump game data from the cartridge with special hardware and software, then save the game in the N64 format on their computers. Then, they play the game saved in the N64 file with an emulator on their computer. Some gamers may also upload the N64 ROM file online to share it with other gamers, who can then download and play the game."
