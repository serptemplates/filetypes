      "3GPP is a multimedia container format based on the ISO media file format. It stores video streams as H.263 or H.264 and audio streams as AMR-WB, AMR-WB+, AMR-NB, HE-AAC v1, AAC-LC, or Enhanced aacPlus.",
      "3GP files are commonly used by 3G mobile phones that support video capture but may also be played on select 2G and 4G phones. An example of when you might encounter a 3GP video is when you are in a message thread with Android and iPhone users, and one of the users shares a recorded video with the whole thread. While 3GP files are still used, they have decreased as more efficient video formats have replaced the 3GPP format.",
