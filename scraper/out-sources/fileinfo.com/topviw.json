      "A TOPVIW file is a CAD document created by TopSolid, a CAD design and product data management (PDM) application. It contains a CAD drawing exported from TopSolid, but does not include all design information such as the complete models and Bill of Materials (BoM) data. TOPVIW files can be opened with the free TopSolid'Viewer program."

    "content": [
      "TOPVIW files are used for storing drafts of CAD drawings for review and sharing over the Internet. Since TOPVIW files only contain a subset of the design information, they are smaller in size than the original design document. Additionally, this format helps to protect confidential information when sending drafts to external entities."
