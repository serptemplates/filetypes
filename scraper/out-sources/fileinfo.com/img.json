For example, IMG files created by SlySoft CloneCD must be paired with an associated .CCD and .SUB file before they can be used to create a disc. Before using an IMG file to create a new disc, you should attempt to determine what program created the IMG file and check whether your disc-authoring program can burn files saved in that format."
