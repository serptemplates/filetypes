      "An FZBZ file is a compressed copy of a parts bin used by Fritzing, an electronic circuit prototyping and design application. It is an archive that contains an .FZB file, multiple .FZP files, and multiple .SVG files. FZBZ files are commonly used to share parts among Fritzing users."

      "Arduino and printed circuit board (PCB) enthusiasts use Fritzing to prototype PCB layouts. These layouts contain a variety of circuit parts, which users store and organize in Fritzing part bins.",
      "Typically, Fritzing part bins are saved as FZB files, which are XML files that describe the parts a bin includes. However, when a user exports a bin, the bin is saved as an FZBZ file, which is a compressed archive that contains not only the bin's FZB file, but also the FZP and SVG files needed to import the bin into another instance of Fritzing. This allows users to easily export and share their parts bins with other users.",
      "To export a Fritzing bin as an FZBZ file, select the bin in Fritzing's Parts window, right-click, and then select Export Bin...."

To import an FZBZ file, right-click in Fritzing's Parts window, select Import..., and then navigate to and select your FZBZ file. The bin your FZBZ file includes will then appear in Fritzing's Parts window."
