      "An SF file stores a digital signature used by Minecraft to verify the integrity and authenticity of the game's core files. It is named CODESIGN.SF and is located in the META-INF directory inside the Minecraft.jar file. Since Minecraft is written in Java, this type of signature file is part of Java's standard way of signing .JAR (Java Archive) files to prevent tampering."

    "content": [
      "The CODESIGN.SF file works with a companion .RSA file (named CODESIGN.RSA), which contains the actual cryptographic signature. Together, these files ensure that the archive's contents haven't been changed or corrupted.",
      "If either SF or RSA file is modified or removed, Minecraft may fail to launch or run correctly. Earlier versions of Minecraft used the name MOJANG_C.SF for this file, but it was later renamed to CODESIGN.SF in newer builds."
