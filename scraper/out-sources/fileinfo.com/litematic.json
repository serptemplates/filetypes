      "A LITEMATIC file is a schematic created by Litematica (Fabric Minecraft Modloader), a mod for Minecraft. It is similar to a .SCHEM file in that it contains a blueprint of an area within a Minecraft world that a player can share and replicate. For example, Minecraft gamers often create schematics for structures, such as castles or factories, and save them as LITEMATIC files."

      "Minecraft is a 3D sandbox construction game. The game allows players to use various unofficial add-ons and mods to enhance their gameplay. The Litematica includes most of the features available with the old Schematica and also provides some new capabilities.",
      "Litematica's main capability is that it can display a schematic of an area with information on how to build it (e.g., where to place the blocks) and highlights missing, extra, or wrongly placed blocks. When you create a schematic of a selected area with Litematica, the mod saves it as a LITEMATIC file."
