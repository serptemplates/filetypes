      "A GBR file contains printed circuit board (PCB) design data in Gerber format, which is an industry-standard file format supported by many PCB design systems. It contains instructions for drilling and milling the board and includes information about the board's electrical connections. GBR files are commonly used by PCB professionals to securely exchange image, drill, and rout data from design software to manufacturing machines."
