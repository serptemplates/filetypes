      "Since SKM files are Zip-compressed packages, you can also open them with an archive utility, such as Windows File Explorer or Apple Archive Utility. You may need to rename the .skm file extension to .zip for the compression utility to recognize it. After you extract its contents, you can view the XML, PNG, and JPG files that comprise the material."
