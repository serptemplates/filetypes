      "A PMLZ file is a zipped archive that contains one or more Palm Markup Language (.PML) files. It is used to create an eBook, saved in the Palm Database (.PDB) format. As Palm personal digital assistants (PDAs) are now uncommon, so are PMLZ files."

    "content": [
      "Many Palm PDAs included an app known as eReader or Palm Reader. This app allowed users to read eBooks saved in the PDB format.",
      "To create a PDB file, eBook publishers created one or more PML files, which defined the eBook's content and formatting. Optionally, users could zip several PML files together into a PMLZ file, and then use that file to create their PDB eBook."
