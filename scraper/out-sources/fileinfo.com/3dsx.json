      "3DSX files are not meant to be opened on a PC. Instead, you should use your PC's file explorer to place your 3DSX file on your Nintendo 3DS's SD card (which can be connected to your PC using an SD card reader).",
      "Typically, you should place 3DSX files other than boot.3dsx in your SD card's 3ds folder. (If your SD card does not have a 3ds folder, you will have to create one.) To run some 3DSX apps, you may instead need to create an app-specific sub-folder inside the 3ds folder and place your 3DSX file in that folder."
