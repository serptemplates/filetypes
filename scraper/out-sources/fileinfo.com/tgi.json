      "Degi Trans TowGeom is an online program that allows engineers to quickly create 3D and 2D models of transmission towers. While designing a tower, engineers can enter inputs that create that tower's geometry. They can then save these inputs as TGI files.",
      "Each TGI file contains data about a tower's panels, including the panels' number, height, and pattern name, and slopes, including the number of slopes and their widths. TowGeom's pattern library includes pre-existing tower geometry patterns, which engineers can load in TowGeom."
