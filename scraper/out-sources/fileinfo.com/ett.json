      "ETT files are similar to ET files, storing rows and columns of data, charts, and graphs, but they are primarily used for duplicating spreadsheets with similar layouts and information. The Spreadsheets program comes bundled with several ETT templates and allows you to download many more directly through the application. ETT templates can also be converted to other spreadsheet files such as .XLT, .XLTX, .XLS and .XLSX files.",
