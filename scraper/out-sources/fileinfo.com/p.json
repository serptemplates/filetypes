      "A P file is a pickle file created by pickle, a Python module used for converting Python objects to a byte representation for storage on disk or transfer over a network. It allows for objects to be conveniently stored or transmitted without first having to convert the data to another format. P files can be \"unpickled\" and loaded back into program memory during runtime."

This may also be referred to as \"serialization.\" The Python scripting language is typically used for programming web applications and dynamic web content.",
