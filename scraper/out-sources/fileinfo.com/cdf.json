      "A CDF file is an interactive document saved in the Computable Document Format (CDF), a document standard developed by Wolfram Research. It may contain text, visual elements, such as interactive graphs or images, Wolfram Language input or output, and page formatting information. Wolfram discontinued the CDF format in 2021 in favor of the interactive Mathematica Notebook (.NB) format."

      "Various types of Wolfram software users, such as teachers, scientists, and publishers, may save documents as CDF files. Typically, they open the files with Wolfram Research Player or Mathematica when displaying business presentations, reading journal articles, or interacting with e-learning materials such as textbooks and tutorials. The format also allows users to load visualization data on-demand from within the CDF file."
