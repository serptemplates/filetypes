      "If a player wants to disable a previously-installed Minecraft mod, one of the easiest ways to do so is by changing the file's extension so Minecraft does not recognize the file as a valid mod file. Most often, players and mod management applications disable mods by adding the .disabled extension to the end of the mod's file name. For example, if a player disables a mod using MultiMC, the program automatically appends .disabled to that mod's file name."
