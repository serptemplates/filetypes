      "A JET file is a settings file used by The Jackbox Party Pack series of video games. It contains JSON- or XML-formatted text that defines settings for a specific Party Pack party game. For example, in The Jackbox Party Pack 2, the game Earwax uses a JET file named EarwaxAudio.jet to retrieve and play audio files."
