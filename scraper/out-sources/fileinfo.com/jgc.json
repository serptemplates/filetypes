      "A JGC file contains a ROM image of a video game for Dingoo A320, a Chinese handheld gaming console released in 2009. It contains an exact copy of a game developed by JungleTac, which is a Chinese company that creates 8-bit and 16-bit games and consoles. JGC files can be played with various emulators in Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS."

      "JGC files are saved in a format similar to the common Game Boy Advance .GBA format, which is used for storing Game Boy Advance game ROMs. However, JGC files are used to store ROMs dumped from Dingoo A320 game cartridges instead of Game Boy Advance cartridges.",
      "These dumped game ROM files allow nostalgic or curious gamers to play the games on a modern operating system using an emulator. Some examples of games stored in JGC files include Tiger Rescue, Fire Fighter, Jewel Master, and Manic Troll.",
      "There are a variety of emulators for Windows, macOS, Linux, Android, and iOS that support JGC files. Some of the emulators include NO$GBA, VisualBoyAdvance, DreamGBA, KiGB, GBA4iOS, and GBAoid."
