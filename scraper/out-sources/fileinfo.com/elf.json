      "An ELF file is an executable file meant to be used with a Nintendo Wii or Nintendo Wii emulator. It contains a video game or other Wii application. ELF files may contain official Wii applications or homebrew applications."

    "content": [
      "ELF files are similar to .DOL files, in that they are used to distribute Nintendo Wii games and other applications. However, ELF files contain extraneous debugging information that DOL files do not. For that reason, gamers prefer to distribute Wii applications as DOL files."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "On PCs, you can open an ELF file and launch the game or other application it contains using Dolphin, a cross-platform Nintendo Wii emulator. On a Nintendo Wii, you can open an ELF file by transferring the file to your Wii using an SD card and then opening the file via the Homebrew Channel.",
      "In some cases, you may need to convert an ELF file to a DOL file in order to open it. You can convert ELF files to DOL files using the ELF to DOL Converter (cross-platform). The converter is a .BAT script that automatically converts ELF files to DOL files."
