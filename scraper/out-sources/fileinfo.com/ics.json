      "If you are having trouble importing your ICS file into a calendar application, you can open the file in any text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (Mac), to view the event information it contains. For example, you can see the event's start and end times (including time zone) listed in the file's DTSTART and DTEND lines. While opening an ICS file with a text editor is not the best way to view an event's details, it does allow you to view the information without a calendar application."
