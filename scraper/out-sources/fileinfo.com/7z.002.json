      "A 7Z.002 file is the second part of a multi-volume .7Z archive. It must always be paired with an accompanying .7Z.001 file to extract the files it contains. If the 7Z.002 file is part of a large multi-volume archive, it must also be matched with additional 7Z.### files (7Z.003, 7Z.004, and so on)."

      "7-Zip is a free archiving utility available for Windows. Typically, when you archive one or more files using 7-Zip, the program compresses those files into a single 7Z archive. However, you can use 7-Zip's Split to volumes, bytes: feature to instead split compressed files across multiple 7Z archives. Multi-volume archives are saved as a series of 7Z.### files.",
      "The first file in a multi-volume archive always uses the .7z.001 extension. Additional files use extensions with incrementally higher numbers. For example, a multi-volume archive comprised of four files includes a .7z.001, .7z.002, .7z.003, and .7z.004 file."

      "Select your 7Z.001 file, and use your archive utility to extract its files. For example, if you are using B1 Free Archiver to extract files, navigate to your 7Z.001 file, right-click the file, and select Extract to → Extract here.",
