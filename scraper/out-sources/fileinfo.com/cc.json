      "You can open and edit CC files with many source code editors, such as Microsoft Visual Studio Code (multiplatform) and Code Blocks (multiplatform). These applications are ideal for viewing and editing CC files since they provide helpful tools, such as syntax highlighting and auto-completion.",
