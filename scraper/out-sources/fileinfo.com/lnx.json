      "An LNX file is an archive that contains one or more files that comprise a Commodore 64 game or program. It is packaged with the Lynx archiver program and is not compressed. Commodore 64 users often archived .D64 or .X64 files and any related files to upload to bulletin board systems (BBS) to share them with other computer enthusiasts."

      "Will Corley developed the Lynx (also known as LNX or Ultimate Lynx) format. The Lynx format was more common in the 1990s for uploading to a BBS but has since greatly decreased in usage due to the rise of other archiving formats, discontinuation of the Lynx archiver program, and the complexity of the Lynx format."
