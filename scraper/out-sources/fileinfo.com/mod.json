      "A MOD file is a music module file saved in the standard music module format, originating from the Amiga module format. It contains note patterns (similar to a .MIDI file) and sound samples representing different instruments played back according to the notes. MOD files are typically used for background music in video games and the \"demoscene\" computer art subculture."

      "Karsten Obarski initially developed the Amiga module format and released it with the Ultimate Soundtracker software for the Commodore Amiga system in 1987. As music trackers began supporting the format, especially on PCs in the 1990s, other developers released variations of the MOD format.",
      "Initially, the MOD format only supported four audio channels and sixteen instruments. However, recent MOD variations have increased the number of supported channels to 32 and supported instruments to 31.",
      "The sound samples within a module are assigned to different tracks and are played back according to the notes in the score. A MOD module also includes a list that tells the application playing the module the order the patterns are to be played.",
      "NOTE: MOD files may be created by various MOD trackers, including FastTracker, StarTrekker, Noise Tracker, MilkyTracker, and Cog."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open a MOD file with various audio players, such as Nullsoft Winamp (Windows), VideoLAN VLC media player (multiplatform), Schism Tracker (multiplatform), and MikMod (multiplatform). Unfortunately, some audio players that support MOD files may no longer be developed and not work on modern operating systems.",
      "On an Android device, you can play MOD files with Smarper Amiga Mod Player for Android, and on iOS devices, you can use PureModPlay or VividTracker to play MOD files."

  "how_to_convert": {
    "instructions": [
      "Several audio players, such as MilkyTracker (Windows) and Cog (macOS), can convert MOD music module files to other formats.",
      "For example, MilkyTracker can convert MOD files to the WAVE Audio (.WAV) and Fasttracker 2 Extended Module (.XM) formats."
