      "If necessary, you can also open a GSITE file in any text editor to view the URL, document ID, and Gmail account information it contains. You may want to do this, for example, if you are having trouble using your GSITE file to open a project in Google Sites. If double-clicking your GSITE file does not open a website project, you can try copying and pasting your file's URL into your web browser to access your website project."
