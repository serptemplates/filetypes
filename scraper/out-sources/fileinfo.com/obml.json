      "An OBML file is a webpage saved by Opera Mini, a mobile web browser. It contains source code formatted in the Opera Binary Markup Language (OBML), a compact format that reduces a webpage's size. OBML files were used to view webpages in Opera Mini while offline."

      "Opera Mini users can download webpages to view them without access to the Internet. In the past, when a user downloaded a webpage, Opera Mini saved the page as an OBML file. OBML files have since been replaced by .OBML15 and .OBML16 files. Versions 5 and higher of Opera Mini cannot open OBML files."

      "Previously, you could open OBML files in Opera Mini and programs that emulated Opera Mini, such as OperaMiniLargeDevice (Windows) and MicroEmulator (Windows). However, current versions of most of these programs cannot open OBML files. If you still have access to an old (version 4 or below) version of Opera Mini or an old Opera Mini emulator, you may be able to use it to open your OBML file."
