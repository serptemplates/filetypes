      "UIWIX ransomware uses an old Windows exploit to encrypt users' files and hold them for ransom. After the ransomware finishes encrypting a user's files, it produces plain text ransom notes named _DECODE_FILES.txt. These notes contain instructions a user is supposed to follow to pay a ransom and decrypt their files. (FileInfo recommends you never pay a ransom to decrypt your files.)",
      "Files encrypted by UIWIX ransomware are appended with a series of random numbers and the .uiwix extension. For example, a file named filename.jpg may become filename.jpg._2237325398.uiwix after encryption."

      "Because they have been encrypted by ransomware, you cannot open UIWIX files. Additionally, there are no known programs that allow users to decrypt UIWIX files themselves.",
