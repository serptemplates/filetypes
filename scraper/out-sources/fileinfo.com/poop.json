      "Because POOP files are encrypted, you cannot open them. The best option to restore your files to their original state is likely to perform a System Restore. Note that performing a System Restore will cause you to lose any data created in the interval between now and your last restore point. Therefore, you may want to back up any data and files created since your last restore point."
