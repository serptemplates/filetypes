      "An MTV file is a video saved in a specialized format used by some Chinese portable \"MP4\" video players. It contains MP3 audio and a series of images that are shown during playback, at a rate of 12 frames per second. MTV files are similar to .AMV files but use slightly different formatting."

    "content": [
      "Several inexpensive Chinese portable \"MP4\" players do not actually store or play MP4 videos. Instead, they play MTV videos. MTV videos are low resolution (a maximum of 128x128 pixels) and small in size (one minute of video is roughly 24 MB of data). Thus, media players can store and play many MTV videos without using much storage space or processing power.",
      "NOTE: While the MTV format is similar to the AMV format, which is also used by Chinese portable media players, the formats are different enough that not every AMV-compatible device or media player can play MTV files."

    "instructions": [
      "You can open and play MTV videos in VideoLAN VLC media player (cross-platform) or Online Media Technologies AVS Media Player (Windows), though the players may have difficulty playing some MTV files. For example, VLC is able to play only the audio portion of some MTV files.",
      "If you want to convert an MTV video to a more standard video format, such as AVI or .MP4, you can do so using FFmpeg (cross-platform), AnyMP4 Video Converter (Windows, Mac), or Online Media Technologies AVS Video Converter (Windows)."
