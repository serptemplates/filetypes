      "LaTeX is a document preparation system used primarily by academics, to format scientific documents for publication. To create a LaTeX document, a writer uses a LaTeX or plain text editor to define the document's elements and content using the LaTeX markup language. A publisher can then use a TeX publication program to transform the LaTeX document into a formatted .PDF or other publishable document.",

It allows professors (and others) to create databases of course exercises, proofs, definitions, and other LaTeX documents. (Often, one database per course.) The LaTeX documents that DataTex creates are saved as DTEX files.",
