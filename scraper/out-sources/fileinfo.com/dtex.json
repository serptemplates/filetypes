      "It is best to open DTEX files with DataTex. When you open a DTEX file with DataTex, the program will load the entire database within which that DTEX file is contained (provided you have access to the database). It will also show (and allow you to edit) the DTEX file's DataTex-specific metadata.",
      "However, you can also open a DTEX file with any LaTeX or plain text editor, just as you would a normal .TEX file. Some LaTeX editors include TeXWorks, Texmaker, and MiKTeX."
