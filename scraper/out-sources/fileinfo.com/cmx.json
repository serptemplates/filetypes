      "A CMX file is an image saved in the Corel Metafile Exchange (CMX) format and created by a Corel drawing or image editing program, such as CorelDRAW. It contains bitmap or vector image data, supporting colors in the RGB, CMYK, and Pantone color models. CMX files also store metadata that describes the image."

      "Corel created the CMX format as a proprietary image interchange format for transferring images from one Corel program to another. For example, you could previously save an image as a CMX file in CorelDRAW and then import that image into Corel Presentations for use on a slide.",
      "However, many Corel programs no longer support the CMX format. For example, you cannot import a CMX file into current versions of Corel Presentations, WordPerfect, or PaintShop Pro.",
      "NOTE: Different versions of Corel programs save CMX files in slightly different formats. Some programs allow you to save CMX files in both the current and legacy CMX formats (the CMX format is also known as the Corel Presentation Exchange Legacy format)."
