    "content": [
      "The KEYTAB file is used to authenticate a principal on a host to Kerberos without any user interaction or having to store a password in a plain text file. The file is encrypted but should be secured well because whoever has access to the file can act as that principal.",
      "Kerberos provides authentication tools and secret-key cryptography to secure communications by client/server applications. The Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) has made a free implementation of the protocol available in source form. The protocol is also available in a variety of commercial products."
