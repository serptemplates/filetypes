      "A CDX file contains an index of files or other data stored in a database. It is similar to a compact index (.IDX) file, but the leaf nodes at the lowest level of a compound index point to one of the tags in the index. CDX files were introduced in version 2 of Microsoft Visual FoxPro, which is a database management program for Windows."
