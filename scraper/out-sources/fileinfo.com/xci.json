      "XCI files can be played on a Nintendo Switch using SX OS, which can be booted on to a Switch console using the Xecuter SX Pro tool. The SX OS is custom firmware that allows you to play Nintendo Switch Homebrew and XCI backup files. XCI files require master keys to decrypt them so they should only be used if you own the game.",
      "XCI files may also be played using Switch emulator, such as Yuzu or Ryujinx, but they must be decrypted to .NRO files. You can decrypt XCI files using hactool, which is a utility developed by SciresM to decrypt, extract, and view information about various Nintendo Switch file formats."
