      "A GLTF file contains a 3D model saved in the GL Transmission Format (glTF). It stores a full scene description in JSON format, which includes node hierarchy, cameras, and materials. GLTF files also contain descriptor information about animations and meshes."

      "GLTF files can be used to save and share digital assets between different 3D modeling tools, similarly to .DAE files. However, they are also optimized for download speed and load time at runtime, which makes them easier to use in mobile- and web-based 3D modeling programs. Additionally, glTF is a more streamlined format for uploading and downloading from online digital asset databases, such as Remix 3D.",
      "GLTF files may include embedded resources or may reference external resources. If a GLTF file comes with separate resources, they most likely will be the following files:",
      "Binary (.BIN) files - One or more BIN files that contain animation, geometry, and other data.",
      "Shader (GLSL) files - One or more GLSL files that contain shaders.",
      "Image (.JPG, .PNG, etc.) files - One or more files that contain textures for the 3D model.",
      "The glTF is developed to be an efficient, extensible, interoperable format for the transmission and loading of 3D content. The goals of the format include compact file sizes, fast loading, complete 3D scene representation, runtime independence, and extensibility to accompany further development.
