      "A PI1 file is a bitmap image created by DEGAS, a graphics editor developed for Atari ST computers in the 1980s. It contains image data in a low-resolution format of 320x200 pixels and supports up to 16 colors (from the limited Atari palette). The PI1 format is one of several DEGAS image variants, each designed for a specific display mode supported by the Atari ST."

    "content": [
      "While PI1 files store low-resolution images, other variants such as PI2 and PI3 store medium- and high-resolution graphics. These files are saved in a simple bitmap format that stores the color information for each pixel, optimized for use on Atari's hardware.",
      "DEGAS was popular among Atari users for creating pixel art and simple digital graphics that matched the system's display capabilities. However, DEGAS and Atari ST systems are no longer in common use, and the PI1 format is uncommon."
