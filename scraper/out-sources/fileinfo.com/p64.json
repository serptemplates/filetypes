      "The P64 files are loadable libraries, similar to .DLL, that extends IDA's disassembling capabilities, such as the improvement of the analysis of Microsoft binaries with public debugging symbols. The P64 plugin should be placed in the /​plugin/​p64/​ directory.",
      "NOTE: Each IDA plugin uses a different extension depending on its operating system type. The .PLW extension is used for Windows 32-bit, the .PLX extension is used by Linux 32-bit, and the .PLX64 extension is used by Linux 64-bit plugins."
