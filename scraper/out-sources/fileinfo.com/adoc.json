After an author finishes editing the plain text version of an ADOC file, they typically use Asciidoctor or another text-processing program to convert their ADOC file into a formatted text file. For example, a technical writer may use Asciidoctor to convert an ADOC file into an HTML file, which can be hosted and shared on the Internet as a software manual."
