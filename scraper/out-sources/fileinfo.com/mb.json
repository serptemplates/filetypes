    "description": [
      "An MB file is an animation project created by Autodesk Maya, a 3D modeling and animation program. It contains binary data that defines a 3D scene's geometry, lighting, animation, and rendering. Maya projects can be saved as either MB or .MA files. MA files save a project's information in an ASCII text format."

      "Autodesk Maya is a program that animators use to create animated 3D scenes for use in films, television shows, and video games. Maya scenes are saved as MB or MA files. MB files are saved in Maya's mayaBinary format. In contrast, MA files are saved in the mayaASCII format.",
      "The primary advantage MB files have over MA files is that they are much smaller files. For example, a scene saved as an MB file may take up only half as much disk space as the same scene saved as an MA file. However, users cannot open, review, and edit MB files in text editors, as they can MA files.",
      "NOTE: Maya was originally developed by Alias Wavefront. Autodesk acquired Alias Wavefront in 2006."
