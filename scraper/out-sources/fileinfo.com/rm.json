      "An RM file is a multimedia file saved in the RealMedia multimedia container format developed by RealNetworks. It may store only audio in the RealAudio format, only video in the RealVideo format, or both RealAudio and RealVideo. RM files are commonly used for streaming content over the Internet such as video and Internet radio."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "RM multimedia content is streamed in constant bitrate, which means the bitrate remains the same during streaming. This is not optimal when streaming more complex segments of media data since the rate of data transfer remains constant. RealNetworks replaced the RM format with the RealMedia Variable Bitrate (RMVB) format, which enables media to be streamed in a variable bit rate, which allows data transfer at different speeds. This is useful in situations when the data transfer needs to be increased for more complex segments of media files.",
      "RM files that only store audio may be saved as RealAudio .RA files. Also, RM files that store audio and video, or only video, may be saved as RealVideo .RV files.",
      "NOTE: RM files may contain a URL link to a streaming media file instead of the actual audio or video data. These RM files are played back as they are downloaded.",
      "Users typically play RM media files with RealPlayer software but they may also open them with a variety of other audio programs, such as Eltima Elmedia Player or GRETECH GOM Player. VideoLAN VLC media player may also be used to play RM files but the software only provides partial support for the format. Users can also transfer RM files to RCA MP3 players to play them.",
      "There are numerous programs available to convert RM media files to other, more common formats. Some options in Windows include Applian Replay Converter and Xilisoft Video Converter Ultimate. Aiseesoft Mac Video Converter Ultimate can be used in macOS."
