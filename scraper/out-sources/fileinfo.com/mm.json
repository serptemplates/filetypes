      "An MM file contains a \"mind map,\" which is a visual diagram that consists of text, nodes, branches, shapes, and icons that represent ideas. It may be created by a variety of \"mind-mapping\" programs, such as FreeMind and Freeplane. MM files are often used for organizing ideas when brainstorming, researching topics, tracking projects, and taking notes."

      "When you create a map in FreeMind the MM file is created to store its contents. You can reopen the file to edit its contents or you can export the file to other formats such as .HTML, .XHTML, .PNG, .JPEG, .PDF, and .SVG.",
      "FreeMind is designed to help you visually organize ideas. You can create maps that consist of ideas placed in nodes that can be connected to other nodes and images. FreeMind is an open source program and is available as a free download."
