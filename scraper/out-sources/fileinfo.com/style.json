      "A STYLE file contains a style a user can apply to a drawing created with Trimble SketchUp, a 3D modeling program. Style examples include wavy pencil lines, graphite stick marks, and quick pen strokes. STYLE files come with the SketchUp installation, but users may also create custom styles with the Style Builder utility and share them with others."
