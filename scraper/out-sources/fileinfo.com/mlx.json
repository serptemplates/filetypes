      "An MLX file contains a live script or function in the MATLAB Live Code format, which includes MATLAB code, embedded output, equations, images, and formatted text. The MathWorks MATLAB, an application for mathematical computations and data analysis, creates and opens MLX files. MATLAB users save live scripts and functions as MLX files to create interactive documents by combining commands and their output with graphics and formatted text."

      "MATLAB provides many tools to analyze data, develop algorithms, create models, build apps, and more. One feature is Live Code, which allows users, such as engineers and scientists, to build interactive documents, such as graphs for visualizing fluid temperature data throughout a day, or a tool for calculating heart rate from electrocardiogram data.",
      "Additionally, The MathWorks introduced MLX files to extend .M source code files. Some of their differences:",
      "MLX files are saved in the Live Code format, an extension of the Zip format that stores content in separate .XML files. M files store plain text.",
      "MLX files are interoperable across different locales, whereas characters in M files are not compatible across all locales.",
      "MLX files are backward and forward compatible.",
