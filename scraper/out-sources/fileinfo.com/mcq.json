      "McAfee VirusScan allows users to scan their computers' files for viruses. It is available as a standalone product and included in several McAfee computer security bundles, including McAfee LiveSafe, McAfee AntiVirus Plus, and McAfee Total Protection.",
      "When VirusScan detects an infected file (or a file it believes is infected), it first attempts to \"clean\" the file and remove the virus. If it cannot remove the virus, it allows the user to either delete or quarantine the file. If a user chooses to quarantine the file, VirusScan encrypts the file, moves it to a secure folder, and renames it to use the .mcq extension.",
      "Users can review their list of quarantined files in McAfee VirusScan. If a user determines a quarantined file is not infected, they can use VirusScan to restore the file. Otherwise, they can permanently delete the file."
