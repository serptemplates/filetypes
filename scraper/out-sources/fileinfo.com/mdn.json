      "An MDN file is a blank template created by Microsoft Access to replicate the structure of a database. It contains information about a database structure, including tables, forms, and queries, but does not include any actual database data. Blank database templates stored in MDN files allow Access users to set up the framework of a database from a clean slate they can reproduce to tailor it to specific tasks or projects handling different types of data."
