      "You can open GED files with a variety of genealogy applications, including RootsMagic (Windows, Mac), Ancestral Author (Windows, Mac), MyHeritage Family Tree Builder (Windows, Mac), and GeneWeb (cross-platform). You can also upload GEDCOM files to Ancestry.com and FamilySearch.org (Web).",
      "Since GED files are saved in a text format, you can also open the files with a plain text editor, such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows) or Apple TextEdit (macOS), and edit them. Keep in mind that opening GED files with a text editor will not display the information in the same structure as if they were displayed in a genealogical application."
