      "A DNL file is an eBook created and used by DNAML desktop publishing and eReader software. It contains text, images, and navigation information saved in a bundled, compact format. DNL files are copy-protected using Digital Rights Management (DRM), so only authorized users and programs can open them."

      "In the past, authors and publishers used DNAML DeskTop Author to create copy-protected eBooks (and other digital publications), which could be opened only by authorized users with DNL Reader. These eBooks were saved as DNL files.",
      "While most DNL files contain eBooks, some instead contain digital catalogs, presentations, cards, brochures, or photo albums. In some cases, authors and publishers packaged DNL files with DNL Reader in standalone Windows executable (.EXE) files, which users could simply double-click to read the publication the DNL file contained."

If you still have access to these programs, you can use them to open your DNL file and view the publication it contains. Otherwise, you likely will not be able to open your DNL file."
