      "An XAERO file contains map data for Xaero's World Map, a popular Minecraft mod that adds a detailed minimap and world map to the game. It stores information about a map, including the areas of the Minecraft world the player has explored. XAERO files correspond to specific regions or chunks of the world, capturing terrain details and visual data, such as terrain layout, biome types, and structures, that appear in the mod's map interface."

    "content": [
      "Xaero's World Map is a Minecraft mod that adds a self-writing, full-screen map to the game, allowing players to view and navigate explored areas more effectively. As players move through the Minecraft world, Xaero's mod continuously creates or updates XAERO files (the files act as local map caches) to reflect newly explored areas. Additionally, the mod saves XAERO files locally in the player's Minecraft directory, usually within the mod's configuration or data folder (e.g., XaeroWorldMap/​)."
