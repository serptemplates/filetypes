      "A HA file is a compressed archive created by HA (also known as HArc), an archive utility for MS-DOS and Unix. It contains one or more files that have likely been compressed using ASC compression. HA files are uncommon, as HA is no longer commonly used."

      "Developer Harri Hirvola created the HA compression utility in 1993. It allows users to store files in HA archives. Typically, the files these archives contain are compressed using ASC or HSC compression.",
      "Each HA file contains a header that starts with HA, to identify it as a HA archive. The header then states the number of files the archive contains.",
      "During the archiving process, HA also appends a header to each file it places in an archive. This header states the file's original size, compressed size, filename, and version of HA used to compress it."
