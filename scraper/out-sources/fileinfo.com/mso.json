      "An MSO file is a macro reference file created when saving a Microsoft Office document as a webpage. It contains information about macros and OLE (Object Linking and Embedding) objects included in the original file and may be referenced by the created webpage as a style sheet. MSO files may be viewed with a text editor, but will be unreadable since the contents are encoded."
