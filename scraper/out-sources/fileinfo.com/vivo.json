      "A VIVO file is a video file associated with VivoActive, an early, now-discontinued streaming media technology used in the 1990s. It contains H.263-compressed video data and G.723 ADPCM-compressed audio data in the VivoActive (VIVO) format. VIVO files may store various types of video but most often contain adult video content."

      "Vivo Software developed the VIVO format to deliver compressed video over slow Internet connections. The technology enabled streaming content on dial-up networks, a common issue in the 1990s.",
      "In 1997, RealNetworks acquired Vivo Software, and integrated some of its streaming technologies into RealPlayer. After the acquisition, RealNetworks discontinued the VIVO format, and newer streaming formats like RealVideo and other modern codecs replaced it."
