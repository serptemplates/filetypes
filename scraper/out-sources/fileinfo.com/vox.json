      "The Voxlap engine was created by Ken Silverman and is available freely. It has been used for creating games such as Ace of Spades, which uses .KV6 files that are based on the VOX format.",
      "NOTE: A voxel (which stands for \"volumetric pixel\") is a pixel represented as a cube in 3D space. Therefore, voxel models look like they have been built with LEGO blocks when rendered. The Voxlap VOX format is one of many different voxel formats."
