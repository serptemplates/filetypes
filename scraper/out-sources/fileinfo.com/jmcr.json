      "The JMCR file is similar to the .JMCE file format as it is created using additional JM-Crypt \"Exchange\" encryption. This method uses encrypted asymmetric key pairs (one public and one private). It also uses an auto-generated password and instant selfie or a random key generated for symmetric encryption and electronic ID card certificate for a signature. The random key is created by JM-Crypt Security's homemade fast Fourier transform (FFT) key generator.",
      "The JMCR file is used to encrypt confidential personal files and sensitive business files. JM-Crypt also uses the .JMC, .JMCX, .JMCK, .JMCP files for encrypting files.",
      "NOTE: In order to decrypt the JMCR file, you need the JM-Crypt software and algorithm that were used to originally encrypt the file."
