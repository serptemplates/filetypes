      "A JQ3SAVEGAME file is a saved game file created by Jewel Quest III, a tile-matching puzzle video game published by iWin. It contains a record of a player's progress in Jewel Quest III. JQ3SAVEGAME files cannot be used to migrate saved Jewel Quest III games from one computer to another."

      "Jewel Quest is a series of tile-matching games available for Windows, macOS, and mobile devices. On Windows, Jewel Quest III saves users' game progress in JQ3SAVEGAME files, which are located in the C:/​Users/​YourUserName/​Saved Games/​iWin/​Jewel Quest 3/​YourUserName directory.",
      "However, those looking to use their JQ3SAVEGAME file to transfer a saved Jewel Quest III game from one computer to another will be disappointed. Because Jewel Quest III forces players to create a new account each time they launch the game on a new PC, and JQ3SAVEGAME files are tied to specific Jewel Quest III accounts, transferring a JQ3SAVEGAME file to a new PC will not cause your previously saved game to appear in Jewel Quest III."
