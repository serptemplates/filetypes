      "You can open, edit, save, and convert PPSX files with Microsoft PowerPoint in Windows and macOS. PowerPoint is the best option for opening PPSX files because the software fully supports the formatting of the slide show, which includes the placement of text and images. The application is also available for Android and iOS devices.",
      "Several other presentation programs can open PPSX files but they may not fully support the formatting of the slide show files. Alternative programs include Kingsoft Presentation (multiplatform), Apache OpenOffice Impress (multiplatform), Ability Office (Windows), and Apple Keynote (Mac). If you are a Mac user simply looking to view a PPSX file, you can use Apple Preview, which comes bundled with macOS.",
      "You can also open PPSX files with Google Slides, which is a free web and mobile application you can access with a Google account. The web tool allows you to open, edit, save, and convert the slide show."
