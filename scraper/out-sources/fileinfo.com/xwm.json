      "An XWM file is an audio file used by XAudio2, a low-level audio API used in Windows- or Xbox-based video games. It contains music or other audio played in a game. XWM files are used in The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim - Special Edition and Castle Crashers, among other games."

      "xWMA is an audio codec Microsoft provides to video game developers, so they can create audio files that work with Microsoft's XAudio2 API. XAudio2 provides a signal processing and mixing foundation for video games, allowing developers to add high-quality sound effects and background music to their games. Most times, files saved using the xWMA codec are saved using the .xwm file extension, though they may also be saved using the .XWMA extension.",
      "XWM files are very similar to .WAV, .WMA, and .XMA files, which are also saved using Microsoft-developed codecs. XWM files, however, are used only in video games. As such, you likely will not encounter an XWM file unless you attempt to extract audio files from a Windows- or Xbox-based video game."

      "Because XWM files are uncommon, most popular media players cannot play them. However, you can open and play an XWM file in VLC media player, and you can convert it to a more usable audio format using FFmpeg."
