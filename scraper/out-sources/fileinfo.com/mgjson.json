      "After Effects is a Windows and macOS application used to enhance video projects, such as Adobe Premiere Pro video projects (.PRPROJ files), with motion graphics. Video editors often use the software in post-production to enhance films, television shows, and video games.",
      "The software supports various formats, including MGJSON, .JSON, .CSV, and .TSV, to input data into compositions to control motion graphics (known as data-driven animation). The MGJSON format is similar to a standard JSON file but also supports dynamic data instead of only static data values. Data in an MGJSON file may be generated from many types of sources, including websites, fitness trackers, or static user-entered data."
