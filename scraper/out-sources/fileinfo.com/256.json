      "A 256 file is a color palette file used by Descent 2, a first-person shooter in which players pilot a spaceship to destroy mines infected by a computer virus. It contains a list of RGB values that describe colors used by the textures stored in an associated .PIG file. 256 files use the same name as their associated PIG file."

The game also contains 256 files, which correspond to a specific PIG file and describe the color palette that file's textures use. Many of the game's PIG and 256 files are stored in its .HOG mission files."
