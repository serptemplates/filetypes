      "A CHR file is a game file used by Doki Doki Literature Club!, a visual Anime novel for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It stores \"Easter egg\" information that is referenced by the game. The name of the file, which may be monika.chr, natsuki.chr, sayori.chr, or yuri.chr (characters in the game) indicates the Easter egg content stored in the file."

      "You will most likely only come across the Doki Doki Literature Club! CHR files if you have installed the visual novel. The CHR files are located in the \"characters\" folder in the game folder.",
      "The game does not actually open the various CHR files stored in the \"characters\" folder. Instead, it checks if the files are present, which triggers specific events in the visual novel.",
      "Each CHR file stores different information and can be opened with a program that supports the information contained in the file. For example, the monika.chr file is actually a .PNG file that can be opened with an image editor that supports PNG files."
