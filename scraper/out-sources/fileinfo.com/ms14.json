      "An MS14 file is a CAD file created with version 14 of Multisim, a program used to design, prototype, and test printed circuits. It contains a circuit schematic design, which may include diodes, components connectors, indicators, and peripherals."

      "MS14 files are one of the primary file types associated with Multisim. You can create an MS14 file by selecting File → New..., choosing the design type, then selecting File → Save. You can open an MS14 file by simply double-clicking the MS14 file or selecting File → Open....",
      "Multisim appends a number to circuit design file extensions, which indicates the version of Multisim that created the design. For example, Multisim 12 uses the .MS12 file extension and Multisim 13 uses the .MS13 file extension for saving designs. Also, Multisim supports older project formats, which means that version 14 of Multisim can open an .MS9 design created by version 9 of Multisim.",
