      "A SNIBB file is an audio module created by Snibbetracker, a music tracker developed for creating and playing digital music. It contains the patterns, notes, instrument data, volume levels, and timing information that make up a music composition created in Snibbetracker. SNIBB files allow musicians to build detailed, sample-based music that can be played back using the same samples and settings every time."

      "Harry Lundström developed Snibbetracker, a simple music sequencer for Windows and macOS, that allows users to arrange musical patterns and samples in a grid-like interface. Hobbyist musicians, retro computing enthusiasts, and digital music creators working with Snibbetracker are the most likely to encounter SNIBB files. When composing, they can save their progress as a SNIBB module by pressing the control + s keys."
