      "RetroForth is a programming language that takes inspiration from the original Forth language, which was released in 1970. Like Forth, RetroForth is a procedural, stack-based language. While RetroForth incorporates elements of Forth, it also utilizes elements of the colorForth, cmForth, Joy, Factor, and Parable programming languages.",
      "Developers who are developing programs written in RetroForth save those programs' source code files as RETRO files. After a developer finishes creating a program, they can use the RetroForth compiler and their RETRO file to execute that program."
