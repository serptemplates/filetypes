      "A DAE file is a 3D interchange file used for exchanging digital assets between a variety of graphics programs. It may contain an image, textures, or most likely, a 3D model. The DAE format is based on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema, which is now owned and developed by Autodesk."

  "technical_info": {
    "content": [
      "The COLLADA format was originally developed by Sony and is now jointly supported by Sony and the Khronos Group. It was designed to provide a standard schema that 3D graphics applications could use to save files, so those files could easily be exchanged among applications."

  "how_to_open": {
    "instructions": [
      "You can open DAE files and view their contents in Adobe Photoshop (Windows, Mac) and Apple Preview (Mac). If you want to edit a DAE file, you should open it in an Autodesk application that supports DAE files, such as Autodesk Maya (cross-platform), or Blender (cross-platform).",
      "You can also import DAE files into many applications for use as 3D assets. For example, the ArcGIS suite (Windows) allows users to import and use DAE format assets."
