      "GnuPG is a free alternative to Symantec's Pretty Good Privacy (PGP) software. It allows users to encrypt and decrypt emails, texts, directories, and other files. When encrypting and decrypting files, GnPG uses a variety of public and private security keys. A user's public keys are saved in a KBX file.",
      "Typically, a user's KBX file is named pubring.kbx and stored in their .gnupg directory. Users can import a KBX file into other OpenPGP-compliant software, such as OpePGP.js, to use the public keys and certificates it contains with that software."
