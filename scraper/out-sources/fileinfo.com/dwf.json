    "description": [
      "A DWF file is a 2D or 3D drawing saved in the Design Web Format (DWF) developed by Autodesk. It contains design data, which includes graphics and text. DWF files are saved in a Zip-compressed format to reduce their file size."

    "content": [
      "The Design Web Format was developed as a device-independent and resolution-independent drawing format for distributing designs. It is not intended to replace popular CAD formats, but instead, is used to save designs in a more accessible, open format that can be opened without the need to purchase expensive CAD software. The format is based on the HOOPS Stream (HSF) 2D/3D format but is also Zip-compressed.",
      "DWF files can include one or many design sheets. Because the files are highly-compressed, they're easy for engineers and designers to share over the Internet (thus the name Design Web Format)."

      "You can open a DWF file in many CAD applications, including Autodesk Design Review (Windows), IMSI TurboCAD (Windows, Mac), and CorelCAD (Windows, Mac). Note that you cannot open a DWF file in the desktop versions of Autodesk AutoCAD, though you can attach the file inside an AutoCAD drawing using the XREF or DWFATTACH commands."
