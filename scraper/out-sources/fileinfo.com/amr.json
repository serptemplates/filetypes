      "AMR files incorporate the Algebraic Code Excited Linear Prediction (ACELP) algorithm, designed to compress human speech audio efficiently. Additionally, the files may be saved in the AMR-NB (Narrowband) or AMR-WB (Wideband) format. Wideband audio supports a broader frequency range, providing better sound quality."
