      "The POD HD500 guitar pedal is a device that electric guitarists use to modify their instruments' sound. POD HD500 Edit is a desktop PC program that allows guitarists to create and organize presets for the POD HD500 pedal.",
      "One way guitarists can organize presets is by grouping them within a set list. Each set list typically contains presets for a particular performance, listed in the order in which the guitarist intends to use them during that performance. This allows the guitarist to quickly advance through the set list's presets while performing.",
