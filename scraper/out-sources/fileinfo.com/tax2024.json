      "A TAX2024 file is a tax return file created by the 2024 version of Intuit TurboTax, a software application for preparing and filing U.S. Federal and State tax returns. It stores tax information for the 2024 tax year, including Federal IRS forms, State tax forms (if applicable), and user-provided personal and financial data.

      "The desktop version of TurboTax 2024 allows you to save your preparation progress as TAX2024 files (File → Save...). All four editions (Basic, Deluxe, Premier, and Home & Business) support TAX2024 files. When saving your file, you can also secure it with password protection.",
      "TurboTax Online can also export tax returns as TAX2024 files. You might do this if you started preparing your taxes with the web version but want to complete them with the desktop version of TurboTax. You might also want to export them for archival purposes. You can download a TAX2024 file from the web version by clicking Tax Tools → Tools and selecting Save your 2024 return to your computer.",
      "NOTE: If you modify your tax return in TurboTax Online after downloading the TAX2024 file, the software does not add those changes to the file since it does not sync them. To update the file with changes, you must export the TAX2024 tax return again."
