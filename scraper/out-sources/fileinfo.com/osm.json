      "Planet.osm contains a lot of data, so it is an incredibly large file. Users who want to work with smaller sections of planet.osm's data can do so by exporting only that portion of the file from OpenStreetMap.org. For example, a user who wants to export a map of their city can zoom in on their city in OpenStreetMap.org and select Export. OpenStreetMap.org will then produce a map.osm file that contains the map shown on the user's screen. Users can also download more targeted OSM files from supporting FTP sites, which are linked from OpenStreetMap.org."
