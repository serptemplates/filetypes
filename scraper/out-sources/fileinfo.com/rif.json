      "An RIF file is a raster image created by Corel Painter, a program used for digital painting. It contains an image with various Painter elements, including brushstrokes, pencil sketches, and image hose graphics. RIF files may also bear the less common .RIFF file extension."

      "Casual and professional artists use Corel Painter to create digital paintings. The program includes several different types of brushes, canvases, and drawing tools, and it also integrates with pen displays and drawing tablets for freehand drawing.",
      "Painter primarily saves users' drawing and image editing projects as RIF files. RIF files retain all project information, typically making them larger than standard raster image formats, such as .GIF or .JPG files. Also, RIF files are saved separately from the canvas, allowing artists to experiment with different textures later.",
