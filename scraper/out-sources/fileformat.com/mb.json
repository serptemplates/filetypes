      "A file with .mb extension is a binary project file created with Autodesk Maya application. Unlike the MA file format, which is in ASCII file format, MB files are stored in binary file format. These can not be opened in text editors but can be examined in Hex Editors. MB files contain information such as geometry, lighting, animation, and rendering for defining the 3D scenes.\n\nAutodesk Maya 2020 can be used to open .mb files."
