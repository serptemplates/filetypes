      "An AGP file is a 32-bit image file with multiple layers. It is created with the ArtGem software that provides the features of working with images and is similar to Adobe Photoshop in basic features. AGP is a project file that contains all the settings for creating the final image.\n\nAGP files could be opened with RL Vision ArtGem. However, ArtGem has long been discontinued after getting sold."
