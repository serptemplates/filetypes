      "A DER file is a digital certificate file that is created and stored in binary format. It is a binary encoding for the X.509 certificates and private keys. In contrast to PEM files (CRT, CER), DER files do not contain human-readable plain text statements such as —–BEGIN CERTIFICATE—–. They are mostly used in context of Java."
