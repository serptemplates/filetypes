      "A “.PAT” file, short for “Pattern File” is specific file format used in various graphics and design software. These files typically contain information about pattern or texture that can be applied to elements within design or illustration. The pattern information may include the arrangement of pixels, colors and other details required to create repeating pattern.\n\nThese “.PAT” files are commonly used in software like Adobe Photoshop to apply custom patterns to shapes, backgrounds or other elements in design, allowing designers to easily replicate and use complex or custom patterns in their projects without having to recreate them manually.\n\nThese patterns are often square in shape and range in size from 8x8 pixels to 256x256 pixels. They are designed to seamlessly repeat when applied allowing them to cover a larger area with same pattern, are particularly useful for enhancing digital designs commonly employed to create textured backgrounds or to add visual interest to various elements in graphics projects."
