      "The DSS file, which stands for Digital Speech Standard, is a proprietary digital audio format originally established by the International Voice Association, a joint venture founded by industry leaders Philips, Olympus, and Grundig Business Systems. As an older codec specifically engineered for speech, its primary design goal was efficiency rather than high-fidelity music reproduction. The format compresses voice audio data to enable fundamental recording functions like playback and capture while maintaining a very compact file size. This focus on efficiency inherently results in audio quality that is lower than that of more general-purpose formats like MP3, a deliberate trade-off to achieve its core objective of minimizing storage requirements for extended voice recordings."
