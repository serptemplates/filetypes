      "An APPCACHE file is a text file that contains the list of resources to be cached by browsers for offline access to the web applications. This is useful when there is no internet connection. In such situation, the browser uses the offline cache resources to provide access to the web contents. APPCACHE file contains web resources such as images (for example PNG, WEBP, etc.), stylesheets ([CSS])(/web/css/), and script files (such as Javascript JS files).\n\nApplications that can open APPCACHE files include web browsers such as Google Chrome, Safari, and Firefox."
