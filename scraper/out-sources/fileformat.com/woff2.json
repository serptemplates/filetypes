      "WOFF2 is a font file format that is a more compressed version of the Web Open Font Format (WOFF). It was developed as a way to reduce the file size of web fonts, allowing them to load faster and use less bandwidth. WOFF2 uses a compression algorithm called Brotli to compress the font data, which can result in file sizes that are significantly smaller than equivalent WOFF fonts. This format is supported by most modern web browsers including Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Opera and Edge (version 14 onwards)."
