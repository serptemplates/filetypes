      "PostScript (PS) is a general-purpose page description language used in the business of desktop and electronic publishing. The main focus of PostScript (PS) is to facilitate the two-dimensional graphic design. Most languages require a distinct compilation stage before the code execution while Post Script (PS) format support a runtime straight forward interpretation. Its early version defines the graphical shapes, different text appearances and modelled imageries on printed pages or displayed pages, following the rules of Adobe imaging model. A program of PS is able to intercommunicate a document description between a composition and printing system keeping the device independent and high-level. Moreover this program is also capable of governing the appearance of text and graphics on a display.\n\nPostScript page description is available to be rendered, displayed on printer and other output device with the help of the PostScript interpreter of the device. As the commands to print characters, graphical shapes and images are executed by interpreter, for that specific device, the high-level PostScript description converts into the low level raster data format. Generally, different applications such as illustrators, document composition systems and computer-aided design (CAD) are automated to generate PostScript page descriptions. Generally programmers have to write PostScript programs at the time of new applications creation. However, a programmer can take advantage of the capabilities of the PostScript language that are not accessible in any application by writing a PS a program for that special situation."
