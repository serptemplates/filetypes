      "A file with .iso extension is an uncompressed archive disk image file that represents the contents of entire data on an optical disc such as CD or DVD. Based on the ISO-9660 standard, the ISO image file format contains the disc data along with the filesystem information that is stored in it. The capability of ISO files to contain an exact replica of the content makes it the perfect file type for creating copies of CDs/DVDs and are mostly used to store bootable data for installation. Most of the times, ISO files are burnt to USB/CD/DVD as bootable content for booting the machine for installation. ISO files have MIME type application/x-iso9660-image."
