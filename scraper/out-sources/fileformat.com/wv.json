      "The code of WavPack is portable and compatible with Unix, Mac OS, and Windows. Plugins for different applications are available for WV files. It can be used on many architectures like x86 and Motorola 68k. This type of compression is compatible with most PCM formats of audio.\n\nSome of these are 8,16 and 32-bit recordings. Sometimes WVC files are included as companions with the WV files. These audio files are compatible to be used on almost all media players currently used along with the requirement of an external codec Of WavPack.\n\nThe hybrid mode in WV solves the issue of having to choose between a small file with low quality and a compressed file with high quality. Rather than creating one single file, the hybrid mode creates a high-quality file with a small size that can be easily used on its own and a combination of this with a lossy file, gives the “correction” file. This combination provides a chance to make a full restoration without loss. This hybrid mode works on about 196 kbps in the case of CD audio or 2.25 bits per sample."

      "The WV files are audio files that are compressed using WavPack Hybrid compression. Both lossless and lossy compressions are supported by WavPack. This audio format offers unparalleled functionality. WV files contain digital audios which are being compressed by WavPack Audio.\n\nThe lossless mode is perfect for archiving audio data and compression of data without any degradation and loss of a bit are abilities of Wavpack. It has an open-source library interface along with an unrestricted license. These files are mostly related to the Sonarc compressors. These WavPack compressed audio files have 30 to 70 percent of the original file size.\n\nWV supports hybrid audio compression. These compressed files are relatively small in size, higher in quality, and can be used in the same format (i.e no conversion needed to open and use ). The original WV files are the highly compressed and lossy format of an audio clip. The addition of the correct data from the WVC file can be used to restore the original audio entirely."
