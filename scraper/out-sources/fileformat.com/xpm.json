      "A file with .xpm extension is an image file format that was used by the X Windows System. It supports transparent pixels and usually targets creating icon pixmaps. It supports monochrome, gra-scale, and color pixmap data. These were designed to be editable by hand and can be included in C code. For this purpose, XPM files are in plain text file format and follow the C programming language syntax. XPM files can be opened with a variety of image viewing application such as CorelDRAW Graphics Suite 2020, Corel PaintShop Pro, IrfanView, and Canvas X."
