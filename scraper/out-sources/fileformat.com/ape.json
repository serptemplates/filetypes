      "An APE file is a type of audio file that uses the Monkey’s Audio compression algorithm, designed specifically for lossless audio data compression. Unlike popular lossy formats such as MP3, AAC, Vorbis, or Opus, this algorithm preserves every bit of the original audio data, ensuring no quality is lost during encoding. With Monkey’s Audio, file sizes are typically reduced to nearly half of their original size, making storage and transfer more efficient while maintaining high fidelity. In addition, APE files include built-in error detection and tagging support, which help maintain data integrity and store important metadata about the audio content.\n\nAPE file format is more widely used among Microsoft Windows users. It uses highly insistent compression rate and the other great thing is that the Monkey’s Audio files can be always decompressed to the exact, original files. The Monkey’s Audio encoder is freely available and can be included easily into other software programs. If Monkey’s Audio is Compared to ALAC, FLAC, or WavPack, it is relatively slow to encode or decode files."
