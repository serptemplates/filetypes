      "CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) are files that describe how HTML elements are displayed on the screen, paper, etc. With HTML, you can have either embedded styles or styles can be defined in an external stylesheet. For embedding the styles, the <style></style> tags are used. The external stylesheets are stored in files with the .css extension. With the external CSS, you can include it on multiple HTML pages to update the style of those pages. Even a single CSS file can be used to style a complete website.",
      "The latest version of CSS is CSS3, but it’s not a single version. CSS is an evolving standard with new features added in modules over time. As of now, CSS3 includes various modules like Flexbox, Grid, Animations, and more. Future updates are part of the CSS4 concept, though it’s not officially defined as a standalone version."
