      "A file with .xht extension is a web file associated with the XHTML (Extended Hypertext Markup Language) file type, which itself is an XML based markup file. Both these files are similar to HTML but have a more stringent XML-like syntax. XHT files are designed in a way to be more structured, involves less scripting, and are generic in addition to using the existing facilities of XML."
