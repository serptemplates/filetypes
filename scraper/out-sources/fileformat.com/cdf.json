      "A file with .cdf extension is an XLM based information distribution file format that was used to publish frequent updates as “channels”. The information is published from any web server and is automatically delivered to computers with compatible receiving programs such as web browsers. Users subscribe to active channels and have scheduled updates delivered to their desktop. CDF files were earlier used in conjunction with Microsoft’s Active Channel, Active Desktop and Smart Offline Favorites technologies."
