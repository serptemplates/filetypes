      "A .abx file is an address book exported from the WordPerfect Office software developed by Corel. WordPerfect was a word processing software developed by Corel Corporation and has been in use for quite some time. ABX files contained information about the contacts information extracted from the WordPerfect e-mail client. The exported contacts information can be transferred to other devices and used accordingly.",

It is now part of the Corel WordPerfect Office Suite and is popular in legal and academic fields for its advanced formatting tools. The software supports a wide range of file formats, including Microsoft Word and PDF. Its unique “Reveal Codes” feature provides precise control over document formatting."
