      "A J2K file is an image that is compressed using the wavelet compression instead of DCT compression. This file format is used by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG) 2000 files. J2K files store metadata information about the image file in XML unlike .jpeg or .jpg that use the EXIF format for this purpose. J2K files support 15-bit color, alpha transparency, and lossless compression. Several commercial APIs exist to decode JPEG 2000 imags such as J2K-Codec. A J2K file can be opened on Windows OS using the standard image viewers."
