      "A TVDB file is a type of database file that is associated with Apple TV. It’s typically stored within your TV Library, which is the file responsible for holding your Apple TV library data. TVDB files serve as repositories of information related to either your Apple TV settings or your Apple TV library contents. These files play a role in maintaining and organizing data relevant to your Apple TV setup and media library.\n\nApple TV devices typically interact with various online databases and services to provide users with access to content, such as movies, TV shows, music, and apps. These databases and services are maintained by Apple and are used to organize and deliver content to Apple TV users. However, the internal structure and file format of these databases are not typically exposed to users, and there’s no standard file format known as “Apple TV Database.”"
