      "A file with .oar extension is an archive file used by the OpenSimulator application which is an open-source 3D application server for creating a virtual environment accessible to multi-users over the network. The OAR file format provides necessary asset data required to fully load the terrain, object textures, and inventories on a different system. OpenSimulator also has optional hypergrid that allows users to visit other OpenSimulator installations across the web.
