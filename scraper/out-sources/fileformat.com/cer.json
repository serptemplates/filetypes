The specifically secured certificate authorities are those which belong to HTTPS, a trusted and secured protocol for browsingThe CER is a certificate of your server. It is usually received by the certificate authority for the domain. CER is mostly considered the same as CRT, although both are the same format of SSL certificate but are different filename extensions.
