      "A GNE file is a webpage that is dynamically generated and used by the Flickr photo-sharing website. The pages are hosted on the server from where these are served to the requesting user’s browser. GNE files are similar to PHP and ASP pages, but are developed in a proprietary programming language whose details are not available for developer’s reference."
