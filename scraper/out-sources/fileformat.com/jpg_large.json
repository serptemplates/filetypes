      "The .jpg_large file format is specific to Twitter and refers to a larger version of a JPEG image file. When users upload images to Twitter, they often get processed and resized for optimization across various devices and views. A jpg_large image typically retains higher resolution than the standard version displayed in a tweet. Twitter appends the _large suffix to the filename to indicate it’s a larger, higher-quality JPEG.\n\nIf you download a .jpg_large file, you can rename it to .jpg without losing the image data. The “large” suffix is simply a naming convention used by Twitter and does not represent a different file format.",
      "Twitter is a social media platform where users post and interact through short messages called “tweets,” limited to 280 characters. Founded in 2006, it allows individuals, organizations, and celebrities to share updates, opinions, and multimedia content in real time. Twitter’s timeline format promotes fast-paced conversations, trends, and viral content through hashtags. Users can follow others to curate their feeds. It’s widely used for news, entertainment, activism, and public discourse, making it a hub for global communication."

Right-click the file, select “Rename,” and remove the _large part, so it ends with .jpg.
