      "A 3GPP file is a multimedia file format used for storing audio and video content on mobile devices particularly in 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) compliant devices. The 3GPP is a collaboration between various telecommunications standards organizations that develops and maintains standards for mobile communication systems.\n\nThe 3GPP file format is based on MPEG-4 Part 14 container format, commonly known as MP4. It supports storage of audio, video and other media types including text and images. The file extension for 3GPP files is typically “.3gp” or “.3g2” for 3GPP2 files.\n\nThese files are often used to store content recorded on mobile devices such as videos captured using a smartphone’s camera. They can be played back on compatible devices or converted to other more widely supported video formats using various software tools or online converters.",
      "The format of 3GPP file is based on MPEG-4 Part 14 container format, commonly known as MP4. The MP4 format is a widely used multimedia container that can hold various types of audio, video, text and image data. It is a standardized format developed by International Organization for Standardization (ISO).\n\nThe MP4 format is designed to be compatible with wide range of devices and platforms including mobile devices, computers and media players. It offers efficient compression while maintaining good quality, making it suitable for storing and streaming multimedia content.\n\nThe 3GPP file format, based on MP4, extends capabilities of container format to specifically cater to the requirements and standards set by 3rd Generation Partnership Project (3GPP).\n\nIn short, the 3GPP file format follows MP4 container format, allowing for storage of audio, video, text and image data in a standardized and widely supported format.",
