      "An FOT file is a font file used for font outline data files. It contains information about the overall shapes and outlines of the characters in a font. Other information contained in a .fot file includes font’s name, style and its size. FOT files are used by applications that support TrueType (.TTF files). It is more often used by application installers during installation of fonts."
