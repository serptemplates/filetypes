      "A file with .fon extension is a Microsoft Windows 3.x font library that is actually an executable file but renamed to .fon. It is a collection of .fnt files in itself and applications reference it while accessing system font. That is why it acts as a resource file. It can be opened on Windows OS using Microsoft Windows Font View application."
