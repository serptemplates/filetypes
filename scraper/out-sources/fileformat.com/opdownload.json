      "An Opera Partially Downloaded File is a file that has been partially downloaded using the Opera web browser. Opera saves files as they download, and if a download is interrupted or paused, the partially downloaded file is saved with an “opdownload” extension. When a download is complete, the “.opdownload” extension is removed, and the file becomes usable. However, if the download is interrupted or incomplete, the “.opdownload” extension remains, and the file is unusable until the download is resumed or completed. To resume a partially downloaded file in Opera, simply click on the “Resume” button that appears next to the file in the download manager. If the download cannot be resumed, you may need to restart the download from scratch."

      "An OPDOWNLOAD file is usually an incomplete download file created by the Opera web browser. When you download a file in Opera, it creates an OPDOWNLOAD file and once the download is complete, it renames the file to its original format. Therefore, it is not possible to convert an OPDOWNLOAD file to MP4 or ZIP, as it is not a valid file format. You need to wait until the download is complete and the file is renamed to its original format before you can convert it to MP4 or ZIP. If you are unable to complete the download or the file is corrupt, you may need to restart the download or try downloading the file from a different source."
