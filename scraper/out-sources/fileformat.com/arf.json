      "An ARF (Advanced Recording File) file is a Network-Based Recording (NBR) file created from an online meeting conducted via WebEx. It contains higher quality video and audio, and is the widely used file format in WebEx meetings. Information contained in an ARF file includes video data, table of contents, attendee list, desktop recording, application sharing, and other meeting content. ARF files can not be directed edited, but start and end of playback can be truncated. ARF is the default file format used by WebEx meetings."
