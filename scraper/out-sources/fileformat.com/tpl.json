      "A file with .tpl extension is a template file created and used by HTTP File Server (HFS) which is a file sharing application program to send and receive files over the web technology HTTP instead of the FTP protocol. It is used to build HTML pages dynamically based on the template information that is defined to have settings with similar layout, styling and scripts. Applications that require the same settings can be assigned the same template file and HFS will return the requested page dynamically on runtime based on this template file."
