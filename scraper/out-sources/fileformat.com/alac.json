      "The Apple Lossless Audio Codec, commonly known as ALAC, is a high-efficiency audio format that utilizes the MPEG-4 compliant QuickTime container (.m4a). Initially launched as a proprietary technology in 2004, Apple transitioned ALAC to an open-source and royalty-free model in 2011, significantly broadening its accessibility. This format provides a perceptible audio upgrade over lossy codecs like AAC and MP3 by preserving all the original data. While functionally similar to FLAC (Free Lossless Audio Codec), ALAC typically achieves a slightly different compression ratio. For playback, ALAC-encoded files are natively supported on Apple devices through QuickTime and iTunes (now Apple Music), and can be played on Microsoft Windows Media Player with the addition of the K-Lite codec pack."
