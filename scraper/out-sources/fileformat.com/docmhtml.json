      "A DOCMHTML file is an old variant of web archive saved by the earlier versions of Microsoft Word. It is no more supported by the latest version of Microsoft Word. A DOCMHTML file contains HTML representation of the original .doc word document. It can be opened in Microsoft Word as well as in web browser. When a DOCMHTML is published, it can be hosted on a web server that is accessible to users via web request. Another similar format is DOCHTML that has also been discontinued."
