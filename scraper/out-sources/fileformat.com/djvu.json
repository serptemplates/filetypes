      "DjVu, pronounced as “déjà vu”, is a graphics file format intended for scanned documents and books especially those which contain the combination of text, drawings, images and photographs. It was developed by AT&T Labs. It uses multiple techniques like image layer separation of text and background images, progressive loading, arithmetic coding and lossy compression for bitonal images. Since DJVU file can contain compressed yet high-quality colour images, photographs, text, and drawings and can be saved in less space therefore, it’s used on web as eBooks, manuals, newspapers, ancient documents, etc.\n\nDjVu can be graded superior alternative to PDF. File extensions associated to DjVu are .DJVU or .DJV. DjVu can achieve compression ratios about 5 – 10 better than existing methods such as JPEG & GIF for colour documents and 3 – 8 times better than TIFF in black and white documents. Scanned documents at 300 DPI with full colour upto 25 MB can be compressed down to 30 to 100 KB. Similarly Black and white documents can be compressed upto 5 to 30 KB. Average HTML page can be up to 50 KB, therefore, these documents can be uploaded on net without any problem."
