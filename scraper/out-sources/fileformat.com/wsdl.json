      "A WSDL file is a Web Services Description Language file that is written in XML language for describing Web services. It contains information about the endpoints or interfaces for connectivity to the outside world in a universally accepted format. WSDL file format specifications (maintained by W3C.org) define the terms for publishing data feeds for exchange of data in order to have remote application access over ports and endpoints."
