      "A PVT file is a type of Live Photo, a combination of pictures and videos created by an iPhone. Usually, Live Photos have a different name like .HEIC, but sometimes when you share them using services like AirDrop, they might end up with a .pvt extension by mistake. Normally, when you send a Live Photo, it should be in .HEIC format (or changed to .JPG in some cases). For instance, if you AirDrop it to a Mac, it should show up as an HEIC file. But occasionally, it might turn into a PVT file."
