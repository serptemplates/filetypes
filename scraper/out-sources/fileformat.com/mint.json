      "A MINT file is an installation package file used by the Linux Mint distribution. It contains compressed source code files that are extracted and used to start the Linux Mint OS installation. Linux Mint OS has easy to use GUI (Graphical User Interface) and was the first one to have an elegant GUI design. MINT files are decompressed and stored in a temporary directory along with the installer package. The installation is executed from the same directory for installation of Linux Mint OS."
