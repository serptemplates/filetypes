      "WAV, short for Waveform Audio File Format, is a subset of Microsoft’s Resource Interchange File Format (RIFF) used for storing high-quality digital audio. Unlike compressed formats, WAV files store audio data without any compression, preserving full sound fidelity across various sampling rates and bitrates. This format has long been a standard for audio CDs due to its superior sound quality. Although WAV files are larger compared to modern formats like MP3, which uses lossy compression to reduce file size, WAV files can still be compressed using Audio Compression Manager (ACM) codecs. Additionally, numerous APIs and applications are available to easily convert WAV files into other popular audio formats, such as MP3, AAC, or FLAC.\n\nDid you know?
