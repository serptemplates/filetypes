      "The .mscz file format is the proprietary and default project file for MuseScore, the widely-used open-source music notation software. As the core file type for this powerful application, MuseScore relies on the .mscz extension to save and store musical compositions in their entirety. This comprehensive container holds every detail of a score, encapsulating all musical notations, symbols, and layout settings for a specific piece. Within a single .mscz file, you’ll find everything from the fundamental notes and rhythms to critical expressive markings like dynamics, tempo, key signatures, and a wide array of other essential musical elements, providing a complete digital representation of a composition.\n\nBy saving composition in .mscz format, you can preserve the entire structure and layout of music piece, making it possible to open and edit the composition in MuseScore or other software that supports this file format.",
      "The .mscz file format used by MuseScore is a binary file format. It is not human-readable and is designed to store various elements of musical composition in a structured and efficient manner.\n\nThe specific details of .mscz file format are proprietary to MuseScore and exact internal structure and organization of the file may change between different versions of MuseScore. This means that only MuseScore and other compatible software can reliably interpret and work with .mscz files."
