      "A file with .sdf extension contains the Microsoft SQL Server Compact (SQL CE) database which is also known as a compact relational database; produced by Microsoft for the applications made for mobile devices and desktops. It supports both 32 and 64 bits operating system and the complete content of database is included in a single SDF file and can occupy more than 4GB disk space. For the security purpose, a .sdf file can be encrypted with 128-bit encryption. The SQL CE runtime settles parallel multi-user access to the .sdf file. The SDF file can be copied via QuickOnce or simply it can be copied to destination for system deployment."
