      "A KINE file is a project file used by the KineMaster video editing software. It contains all the information about the edited video, such as the timeline, media files used, effects applied, and audio tracks. The KINE file is used to save the progress of a video project and can be opened later to continue editing. The KineMaster software is widely used for creating and editing videos on mobile devices."
