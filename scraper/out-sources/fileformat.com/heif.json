      "An HEIF file is a High-Efficiency Container Image file format that is capable of storing a single image or a sequence of images in a single file. It, thus, is basically a container having multiple images stored. HEIF file format compresses the images using the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard. It is is more efficient and light weight as compared other image file formats such as JPEG. A single HEIF file can store sequences of images such as GIF animations or HDR sequence, along with metadata that describes each image. Apple Inc. adopted its variant HEIC file format for their iOS 11. This lead other companies to support it in their software including Adobe."
