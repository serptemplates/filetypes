      "An IDX file is a subtitles index file that points to the list of metadata information for subtitles inside a .sub (VobSub Subtitles) file. It is created and used by the VobSub software application that lets users extract subtitles from DVDs and dump in a SUB file. IDX files contain timestamps and byte offsets used to point to every single subtitle. VobSub always creates an IDX file along with the corresponding SUB file."

      "The SRT (SubRip file format) is a simple subtitle file saved in the SubRip file format. It is more commonly used as compared to the VobSub file format. Thus, if you want to convert SUB/IDX files to SRT file format, there are 3rd party tools available that can be used to acheive this. SUB/IDX to SRT converter, available on SubtitleTools.com is one such tool that takes SUB and IDX files as input and converts these VobSub subtitles to SRT files."
