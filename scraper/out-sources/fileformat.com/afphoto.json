      "An AFPHOTO file is an image file created by the image creation software, Serif Affinity Photo. It contains the overall contents of the image in the form of multiple image layers, shapes, text, paint strokes, swatches, coloring effects and lighting. Serif Affinity Photo is similar to Adobe Photoshop, rather it is an alternative to Adobe Photoshop with almost the same features and capabilities. Adobe Photoshop saves the files as .psd file while Affinity Photo files are saved with .afphoto extension.\n\nSerif Affinity Photo can open AFPHOTO files."
