      "A BOK file is a webpage file created by ProStores, once a popular web-based e-commerce platform that was later acquired by eBay. Like other webpages, BOK file contains dynamic content generated from the data available in the ProStores database. The BOK webpage is then hosted to the ProStores platform for listing products that are available to users for purchase. BOK page owners used to generate their store pages on ProStores and list the products for customers.\n\nBOK files can be edited with eBay ProStores and opened in any web browser such as Chrome, Firefox, and Apple Safari."
