      "A file with dcr extension contains the content of a digital photograph saved in the Kodak Digital Camera RAW (DCR) format. The DCR is short for Digital Camera Raw; contains the uncompressed and lossless version of the images data captured by a Kodak digital camera. The professional photographers like to use these files, because they store images at a higher quality than low quality compressed image formats."
