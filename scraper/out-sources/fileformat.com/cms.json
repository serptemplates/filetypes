      "A CMS file is a web page published by content management systems (CMS) that is used to generate documents for publishing over the internet. It is generated at run time and published to the web server for getting LIVE on the internet. A website generated with a CMS is most oftenly based on a theme based template that is used to create the CMS files. Since the same template is used for generating all the pages, all the pages are same in look and feel. CMS files can be stored in draft mode on the system in which case they are not published to the internet.\n\nCMS files can be opened with CMS applications such as JOOMLA and Web Browser."
