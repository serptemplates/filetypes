      "An MTS file is an AVCHD (Advanced Video Coding High Definition) video file shoot by typical camcorders. This file format is a standard video format that is used by many AVCHD compatible camcorders such as Sony and Panasonic HD camcorders. MTS allows you to record high-definition (HD) videos to transform or share them on your computer. The MTS file is being applied widely by many professionals and home users as their video file format in this modern era."
