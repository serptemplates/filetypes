      "A DBM (Daz Brick Material) file is a Shader Mixer network file created with 3D character modeling application, DAZ Studio. It describes the material of the 3D mode i.e. surface/displacement/interior volume. DAZ allows you to create your own custom shader by connecting a series of bricks together. This combines collectively as a DBM file that forms a shader network. It is the DBM file that specifies how a material is shaded.\n\nApplications that can open DBM files include DAZ 3D DAZ Studio 4."
