      "F4V (Flash MP4 Video File) is a video file saved with the .f4v extension. It is based on the ISO base media file format (MPEG-4 Part 12). It is very similar to MP4 which is why it is also referred to as the Flash MP4 informally. FLV had limitations when streaming H.264/ACC contents which resulted in Adobe Systems creating the new F4V format. Flash Player can play F4V files since the release of Flash Player 9 Update 3."
