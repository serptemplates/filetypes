      "An OBML16 file is a webpage saved using the Opera Mini mobile web browser. It is based on the Opera Binary Markup Language (OBML) and is a compact format for giving fast access to saved webpages. It replaced the OBML15 file format when Opera Mini version 7 was launched. All these variants of Opera Mini webpages were upgraded from the base OBML file format and each upgrade of Opera Mini is compatible with one OBML format only. OBML16 files can be converted to PDF and HTML online."
