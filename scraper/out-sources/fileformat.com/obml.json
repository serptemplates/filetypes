      "An OBML (Opera Binary Markup Language) file is an offline version of a webpage saved by Opera Mini mobile web browser. It is a self-contained, compact version of the HTML files that contains all the elements of the page for display on specific devices while offline. The OBML file format has upgraded to several versions with OBML15 and OBML16 being used at large. An important point to keep in consideration is that each Opera Mini version is only compatible with one OBML format. Thus, upgrading of Opera Mini will leave previously saved pages readable. OBML files can be converted to HTML and PDF."
