Yamaha “.sty” files contain style data defining the rhythm, accompaniment patterns, and other musical elements used by instrument, are used to enhance the playback of MIDI files by providing pre-programmed styles and arrangements.\n\nTo use a .sty file with a Yamaha keyboard or synthesizer, you typically transfer the file to instrument using a USB connection or a memory card. Once loaded, the instrument can then apply the style data to accompany MIDI playback or perform live with the selected style."
