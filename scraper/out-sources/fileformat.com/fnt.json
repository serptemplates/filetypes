      "A file with .fnt extension is a font file that stores generic font information on Windows Operating systems. FNT files have been mostly replaced by TrueType (.TTF) and OpenType (.OTF) file formats, and is an obsolete font file format as of now. These files can store a single rater or vector font. All device drivers support the Windows 2.x fonts. However, not all device drivers support the Windows 3.0 version."
