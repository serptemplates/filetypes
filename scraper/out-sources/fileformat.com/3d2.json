      "A file with .3D2 extension is a CAD-3D 2.0 file that stores multiple 3D objects and information about these objects. The lightning and colour palettes information used by the 3D objects are all stored in this file. A single file can hold up to 40 objects. 3D2 had been used as an early format for computer animations. 3DS files can be opened with Quick3D application software."
