      "A file with .mjs extension is a JavaScript source code file that is used as an ECMA Module (ECMAScript Module) in Node.js applications. Node.js’s natvie module system is CommonJS that is used to split the code in different files to keep the JS code organized. MJS is the only way used by Node.js to identify if the module is a CommonJS or an ES6. ECMAScript modules are standard formta for packaging JavaScript code for reuse. MJS files can be opened in text editors such as Atom, Vim, Apple xCode, Microsoft Visual Studio, and Notepad."
