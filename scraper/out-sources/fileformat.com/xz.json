    "description": [
      "XZ is a compressed file format that utilizes the LZMA2 compression algorithm. It was designed as a replacement for the popular gzip and bzip2 formats, and offers a number of advantages over these older standards. XZ files are well-supported across many platforms, and can be decompressed quickly and easily. While they are not as common as ZIP or RAR files, XZ archives can be used to store large amounts of data without sacrificing compression quality. If you need to compress or decompress large files, the XZ file extension is worth considering."
