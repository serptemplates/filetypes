      "MSWMM (Movie Maker Project) is a file format used by the Windows Movie Maker application, which is a video editing software developed by Microsoft for Windows operating systems. MSWMM files are used to save movie projects created using Windows Movie Maker. Just like WLMP files, MSWMM files are not video files, but rather project files that contain information about the arrangement of video clips, photos, and audio tracks in a movie project, as well as the applied effects and transitions.\n\nTo open an MSWMM file, you need to use the Windows Movie Maker application. Once the project is loaded into the application, you can edit it, add or remove elements, and export it as a video file format such as WMV or MP4 to be played on media players.\n\nThe information in an MSWMM file is stored in an XML (Extensible Markup Language) format, which is a markup language used for describing structured data. The MSWMM file contains a series of XML tags that describe the sequence of events in the movie project, such as the size and length of the video, the location and duration of each media clip, the applied transitions and effects, and other project-related details. The MSWMM file also includes references to the actual media files, such as video clips and audio tracks, but does not contain the actual media data.\n\nWhen a movie project is saved in Windows Movie Maker, it is saved as an MSWMM file, which can be opened and edited later using the Windows Movie Maker application. The MSWMM file serves as a blueprint for the final video production, which can be exported as a video file format such as WMV or MP4 to be played on media players."
