      "A GZIP file is a compressed archive that is created with the standard gzip (GNU zip) compression algorithm. The compressed archive may contain multiple files including compressed files, directories and file stubs. Most of the Unix systems include the open source gzip (GNU Zip) compressor utility for compression/decompression of files. GZIP files can be opened with applications such as WinZip."
