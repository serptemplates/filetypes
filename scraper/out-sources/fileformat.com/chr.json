      "A CHR file can also serve as font configuration file utilized by Microsoft Windows. This type of file stores essential data used for adjusting size and style of fonts within operating system. Software applications that interact with system fonts can make use of these “.chr” files to customize how these fonts appear on screen."

      "CHR files are not intended for manual opening or editing by users. Instead, they serve as configuration files that Windows programs, particularly those that interact with system fonts, can access when necessary. These programs load CHR files to retrieve information about how specific fonts should be displayed, including details about their size, style and other attributes. Users typically do not need to interact directly with CHR files, as font management is handled by operating system and software applications."
