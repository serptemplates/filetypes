      "An XPR file is a vector image file created with the now-discontinued Microsoft Expression Graphics (EGD) software. It contains graphics information that can used as user interface mockup. XPR files were later replaced by .design files in Microsoft Expression Design. XPR files could be opened with Microsoft Expression Studio that has been discontinued for quite some time now."
