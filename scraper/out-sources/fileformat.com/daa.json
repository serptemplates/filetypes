      "DAA (Direct Access Archive) is a proprietary file format for disk image files developed by PowerISO Computing. DAA supports features like compression, password protection, and splitting into multiple volumes. The advantage of using DAA instead of ISO is that DAA files are smaller in size and can be split into multiple files. DAA is also secure to transfer as it can be encrypted and password-protected."

      "Since DAA is a proprietary format, it’s primarily supported by PowerISO. Open the DAA file with PowerISO and either mount it as a virtual drive or extract its contents."
    ]

  "how_to_convert": {
    "instructions": [
      "If you need broader compatibility, you can convert a DAA file to an ISO format using PowerISO. Converting to ISO will allow the file to be used by other image-mounting software."
