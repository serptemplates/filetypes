      "FLIF (Free Lossless Image Format) is a lossless image format that uses the .flif extension for its files. FLIF claims to outperform PNG, lossless WebP, lossless BPG, and lossless JPEG 2000 in terms of compression ratio. FLIF uses progressive interlacing, due to which any partial download of the image can be used as a lossy encoding for the entire image."
