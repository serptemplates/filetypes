      "A file with .dat extension belongs to a generic file format. Usually these are niether encrypted nor binary, but they could be almost anything. Variety of applications are using the DAT files as references to certain operations in their respective program. So we can’t say that a specific software or program is responsible to create DAT files. These files are particularly accessed only by the application that created them."
