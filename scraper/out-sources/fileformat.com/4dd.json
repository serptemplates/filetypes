The data file is named after the name you type in the database creation dialogue box, followed by the 4DB.\n\nThe existing data file is opened as usual when you load a 4D structure file. If you alter the file’s name or location, the Open data folder dialogue box allows you to pick or build a new database."

      "4DD files are mostly associated with the 4th Dimension by the 4D, Inc. This 4th Dimension item range includes various Windows and Mac OS technologies that may be utilized as standalone elements or as part of a completely functional, Browser, bridge database creation solution.

It contains the real data that a 4D database architecture file refers to, and it can be compressed using the Compress file instruction in 4D Builder or 4D Client.\n\nMany archives are made up entirely of data sets. Opening unfamiliar files (e.g., 4DD) using a basic text writer like Windows Notepad may reveal portions of the information contained in the file. This technique allows the user to set the data of a large number of files, but not in the same way as a tool designed specifically for this purpose would."
