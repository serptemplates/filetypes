      "A file with the .cda extension is a small stub file generated automatically by the Microsoft Windows operating system for every track on a standard audio CD. Contrary to common belief, these CDA files do not contain the actual music data. Instead, they function as intelligent pointers, holding essential information like track timing and serving as a direct Windows shortcut to the corresponding audio data on the disc. In essence, a CDA file is a reference or a shortcut that tells the system where to find the specific music file located within the storage sectors of the CD itself."
