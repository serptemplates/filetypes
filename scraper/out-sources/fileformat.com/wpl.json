      "A file with .wpl extension contains the playlist of songs to be run on the Microsoft Windows Media Player. These files are usually created by users for their video and audio collections. The content written in a WPL file, is just directory paths or locations for the multimedia files selected by the creator of the .wpl file, so the media player application can promptly find and play the multimedia content from their directory locations."
