      "The .mjp file format, typically associated with Motion JPEG (MJPEG) video files, contains sequences of JPEG images stored as individual frames, making it a type of video file.\n\nHere are key details about MJP file\n\nFormat Type: Video format that uses a series of JPEG images to create a video sequence.Compression: Relies on JPEG compression for each frame, which results in a high-quality image at the cost of relatively larger file sizes.Common Usage: Found in digital cameras, mobile devices, and certain security and surveillance systems that use Motion JPEG for video capture.Playback Compatibility: Supported by various media players and video editing software, although support is less widespread than for formats like MP4 or AVI.\n\nAdvantages of MJP file\n\nHigh-Quality Frames: Each frame is individually compressed, making MJPEG suitable for scenarios where high-quality images are needed.Ease of Editing: Each frame is standalone, so editing specific frames without affecting others is straightforward.\n\nDisadvantages of MJP file\n\nLarger File Size: Due to minimal inter-frame compression, .mjp files can be significantly larger than modern video formats like MP4."
