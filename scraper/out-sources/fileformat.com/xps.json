      "An XPS file represents page layout files that are based on XML Paper Specifications created by Microsoft. It was developed as a replacement of EMF file format and is similar to PDF file format, but uses XML in layout, appearance, and printing information of a document. It is, in fact, more justified to say that XPS is an attempt on PDF, but couldn’t get enough popularity as owned by PDF for many reasons. Microsoft provides XPS Document Writer by default from Windows 7 onwards for the creation of XPS files. XPS files can be generated by selecting the “Microsoft XPS Document Writer” as printer while printing the document.\n\nXPS viewers come integrated as part of Windows Vista, Windows 7, Windows 8, and Internet Explorer 6 or later. XPS files become read-only once they are generated. This adds to the user’s confidence in received documents sent as XPS for the authenticity of the document. An XPS document can contain one or more pages as converted from the original document."
