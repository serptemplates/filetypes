      "A file with .ace extension is an ACE compressed file format that was developed by Marcel Lemke. It is the primary file format used by the WinAce compression application which was developed and available for Microsoft Windows platform only. The format was developed as an alternative to the ZIP file format but with discontinuation of the WinAce, the format couldn’t be carried out for long.",
      "160-bit Blowfish encryption is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a 160-bit key to encrypt data. It was designed by Bruce Schneier to be fast and secure, offering strong protection against unauthorized access. The algorithm operates in 64-bit blocks and supports variable key sizes, with 160-bit providing a high level of security. It’s commonly used in file compression and secure communication applications.",
      "WinAce is a file compression software for Windows that supports the ACE file format, offering high compression ratios and fast processing. It was known for creating and extracting ACE archives and supported other formats like ZIP and RAR. However, development of WinAce was discontinued, and it is no longer widely used today."
