      "An RPF file, which stands for “Rich Pixel Format,” is a proprietary image format associated with Alias/Wavefront’s Maya software. RPF files are typically used for storing various types of information about a rendered image, such as depth, motion vectors, object IDs, and other rendering passes. This format allows for greater flexibility and control when compositing rendered images in post-production software such as Adobe After Effects or Nuke.\n\nRPF files can store multiple layers of data within a single file, making them useful for compositing workflows. They are often used in visual effects and animation pipelines to facilitate the integration of CGI elements into live-action footage."

      "Here are some commonly used applications that can open RPF files:\n\nAutodesk Maya: Since RPF is closely associated with Maya, the software itself can open and render RPF files. Maya is widely used in animation and visual effects industry for 3D modeling, animation, and rendering.Adobe After Effects: After Effects is a popular compositing and motion graphics software that supports RPF files. You can import RPF files into After Effects to work with various layers of data and integrate them into your compositions.The Foundry Nuke: Nuke is a powerful node-based compositing software widely used in visual effects industry. It fully supports RPF files, allowing you to import them and manipulate different layers of data within software.Blackmagic Fusion: Fusion is another node-based compositing software that can open and work with RPF files. It provides tools for compositing, visual effects, and motion graphics.Eyeon Fusion: Fusion, now owned by Blackmagic Design, also has an older version called Eyeon Fusion. Both versions support RPF files for compositing and post-production work.3ds Max: While 3ds Max is more closely associated with the OpenEXR format for multi-layered images, it does have some compatibility with RPF files, allowing you to import them for certain purposes."
