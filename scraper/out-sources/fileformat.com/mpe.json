      "An MPE file is a video file encoded and saved in the MPEG file format. It was extended with additional bit-rates to be supported as the next version of MPEG-2 compression. MPEG-2, however, is the most commonly used MPEG compression type. The .mpe extension was used initially as a short for the .mpeg file format."
