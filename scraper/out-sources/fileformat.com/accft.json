      "A file with .accft extension is a Microsoft Access template file that holds definition of field data types for the tables of a database. Microsoft Access is a desktop Relational Database Management System (RDBMS) that is used to create tables based databases, forms, queries and views. The ACCFT file can be used to define the data types for the table fields and database tables can be created using this template file as starting point. It can be opened with Microsoft Access 2016 for creating new tables. ACCFT files are recognized by MIME type application/msaccess."
