      "A file with .xapk extension is a compressed package file that is used to install Android apps on mobile devices. It is a container file format that incorporates APK and additional associated files required for the installation. The other associated file is an OBB file that stores additional files such as graphics, media files, and app data that are required to keep the application running. XAPK files are not supported by Google Play and are used for distributing on third-party Android app download websites only. These can be installed to an Android device using XAPK Installer."
