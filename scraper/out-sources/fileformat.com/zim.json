      "Files with .zim extension are archives created to store Wiki content offline. It is considered as the most suitable open file format for storing Wikipedia on a USB. It stores site contents in a compact format. Its name comes from “Zeno IMproved” which was the earlier Zeno file format. ZIM is maintained by openZIM project which is sponsored by Wikimedia CH, and supported by the Wikimedia Foundation. ZIM files can be opened by applications such as Kiwix and ZIMReader. OpenZIM project has hosted the implementation of ZIM file format on Github for contribution from OpenSource community."
