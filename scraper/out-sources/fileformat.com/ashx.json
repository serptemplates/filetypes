      "An ASHX file is a webpage that is used by the ASP.NET HTTP Handler to serve user with the pages that are referenced inside this file. The ASP.NET HTTP Handler processes the incoming request, references the pages from the .ashx file, and sends back the compiled page back to the user’s browser. The method of processing is mostly similar to that of ASPX files with the differecne that in this case, the referenced pages/documents are processed and sent back."
