      "An A4P file is a project file created by A4Desk Pro software program that is used for creating Flash Websites. It is created with the templates included with the A4Desk Pro and doesn’t need one to have in-depth knowledge of Flash. A4P files created with templates can include website content in the form text and Flash animations. In case you don’t know about Flash, it was used to create animations that could be exported to SWF as well as GIF file formats for inclusion in websites."
