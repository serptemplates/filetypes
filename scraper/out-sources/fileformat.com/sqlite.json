      "A file with .sqlite extension is a lightweight SQL database file created with the SQLite software. It is a database in a file itself and implements a self-contained, full-featured, highly-reliable SQL database engine. SQLite database files can be used to share rich contents between systems by simple exchanging these files over the network. Almost all mobiles and computers use SQLite for storing and sharing of data, and is the choice of file format for cross-platform applications. Due to its compact use and easy usability, it comes bundled inside other applications. SQLite bindings exist for programming languages such as C, C#, C++, Java, PHP, and many others."
