      "The file format OXPS is known as Open XML Paper Specification. It’s a page description language and document format. Microsoft is the developer of this format. OXPS file format is very much familiar to these PDF files. The setup of the OXPS file is the same as an XPS format. The only difference is the description of OXPS as an open format. The .oxps file extension is the most current version of the XPS file format originated by Microsoft and Ecma International. If we talk about the specification, the OXPS and XPS files are used to publish, share, and allocate fixed-layout documents. As a substitute to PDFs, the OXPS file format can store text and multimedia data, with arranging features and printing layout characteristics."
