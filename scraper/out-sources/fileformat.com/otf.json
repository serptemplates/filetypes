      "OTF specifications are available publicly by Microsoft and can be referred to from developer’s perspective. Like TTF, it uses the same ‘sfnt’ container structure and is compatible with the TrueType specifications. Data inside an OpenType font file is used for different purposes such as calculating the text layout, defining glyphs as TrueType or Compact Font Format (CFF) outlines, providing monochromatic or color bitmaps or SVG documents as alternate glyph descriptions, and meta-data information."

      "A file with .otf extension refers to OpenType font format. OTF font format is more scalable and extends the existing features of TTF formats for digital typography. Developed by Microsoft and Adobe, OTF combines the features of PostScript and TrueType font formats. This makes OTF format to accommodate majority writing systems and that is why it is uniformly used on major computer platforms. The OpenType font format is supported by Mac OS X and Windows 2000 and later."
