      "The .dlis file format is a standard file format for the storage and exchange of well log data in the oil and gas industry. The format was developed by the Logging Industry Data Standard (LIDS) committee and it stands for “Digital Log Information Standard.” The format is designed to store well log data in a way that is easy to read, write and exchange between different systems.\n\nDLIS files contain a set of logical records that describe the well log data and its characteristics, such as the type of log data (e.g. resistivity, gamma ray), the measurement units, and the location of the data in the well. The actual log data is stored in separate binary files and is referenced by the logical records in the DLIS file."
