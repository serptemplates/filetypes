      "A PEM file is a security certificate file that is used to establish a secure communication channel between a web server and a browser. It is Base64-encoded and may contain a private key, server certificate, and/or a combination of other certificates. PEM files are similar to .der certificate files in terms of usage but is stored as Base64-encoded text rather than binary data. Other similar certificate file formats include .cer and .crt files.\n\nApplications that can open PEM files include text editors such as Microsoft Notepad and Apple TextEdit."
