      "An SVR file is a 3D file format used by SuperScape to create 3D interactive worlds. These three-dimensional interactive worlds can be viewed through web browsers with the SVR plugin. SVR files are similar to VRT file format but are compressed that results in smaller file size. Thus, SVR files are loaded faster and can also be shared over internet."
