      "The MKS files are generally known as Matroska files containing subtitles only. Although the Matroska is a general file container, it avoids keeping the information of specific formats. Since subtitles are being used in some of the audio or video containers, Matroska is paying attention to store some common subtitle formats. It helps Matroska to be consistent with the growth rate. You need to follow the points as given below to store the subtitles in Matroska:\n\nThe “.mks”. the extension will be used by the Matroska file (containing only subtitles).CodecPrivate is being used to store all codecs related information that is global to an entire stream.Remove the Start and stop timestamps that are used in a timestamp native storage format. Instead, use the Blocks timestamp and Duration.You can use anything with a transparent layer, including a video."
