      "A file with .an extension is an Adobe Edge Animate project file that contains information about the animation. A .html file is created when the project is saved which contains the references to the associated .css and .js files generated by Adobe Edge Animate. The AN file is saved along with these files that can be used to open the project file. Adobe edge animate can be used as an alternative to creating animated webpages using Adobe Flash, which is no more supported by browsers."
