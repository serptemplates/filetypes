      "An HEIC file is a High-Efficiency Container Image file format that can store multiple images as a collection in a single file. The format was adopted by Apple as variant of the HEIF with the launch of iOS 11. It was adopted as the default file format for storing images in compressed form on mobile devices. HEIC, like HEIF, are compressed using the High Efficiency Video Coding (HEVC) standard and are smaller in size without compromising the quality."
