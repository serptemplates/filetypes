      "A file with .fp7 extension is a database file created with FileMaker Pro versions 7-11. It stores data in tables with records where each record contains one or more fields. FP7 files have the capability to store large data including personal databases data and organizational records. A more newer version of FileMaker Pro is FMP12 that was introduced with the launch of FileMake Pro version 12. In addition to textual data, the FP7 file may also hold forms, charts, and other database objects. FP7 files can be opened with FileMaker Pro Advanced."
