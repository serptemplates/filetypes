      "This type of file format is compatible with Windows OS programs such as Xentec Vox Studio. It has specific features that are used to stimulate the speech of humans. Arcade games mostly use this format. The VOX file extension has a 32-byte header along with 10-byte indices and frames. The actual voice data is saved in frames in the form of segments in a single file. There is a different form of several bytes in each frame based on the type of encoding.\n\nThe clarify of voice is maintained at a low sampling rate which is rare in most audio formats. The algorithm used in these was mathematical.\n\nThis file is encoded by the use of ADPCM. It shorts the 16-bit audio data and 4-bit compression. So there is an advantage of saving bigger-sized audio information in a compact form using VOX files."

      "At a low sampling rate, the VOX files are specified to store digitized voice data. These are audio files that are commonly used in the applications specified for telephonic communications. This type of file format uses an algorithm of lossy compression which has an optimization for voice.\n\nCommonly used in speech applications the VOX files contain pre-recorded prompts of voice. This type of file format is also converted into other more popular formats. These can be used in Windows operating system and macOS.\n\nIt is mostly used for voiced recordings and compression. In this format, polyphonic data cannot be stored as it supports only homophobic data."
