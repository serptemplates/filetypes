      "The PRPROJ file format is the proprietary project file format used by Adobe Premiere Pro, a video editing software. PRPROJ files store all of the elements and information required for a video project, including video and audio clips, transitions, effects, and timeline and sequence settings. The file format is optimized for use with Premiere Pro and is not compatible with other video editing software. To open and edit a PRPROJ file, you must have Adobe Premiere Pro installed on your computer. Additionally, because PRPROJ files are saved in a proprietary format, they cannot be opened or edited with other software, and must be exported as a different file format if you need to share the project with someone who does not have access to Premiere Pro."
