      "TIFF file format is extensible and has underwent several revisions that allows the inclusion of an unlimited amount of private or special-purpose information. A TIFF file begins with an 8-byte header where the bytes are number from 0 to N. The largest possible TIFF file is 2**32 bytes in length. The file begins with an 8-byte image file header that points to an image file directly (IFD). An IFD contains information about the image as well as pointers to the actual image data."

      "TIFF or TIF, Tagged Image File Format, represents raster images that are meant for usage on a variety of devices that comply with this file format standard. It is capable of describing bilevel, grayscale, palette-color and full-color image data in several color spaces. It supports lossy as well as lossless compression schemes to choose between space and time for applications using the format. The format is not machine dependent and is free from bounds like processor, operating system, or file systems."
