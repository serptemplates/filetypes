      "A PCX file, Picture Exchange file, is a raster image file format that was used as native file format for PC Paintbrush application. It was developed by ZSoft Corporation, USA for DOS and Windows platforms and was adopted as the main imaging file format before the arrival of BMP, JPEG, and PNG file formats. PCX files are smaller in size as they are compressed using the RLE encoding. It is used in the multi-page DCX file that is primarily used to create digital fax files."
