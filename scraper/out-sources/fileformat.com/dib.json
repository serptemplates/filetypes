      "A Device-Independent bitmap (DIB) is a raster image file that is similar in structure to the standard Bitmap files(BMP/image/bmp/)). It contains a color table that describes the mapping of RGB colors to the pixel values. This enables DIB to represent image on any device. It can be opened with almost all applications that can open a standard BMP file on Windows as well as macOS. DIB are binary files and have a complex file format similar to BMP. DIB images are independent of the output capabilities of rendering devices in terms of color depth and pixel-per-inch."
