      "A file with .bak extension is usually a backup file that is used by different software tools to store backups of data. From database perspective, a BAK file is used by Microsoft SQL Server for storing the contents of a database. All the data and files associated with the database are stored in this file format to be retrieved in case the database may become corrupt or invalid for any reason. The backup files can be stored and indexed on other servers for safety purpose. Several applications can create BAK files such as SQL Server Management Studio, Transact-SQL, and Windows PowerShell."
