      "JPEG image file format was standardized by the Joint Photographic Experts Group and, hence, the name JPEG. The format has been the choice of storing and transmitting photographic images on the web. Almost all Operating systems now have viewers that support visualization of JPEG images, which are often stored with JPG extension as well. Even the web browsers support visualization of JPEG images. Before going into the JPEG file format specifications, the overall process of steps involved in JPEG creation need to be mentioned.",
      "A JPEG image is represented as a sequence of segments where each segment begins with a marker. Each marker starts with 0xFF byte followed by marker flag to represent the type of marker. The payload followed by marker is different as per marker type. Common JPEG marker types are as listed below:\n\nShort NameBytesPayloadNameCommentsSOI0xFF, 0xD8noneStart of ImageS0F00xFF, 0xC0variable sizeStart of FrameS0F20xFF, 0xC2variable sizeStart fo FrameDHT0xFF, 0xC4variable sizeDefine Huffman TablesDQT0xFF, 0xDBvariable sizeDefine Quantization Table(s)DRI0xFF, 0xDD4 bytesDefine Restart IntervalSOS0xFF, 0xDAvariable sizeStart Of ScanRSTn0xFF, 0xD//n//(//n//#0..7)noneRestartAPPn0xFF, 0xE//n//variable sizeApplication specificCOM0xFF, 0xFEvariable sizeCommentEOI0xFF, 0xD9noneEnd Of Image\n\nWithin the entropy-coded data, after any 0xFF byte, a 0x00 byte is inserted by the encoder before the next byte, so that there does not appear to be a marker where none is intended, preventing framing errors. Decoders must skip this 0x00 byte. This technique, called byte stuffing (see JPEG specification section F.1.2.3), is only applied to the entropy-coded data, not to marker payload data. Note however that entropy-coded data has a few markers of its own; specifically the Reset markers (0xD0 through 0xD7), which are used to isolate independent chunks of entropy-coded data to allow parallel decoding, and encoders are free to insert these Reset markers at regular intervals (although not all encoders do this)."

      "A JPEG is a type of image format that is saved using the method of lossy compression. The output image, as result of compression, is a trade-off between storage size and image quality. Users can adjust the compression level to achieve the desired quality level while at the same time reduce the storage size. Image quality is negligibly affected if 10:1 compression is applied to the image. The higher the compression value, the higher the degradation in image quality."
