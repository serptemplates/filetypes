      "A file with .wmz extension is a compressed version of WMF and is used to store metafiles. It is an intermediate level file generated by older versions of Microsoft Office applications and is not very popularly used. WMZ files are generated while saving documents to HTML format. These may also be generated while emailing documents that contain embedded clip art, equations, etc. Applications that can open WMZ files include (but not limited to) Corel Winzip and Apple Archive Utility."
