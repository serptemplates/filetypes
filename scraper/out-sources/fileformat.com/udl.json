      "The file with .udl extension is called Microsoft Universal Data Link file; specifying connection attributes; used by Windows apps to establish a connection with the database. The UDL file contains the connection string for an OLE DB data source; with username and password and essential connection string properties. To avoid directly specifying the properties by hand in a connection string, a Data Link Properties dialog box can be used to save connection information in a .udl file as an alternative."
