      "A CHAT file is a configuration file used by the IRC (Internet Relay Chat) for connecting to an IRC channel. It contains connection parameters such as server, port, name of the IRC channel, and optionally a password for opening an IRC channel. The settings are used by the client to connect to other channels. The chats and discussions on IRC are one-to-one and are private.\n\nApplications that can open CHAT files include mIRC and Visual IRC."
