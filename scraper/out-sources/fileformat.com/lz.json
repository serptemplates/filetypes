      "A file with .lz extension is a compressed archive file created with Lzip, which is a free command-line tool for compression. It supports concatenation to compress support files. LZ files have media type application/lzip and support higher compression rations than BZ2. LZ are based on the LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain) algorithm and include a 32-bit CRC checksum and ident bytes for checking the integrity of the file."
