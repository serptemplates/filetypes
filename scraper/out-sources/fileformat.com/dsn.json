      "DSN stands for “Data Source Name” and it is a file format used to store database connection information. DSN files are typically used in conjunction with ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) and allow for easy access to a specific database by providing the necessary information to connect to it, such as the server name, username, and password. The file is usually in plain text and can be created and edited using a text editor. It can be used on various operating systems like Windows, Linux and Mac."

      "A DSN file is a plain text file that stores information used to connect to a database, such as the server name, username, and password. It is typically used in conjunction with ODBC (Open Database Connectivity) to provide easy access to a specific database.\n\nTo open and view the contents of a DSN file, you can use any text editor such as Notepad, Sublime Text, Atom, etc. These programs will allow you to open the DSN file and view the connection information stored within it.\n\nHowever, to use the DSN file to connect to a database and execute operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE etc, a program with ODBC support, such as a programming language like Python, Java, C# or a database management tool like Microsoft Access, SQL Server Management Studio is required. These programs can use the information in the DSN file to connect to the database and perform the desired operation."
