      "CHR file format is associated with 3ds Max, a powerful software used for 3D modeling, rendering and animation. These files serve as repositories for three-dimensional character models, which can encompass both static and animated characters. Inside “.chr” file, you’ll find comprehensive representation of character, including its geometry (shape and structure), textures (surface appearance), lighting effects and various other properties related to 3D model.\n\nThese character models are instrumental in creation of characters that find their way into various media forms, such as video games, movies and television productions. By encapsulating all essential visual and structural elements within “.chr” file, 3D artists and animators can efficiently develop and manipulate characters for use in these different forms of entertainment."
