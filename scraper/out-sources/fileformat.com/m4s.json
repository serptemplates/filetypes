      "An M4S file is a small segment of a video that is streamed over the internet using the MPEG-DASH streaming technique. It contains a video segment in the form of binary data. The receiving application (usually a web browser or media players) plays these segments in the order they are received. The first M4S segment is identified by the initialization data that it contains. In summary, M4S files are small individual media segments of a complete file."
