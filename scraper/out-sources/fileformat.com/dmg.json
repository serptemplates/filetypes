      "A file with a .dmg extension is an Apple Disk Image file and known as a Mac OS X Disk Image file. DMG file format is the most widely used disk image file intended to allocate applications and files among the Apple PCs. It’s very convenient to mount DMG files into a virtual drive or can use Apple Disk Utility software to open and view the content of DMG file format. The old version of IMG files used in Mac OS Classic is substituted by the DMG file format. DMG files are generated for Mac users and are not supported by Windows OS but users can access the DMG content in the Windows Operating system by using compression and decompression tools like 7-Zip, Pea Zip, etc. The DMG file extension is also used by the Oracle Export and Ingress tool for scrapheap files kept in the binary format of the Oracle database."
