      "A file with .fodg extension is an Apache OpenOffice Drawing file format for storing drawing elements. It is based on the file format specifications outlined by Advancement of Structural Information Standards (OASIS). Another similar file format for OpenOffice graphics is ODG that stores drawing elements as a vector image. FODG files can be opened with OpenOffice as well as LibreOffice. Other file formats supported by OpenOffice, for example, include ODT, ODF, ODP and ODS."
