The company has developed several games and used the VID file format for storing game recordings. In addition to video, these can also store audio data related to the game. Some of the famous games by Bethesda using VID file format include Skynet and The Elder Scrolls II: Daggerfall. Bethesda software doesn’t support VID file format anymore."
