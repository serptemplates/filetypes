      "An FP5 file is a database file created with FileMaker Pro version 5 or 6. It stores user as well as organizational data in the form of records inside tables. FileMaker Pro is a database management system having support for Macintosh and Windows operating systems. FP5 is an older file format that was supported by the then available FileMaker Pro version. The latest FileMaker Pro database format is FMP12 that was introduced with the launch of FileMaker Pro v 12. Other well used database file format was FP7 that was replaced by FMP12."
