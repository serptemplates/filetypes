      "JS (JavaScript) are files that contain JavaScript code for execution on web pages. JavaScript files are stored with the .js extension. Inside the HTML document, you can either embed the JavaScript code using the <script></script> tags or include a JS file. Similar to CSS files, JS files can be included in multiple HTML documents for code reusability. JavaScript can be used to manipulate the HTML DOM."
