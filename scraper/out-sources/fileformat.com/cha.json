      "A CHA file is a user settings file created by the IRC clients such as mIRC. It contains parameters such as the server, port, channel name and, optionally, a password for opening an IRC channel. IRC clients are used to communicate with others on the IRC networks around the world. These are used for one-to-one private discussions or in multi-group conferences. When a CHA file is clicked, the IRC client automatically opens with the details mentioned in the file.\n\nApplications that can open CHA files include mIRC and Visual IRC."
