      "A file with .jfproj extension is a JSON based custom font created with Microsoft Font Maker application on Windows 10. These can be created by using electronic pen with touch screen devices such as tablets although other computer peripherals such as mouse can also be used in case of computers. JFPROJ files contain the glyphs that are used to render the characters to the screen by defining the spacing between characters and words, and size of the font. Microsoft Font Maker app is available for download on Windows store."
