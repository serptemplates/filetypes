      "The .epim file extension is used by EssentialPIM, a personal information manager software that allows users to organize and manage their contacts, appointments, tasks, and notes. The .epim file is a database file that stores all the data entered into the program, including personal information, calendar events, and task lists. This file can be backed up, exported and imported to another EssentialPIM installation. The software is available for Windows, Android, and iOS platforms.\n\nThe .epim files are the proprietary format used by EssentialPIM. It is important to note that .epim files are specific to EssentialPIM software and cannot be opened or edited with other software."
