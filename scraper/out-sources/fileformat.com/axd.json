      "An AXD file is a web settings file that is used for handling and retrievign embedded resource requests in ASP.NET. It comprises of instructions for retreiving embedded resources such as images, JavaScript (.JS) files, and .CSS files. AXD files are used for injecting resources into client-side pages. This allows client pages to access these resources on server in a standard way.",
      "Most ASP.NET projects save AXD files as WebResource.axd files that allow client-side pages to download resources that are embeddedin an assembly. Your application may face slow performance in case you run it in debug mode as WebResources.axd handler is not cached."
