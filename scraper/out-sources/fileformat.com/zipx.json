      "A ZIPX file is an extended version of the standard ZIP file that has been compressed using an advanced version of compression. This advanced compression method is developed by CorelWinZip that compresses all the files using the extended ZIPX format. ZIPX files are smaller in size than ZIP file format and makes data transfer over the internet more efficient. ZIPX files require WinZip to be installed on the system in order to open them."
