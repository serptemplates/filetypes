It’s used for voicemail, voice notes, and other voice-based features.To reduce the data size, QCP files have a lower bitrate, making them ideal for devices with limited storage or for transmitting over networks with limited bandwidth.These files may not be easily playable on all devices but can be opened with specific audio players or converted to more widely-used formats like MP3 or WAV using conversion tools.It is often identified with the MIME type audio/qcp.",
      "PureVoice Audio is a technology developed by RealNetworks, primarily designed for high-quality voice communication over the internet. This audio codec optimizes voice transmission by reducing bandwidth usage while maintaining clarity and fidelity. It is often used in applications like voice-over-IP (VoIP), video conferencing, and online gaming, where clear audio is essential. PureVoice leverages compression techniques to ensure efficient data transfer, allowing for smooth and reliable voice interactions even in varying network conditions"
