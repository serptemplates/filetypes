      "A file with .indt extension is an Adobe InDesign layout template file that contains predefined settings. The design and contents of these files include templates of newsletters, books, magazines, flyer, and print media. Once editing is finished, the INDT file can be saved to disc as INDD file. User can also create new INDT file from within the InDesign and convert it to other formats such as PDF, EPUB, or JPEG."

    "instructions": [
      "Opening an INDT file is quite simple. Just double-click it, and it will open in Adobe InDesign as a new file (not the original). This way, you won’t accidentally change the main template.\n\nYou need Adobe InDesign to open or edit an INDT file. You cannot use other programs because INDT is made just for InDesign. However, you can share INDT files with others who use InDesign, even if they have a different version, and the design will stay the same."
