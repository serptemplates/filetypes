      "The AVI file format is an Audio Video multimedia container file format that was introduced by Microsoft. It holds the audio and video data created and compressed using several codecs (Coders/Decoders) such as XVid and DivX. Since different codecs can be used to encode the AVI contents, the retrieving applications i.e. AVI players, should be able to open these only if they have the required codecs installed with which the AVI contents were created. The format is supported by default on all Microsoft Windows platforms as well as on almost all other major platforms. Several applications and APIs provide the capability to create/save, read and convert AVI to other popular formats such as MP4, MOV, WMV, etc."
