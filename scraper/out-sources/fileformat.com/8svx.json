      "Developed by Electronic Arts, the 8SVX file format is a digital audio standard specifically for Amiga computers, functioning as a dedicated data subtype of the broader IFF container format. It stores 8-bit audio samples within distinct data chunks, while separate descriptor chunks contain all the crucial metadata about the audio stream. While Amiga computer systems are now rarely in active use, the primary modern application of 8SVX files is the preservation and playback of classic video game music and retro audio samples from that era."
