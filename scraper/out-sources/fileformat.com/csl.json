      "A Corel Symbol Library (CSL) file is a library of symbols used within CorelDRAW software. It stores symbols that can be used in other files. CSL files can be stored locally or on a network to let them accessible for easy deployment and management. These are saved with the CorelDRAW file along with all the symbol instances used within the document."
