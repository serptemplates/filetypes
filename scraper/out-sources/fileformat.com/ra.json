      "RealAudio (RA) is a proprietary audio format developed by Real Networks, Inc. and released in April 1995. It uses the .ra extension for its files. It uses low-bitrate as well as high fidelity audio codecs. RA was used for audio streaming over the internet by many internet radio stations. The BBC website used RA heavily until 2009 but discontinued in March 2011."
