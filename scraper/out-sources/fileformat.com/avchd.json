      "An AVCHD file is a recording file format introduced for saving high-definition(HD) videos to DVDs, hard disk drives, and memory cards. AVCHD videos, recorded onto DVD and Blu-ray, can be played easily on most Blu-ray Disc players. Also, the AVCHD stuff can also be recorded on SD cards and played by many Blu-ray Disc players, television sets, and media consoles. The ffdshow tryouts and Libavcodec are the open-source codecs that can decode the AVCHD files."
