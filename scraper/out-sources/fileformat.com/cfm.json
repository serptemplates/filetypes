      "The web pages and files used in Cold Fusion Markup Language contain extensions of CFM and are named CFM web pages. This web development scripting language runs on Google App Engine, .NET framework, and JVM. It can contain a programming language or code of the language. When any of its pages are accessed by the user, the webserver of ColdFusion executes it. CFScript (that is close to JavaScript) or tags can be used to write CFML. CFML can be used for generating other languages apart from HTML like CSS, JavaScript, XML, and more.\n\nThe use of this language and tags that it supports is mostly in developing dynamic web applications The files can be directly run in the browser online if any error occurs during offline usage of the platform of development of the application.\n\nCFML works in a way that specific server file extensions (.cfc, .cfm) are given for processing to the CFML engine. If the engines are based on Java, it is achieved using Java servlets. The engine of CFML only processes functions and tags and it returns functions and text outside the CFML tags to the webserver without any change."
