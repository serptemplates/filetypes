      "A PEF file is a file format commonly associated with digital photography and is used by Pentax cameras. PEF stands for Pentax Electronic File and is a raw image file format, meaning it contains minimally processed data directly from the camera’s image sensor.\n\nPEF files store raw image data captured by camera, including information such as color temperature, exposure settings and sensor data. They retain a higher level of detail and provide greater flexibility for post-processing compared to compressed image formats like JPEG.",
      "The PEF file format is a proprietary format developed by Pentax for storing raw image data captured by their digital cameras. PEF stands for Pentax Electronic File. It is a binary format, meaning it stores data in a format that is not directly human-readable. The specific structure and organization of PEF file format are known only to Pentax, as they have not publicly disclosed the detailed specifications of the format.\n\nPEF files contain a combination of header information, metadata, image sensor data and other data structures specific to Pentax cameras. The exact layout and organization of these components within the file are specific to PEF format and may vary depending on the camera model and firmware version."
