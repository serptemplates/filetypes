      "A CT (Continuous Tone) file is a raster image file used by Scitex graphics processing equipment. Several graphics suites such as Adobe Photoshop, Adobe InDesign, and QuarkXPress supports its usage for rendering. Data image is stored inside the CT file in CMYK (Cyan, Magenta, Yellow Key), RGB, and grayscale image formats, but they don’t support alpha channels. CT files can be opened with applications such as Adobe Photoshop 2022, Adobe InDesign 2022, and XnViewMP."
