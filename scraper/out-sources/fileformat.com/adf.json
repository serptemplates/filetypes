      "A file with .adf extension is a database file created with ACT CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software to store relationship data about customers. It stores information about customer’s name, email, contact, business information, and relationship history. CRM systems are more often integrated with call centres established by businesses to automatically retrieve user information for incoming calls. ADF files can be opened with SwiftPage ACT software on Windows OS."
