      "The PDN file format is the native format used by Paint.NET, which is a popular free image and photo editing software. The format is specifically designed to store images created or edited in Paint.NET application. The format preserves all layers, settings and effects that occur during editing the image so that user can continue to edit the images without worrying to lose original information relating to source image.\n\nPDN file format is more advanced than other formats like JPEG or PNG because of its ability to support multiple layers. Because of this feature, user can edit individual elements of an image without disturbing the whole composition of image. It also has support for transparency which enable users to create complex designs and graphics that require transparency. Since, PDN retains all editing information of image, user can revise their projects at any time and make changes without compromising quality because of this reason PDN files are larger than other image formats due to extra data inside them that keep the information of layers and effects.\n\nIf you are working on project that is not yet complete, saving in PDN format enables you to return and make further edits easily. Once, you are satisfied with your work, you can export it to other formats like PNG, JPEG or BMP for sharing, printing or online use.",
      "Paint.NET is a free image and photo editing software for Windows. It was originally developed as a student project at Washington State University as an alternative to Microsoft Paint. From that time, it is evolving into a powerful tool having features comparable to professional editors. It supports layers, special effects and other wide range of tools for editing. It is suitable for both beginners and advanced users. It has user friendly and intuitive interface and has active community that provides plugins to expand its functionality."
