      "A SIFZ file is a gzip compressed SIF file created by the open source 2d animations creation application Synfig Studio. It contains multiple graphical elements that make up for the animation. The overall animation contents are built using a combination of a canvas that is filled with shapes, brush or pencil strokes, and text. All these are arranged at their own positions, radius, tangent, angle, vertex, and width handles. SIFZ files can be opened with Synfig Studio."
