      "A PCT file is a Macintosh Picture Image file format that was the default file format for Apple QuickDraw programme. It was developed by Apple but after the discontinuation of QuickDraw programme, it is no more in use. PDF, at large, has replaced the PCT and similar file formats. PCT files can also be sometimes found with .pict file extension, though both PCT and PICT have the same file format."
