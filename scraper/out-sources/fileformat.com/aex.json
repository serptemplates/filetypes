      "An AEX file (with .aex extension) is a compiled Xbasic file that contains compiled program code for global functions. It can be used in web applications by calling them from server side .a5w pages. AEX files were loaded and unloaded by calling a5w_load_aex and a5w_unload_aex functions respectively from A5W files. However, in new implementation, these files are loaded into memory by including in the a5_application.5i file. Xbasic programming language is used by Alpha Anywhere software for development of Mobile and Web applications."
