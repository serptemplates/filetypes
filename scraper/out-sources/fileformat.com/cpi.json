      "CPI stands for “Clip Information” and is used to store metadata about individual video clips within an AVCHD directory structure. These .CPI files contain information about video clips, such as start and end times of each clip, format of video (resolution, frame rate, etc.) and other details.\n\nThe .CPI files are usually stored in subfolder within AVCHD directory structure on camcorder or other recording device. These files are essential for organizing and playing back video clips, as they provide necessary information for software and devices to understand and display video content correctly."

      ".CPI files are typically not intended to be opened directly by users. Instead, when you use video players or editors to work with AVCHD video content stored in .MTS files, associated .CPI file is automatically loaded if it is correctly linked to MTS file. In other words, these .CPI files serve as important behind-the-scenes data that helps video software understand and manage associated video clips. This linkage ensures that software can interpret things like clip information, video and audio formats and timestamps, making it easier for you to navigate and edit your AVCHD video content.\n\nPrograms that open or reference CPI files include\n\nAdobe Premiere Pro 2023 (Free Trial) for (Windows, Mac)Kdenlive (Free) for (Windows, Mac, Linux)"
