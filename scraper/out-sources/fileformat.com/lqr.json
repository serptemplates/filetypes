      "The LQR file type is mainly related to a compressed archive file that covers one or more files that have been abridged in terms of file size for easy distribution via the Internet or through transferrable media like optical disks such as DVDs and CDs among other exterior data storage devices. Any file stored in LQR File format can be combined with compression provisions executed by a certain compression algorithm. Files in the LQR format are pinned with the .lqr extension. Now, the LQR extension has been substituted by more extensively used compression standards and encoding features, including the RAR and ZIP format."
