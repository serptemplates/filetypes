      "Here is a brief overview of AIF file structure:\n\nFORM chunk: The file starts with a FORM chunk, which serves as main container for all other chunks in file. It identifies the file as AIF file.COMM chunk: This chunk contains information about audio data such as the sample rate, bit depth, number of channels and duration of the audio.SSND chunk: The audio data itself is stored in SSND (Sound Data) chunk. It contains actual audio samples in PCM format. This chunk also includes information like the offset, block size and data size.Optional chunks: AIF files can include additional chunks for storing metadata or other types of information. Some common optional chunks include NAME (file name), AUTH (author), ANNO (annotation) and INST (instrumentation).\n\nEach chunk has a specific identifier, size and data associated with it. The file structure is typically sequential, with chunks appearing one after another within the file. AIF files can be both uncompressed and lossless, meaning they retain the original audio quality. However, due to lack of compression, AIF files tend to be larger in size compared to compressed audio formats like MP3."

      "A staple in professional audio production, the Audio Interchange File Format (AIF) was pioneered by Apple Inc. as a solution for storing high-fidelity, uncompressed audio data. Renowned for its exceptional sound quality, the AIF format is a top choice for musicians, sound engineers, and audio professionals.\n\nIts core strength lies in its use of PCM (Pulse Code Modulation), a method that captures the original audio waveform directly without any data compression. While this approach results in larger file sizes compared to lossy formats like MP3, it guarantees pristine, bit-for-bit audio reproduction. Thanks to its robust design, AIF files enjoy broad compatibility and are supported by a vast array of digital audio workstations (DAWs) and media players across different software and hardware platforms.",
