It comprises of the edited image in PhotoPad along with the record of all the edits made to different components (such as layers, text, adjustments) of that image. This lets you revert to a previous editing stage and start editing from that point. PPP Project files can be opened in PhotoPad software and can be exported to popular image file formats such as JPG, PNG, TIFF, GIF, and PSD."
