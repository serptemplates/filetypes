      "The .vqf file extension is used for TwinVQ files. The TwinVQ is an audio format which was developed by Nippon Telegraph and Telephone Corporation and marketed by Yamaha by using the SoundVQ as name. It was announced by the developers that TwinVQ files are about 30 to 35% smaller than MP3 files of a certain quality. The higher quality is achieved at the cost of higher processor usage."
