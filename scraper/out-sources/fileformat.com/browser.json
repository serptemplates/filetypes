      "The BROWSER definition files use a hierarchical structure. Each .browser file contains an XML markup that includes the capabilities and features of a particular browser or a group of browsers. These details include characteristics such as agent string, version numbers, and support for technologies such as JavaScript, CSS, or other HTML elements. By using these browser definition files, ASP.NET developers customize user experiences based on the capabilities of different browsers."
