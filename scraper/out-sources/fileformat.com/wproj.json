      "A file with the .WPROJ file extension is typically a Wwise Project file. Wwise is a software application developed by Audiokinetic that is used for sound design and audio integration in video games and other interactive media. A Wwise Project file is a project file created by Wwise that stores information related to sound assets, sound banks, mix settings, and other project-specific data. The file is used to manage and organize the audio assets and settings for a specific project.\n\nWwise Project files can be created and edited in Wwise software and can be exported to different platforms such as Windows, Mac, Linux, and different gaming consoles such as PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and more. The “.wproj” file extension is used specifically for Wwise Project files and is not used for any other purpose."
