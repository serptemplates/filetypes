      "A file with .mbw extension is primarily associated with MBRWizard by Firesage Solutions. The Master Boot Record Wizard (MBRWizard) backs up your computer’s MBR and saves it to an MBW file that can be restored if needed. In addition to MBR and VBR (Volume Boot Record) copies, these files can contain GPT, user-defined sectors, or whole disk images. The MBR is a vital, 512-byte long record on your hard drive that allows your Operating System to boot. It can also hold the partition table and a 32-bit signature identifying the disk media."
