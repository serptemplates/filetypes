      "A WHL (Wheel) file is a distribution package file saved in Python’s wheel format. It is a standard format installation of Python distributions and contains all the files and metadata required for installation. The WHL file also contains information about the Python versions and platforms supported by this wheel file. Similar to an MSI setup file, WHL file format is a ready-to-install format that allows running the installation package without building the source distribution."
