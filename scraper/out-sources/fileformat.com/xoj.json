      "An XOJ file is a notebook file that contains notes taken using the hand note-taking software Xournal. Xournal is a free, multi-platform application that lets you create notes with different content types such as text, images, and hand-written doodles. XOJ files are created when a new notebook file is created with Xournal. These XOJ files can be shared with other users as well for data sharing. A more recent version of Xournal is Xournal++ that is cross-platform variant of Xournal."
