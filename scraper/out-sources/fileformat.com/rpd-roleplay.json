      "An “RPD” file is a specialized data file associated with Roleplay Designer, a collaborative e-learning development system tailored for crafting decision-based training modules. Within this system, these files store essential information that outlines the structure of the training scenarios that have been meticulously designed. Each “RPD” file holds a blueprint of the interactive elements, branching paths, and various decision points that make up the training experience.\n\nWhen it comes to using the training modules, these “RPD” files serve as repositories of information. They’re accessed and loaded by the Roleplay Designer system during training sessions. The data contained in the files guides the system in presenting the scenarios, handling user interactions, and providing feedback based on the decisions made by participants.\n\nPlease note Roleplay Designer has been discontinued, which means that finding official support or documentation for the “RPD” file format might be challenging. In such cases, individuals working with these files may need to explore methods like analyzing the files’ content, seeking assistance from past users of the software, attempting to reverse engineer the format, or considering alternative tools to achieve their e-learning development goals."
