It stores data in database tables that are linked to each other via primary and foreign keys. The MDB file contains complete structure of the database tables, queries, stored procedures. MDB is the default file format for Microsoft Access 2003. The lateral versions of Microsoft Access use the ACCDB file formats which is the latest file format to date.
