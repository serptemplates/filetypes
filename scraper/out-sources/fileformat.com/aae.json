      "AAE is a file type found on iOS 8 and newer, macOS 10.10 or later systems. It stores information about any edits made to .jpg photos in the Photos app. AAE files are in addition to original files and let users revert photos to their original state if required. When images are imported from macOS to Windows, the accompanying AAE files also get transferred.",
      "JPG is a widely used image format for photos, known for its efficient compression. Apple’s AAE files, created by Apple, are XML-based records that store editing instructions applied to JPG images within the Photos app. This system enables non-destructive editing, preserving the original JPG while the AAE file maintains a record of the edits.\n\nIt’s important to note that AAE files are specifically designed for Apple devices and the Photos app. If you transfer edited photos to a non-Apple device or use a different photo editing application, the edits may not be visible. To preserve the changes, you might need to ’export’ the edited photo as a new JPG file."
