      "The JPM file format standard specifies it to be a binary container to represent a compound image by which multiple images can be combined into a single image. It sets the mechanism for grouping multiple images in a hierarchy of layout objects, pages and page collections to store JPEG 2000 and other compressed image data formats. The format includes the mechanism of incorporating metadata (often referred to as structural metadata in digital library projects)."

      "JPM refers to JPEG 2000 image coding system Part 6 which is used for document imaging. It is based on the Mixed Raster Content Standard (ISO/IEC 16485) and contains layered still images that use JPEG 2000 and other encodings. In addition to its own specifications, JPM file format inherits features from its parent i.e. the jp2 file format."
