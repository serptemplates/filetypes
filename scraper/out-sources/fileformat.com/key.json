      "A KEY file is the private part of a security mechanism that is saved to disc in Privacy-Enhanced Mal (PEM) file format. It is used to decrypt information exchanged between a web browser and the web server that serves the browsing requests. A KEY file contains encoded strings that are useless for human eye but are the essence of encrypting/decrypting information exchange as part of SSL certificate on web servers. KEY files are automatically generated and are installed at client end.\n\nYou can open KEY files with any text editor such as Microsoft Notepad (Windows), Apple TextEdit (Mac), or GitHub Atom (cross-platform). KEY files are similar to CRT and CER file formats."
