      "Computer Graphics Metafile (CGM) is free, platform-independent, international standard metafile format for storing and exchanging vector graphics (2D), raster graphics, and text. CGM uses an object-oriented approach and many function provisions for image production. CGM uses these object-oriented characteristics for remolding graphical elements to render an image. A metafile contains necessary information that defines other files. In CGM, a text-based source file contains all graphical elements that can be later compiled into a binary file. Basically, CGM is a way to facilitate 2D graphical data interchange, independent from any particular platform, or device.\n\nCGM format provides different elements to perform functions, and signify objects to adjust geometric primitives and graphical information. Although CGM has been superseded by other formats to display graphic arts on web pages as it is not well supported by web pages, still very popular among industrial, aeronautical, and other technical applications. Though World Wide Web Consortium has developed WebCGM, an alternative approach for the use of CGM on the Web. The primary CGM implementation was an illustration of the sequence of basic operations of the Graphical Kernel System (GKS). It has not been much adopted in professional designs but has largely supplanted by other formats such as DXF and SVG."
