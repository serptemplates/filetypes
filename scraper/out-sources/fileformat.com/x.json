      "A file with .x extension refers to DirectX 3D Graphics legacy file format that was introduced with Microsoft DirectX 2.0. It was used for 3D graphics rendering in games and specifies the structures for meshes, textures, animations, and user-defined objects. It has been deprecated since 2014 as the Autodesk FBX file format serves better as a more modern format. X is template-driven and is free of any usage knowledge.\n\nYou can open DirectX X files using Microsoft DirectX and common text editors."
