      "A file with .ade extension is a Microsoft Access Project file that contains the compiled output of the information contained in the Microsoft Access ADP project file. Information in the Access project file, other than Visual Basic for Applications (VBA), is available in compiled form in ADE files. Data is stored in compressed format in these files to reduce the file size and improve performance in Access. Since ADE is the compiled output of the Access project file, any VBA source code which is part of the project, remains protected by not allowing it to be part of the output. ADE files can be opened in Microsoft Access 365."
