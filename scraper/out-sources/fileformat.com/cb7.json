      "A CB7 file refers to Comic Book 7-Zip Archive. It is compressed file format commonly used for storing and distributing comic book collections digitally. CB7 files are created using 7-Zip compression software, which is known for its high compression ratio.",
      "The CB7 file format is a variant of 7-Zip file format specifically designed for storing and compressing comic book collections. It combines compression capabilities of the 7-Zip format with the ability to organize and package comic book pages into a single archive.\n\nThe CB7 format itself is essentially a 7-Zip archive with a specific file extension (.cb7) indicating its association with comic book content. It utilizes the LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain algorithm) compression algorithm, which is known for its high compression ratio and efficient use of system resources.\n\nInternally, a CB7 file contains multiple comic book pages or images that make up the comic book collection. These pages are typically stored individual image files, such as JPEG, PNG or GIF within the archive. The organization and naming conventions of these pages may vary depending on the creator or provider of the CB7 file."
