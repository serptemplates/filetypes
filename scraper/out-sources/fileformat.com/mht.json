      "A file with .mht extension is a MIME enabled archiving file format that contains different types of data into a single file. It can store data such as text, images, page styling in the form of CSS files, JavaScript, and other resources as embedded resources in it. MHT files, having MIME type message/rfc822, encapsulate all the contents of an HTML file as a single archive file for storing on archiving on storage devices. Software applications such as Microsoft Word lets you convert your WORD documents to MHT by exporting as MHT file. MHT files can be opened using popular browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explore and Google Chrome."
