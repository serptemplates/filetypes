      "The CHM file format represents Microsoft HTML help file that consists of a collection of HTML pages. It provides an index for quick accessing the topics and navigation to different parts of the help document. The CHM file can be searched for contents via the provided search option. CHM is Microsoft Proprietary online help file format that is often used for software documentation. In addition, it is used in several other applications like training guides, interactive books, and electronic newsletters. Most of the modern Microsoft Development environments support generating CHM documentation from information available in the application.\n\nThe unique ability of CHM file format to implement a combined table of contents and index makes it distinct over other standard HTML pages. The generated CHM file is relatively small in size and, hence, can easily be distributed with software packages. The help authoring tool, HTML Help Workshop, provides an easy-to-use system for creating and managing help projects and their related files. CHM files may include text, images, and hyperlinks; viewable in a Web browser; used by Windows and other programs as an online help solution."
