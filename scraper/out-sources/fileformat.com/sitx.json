      "A file with .sitx extension is a compressed archive file created with StuffIt software. This format was introduced as an extension to the original standard Stuffit (.sit) file format and offers comparatively more compression to its predecessor. SITX files are more compact and occupy less space along with the support for 512-bit compression aimed for security. SITX files are recognized by their Internet media types as application/x-stuffitx and application/x-sitx with Uniform Type Identifier as com.stuffit.archive.sitx."
