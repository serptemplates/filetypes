      "An SKP file is a proprietary three-dimensional model file created with the 3D design program SketchUp. It can comprise of several different 3D elements or components such as shades, wireframes, and textures. An SKP file can contain the entire architecture or may consist of smaller designs (such as door or a chair) of a larger design. This lets the models defined in such files to be reusable by inserting into other SketchUp documents.\n\nSKP files can be identified by their extension i.e. .skp that can easily be searched and found on a system by using the Operating System’s search feature."
