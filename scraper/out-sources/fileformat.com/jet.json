      "A JET database file, also known as a Microsoft Access database file, is a file format used by Microsoft Access, a popular database management system (DBMS). JET stands for Joint Engine Technology, which was the original name of the database engine that Microsoft Access used. Later versions of Access have used different database engines, but the term “JET database” is still commonly used to refer to Access databases.\n\nHere are some key points about JET database files:\n\nFile Extension: JET database files typically have a file extension of “.mdb” for older versions of Access (Access 2003 and earlier) and “.accdb” for newer versions (Access 2007 and later). The “.mdb” files use the older JET database engine, while “.accdb” files use the newer ACE (Access Database Engine) technology.Relational Database: JET databases are relational databases, which means they store data in tables with defined relationships between them. Users can create, modify, and query data using SQL (Structured Query Language) or through the Access graphical interface.Data Storage: JET databases can store a wide range of data types, including text, numbers, dates, images, and more. They can also handle complex data structures and relationships between tables.Multi-User Access: JET databases support multi-user access, allowing multiple users to work with the database simultaneously, though there can be limitations in terms of scalability and performance for large-scale applications.Integration: Access databases can be integrated with other Microsoft Office applications like Excel and Outlook, making it convenient for users to exchange data between different programs."
