      "A PSP file is a colored bitmap image created with PaintShop Pro. It is the native file format of PaintShop Pro and supports uncompressed, RLE compressed, LZ77 compressed, and JPEG compressed files (including Lossless JPEG). It also supports layers similar to PSD files and can have other information such as guides, metadata, and relevant objects within the image file. Each layer can be edited and integrated with the main image by its own. PSP files can be opened with PaintShop Pro software."
