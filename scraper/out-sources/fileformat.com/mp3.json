      "The MP3 file format, instantly recognizable by its .mp3 extension, is a landmark in digital audio technology. Formally defined as MPEG-1 Audio Layer III or MPEG-2 Audio Layer III, it was developed by the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG) and revolutionized music consumption through its Layer 3 audio compression. This powerful compression algorithm can reduce an audio file to roughly 1/10th the size of an uncompressed .WAV or .AIF file. This dramatic reduction in data was the key breakthrough that enabled the streaming of audio files over the internet, making online listening feasible for the first time. Furthermore, the sound quality of an MP3 is not fixed; it can be precisely controlled by adjusting key parameter settings like bit rate, sample rate, and the use of joint or normal stereo encoding, allowing for a customizable balance between audio fidelity and file size.Key Characteristics of MP3 Files."
