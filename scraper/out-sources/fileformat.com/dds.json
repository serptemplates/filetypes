      "A DDS file is a raster image file that utilizes the DirectDraw Surface (DDS) container format. It stores uncompressed and compressed (DXTn) textures and implements different types for storing different types of data. It also supports several different type of data such as single layer textures, textures with mipmaps, cube maps, volume maps and texture arrays. This enables the DDS files to store video game texture unit models in addition to digital photos and Windows desktop backgrounds. DDS file format was developed by Microsoft to be used with DirectX SDK."
