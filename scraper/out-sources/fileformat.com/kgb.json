      "A file with .kgb extension is a compressed archive file created with the KGB archiver software. KGB archiver uses the PAQ6 compression algorithm to compress the files into a KGB archive. KGB archiver has been discontinued and is no more used. KGB file format offers higher compression rates but at the cost of its minimum hardware requirements (recommend processor with 1,5GHz clock and 256MB of RAM) and extended compression/decompression time."
