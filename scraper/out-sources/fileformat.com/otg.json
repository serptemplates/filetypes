      "An OTG file is a drawing template that is created using the OpenDocument standard that follows the OASIS Office Applications 1.0 specification. It represents the default organization of drawing elements for a vector image that can be used to further enhance the contents of the file. OTF files are like any other OpenDocument format based files that are based on XML format to represent the contents of the document.
