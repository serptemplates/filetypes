      "M3U8 files are plain text files that contain a list of media files or streaming segments. Each entry in the M3U8 file refers to a specific media file (or segment) in the playlist. The file typically follows the following structure:\n\nHeader:The file starts with the #EXTM3U tag, which indicates that the file is an M3U or M3U8 playlist.In HLS streaming, the #EXT-X-VERSION tag specifies the version of the protocol being used.Metadata Tags:The M3U8 file contains metadata tags that provide additional information about the media. Common tags include:#EXT-X-TARGETDURATION: Specifies the maximum length (in seconds) of each media segment.#EXT-X-MEDIA-SEQUENCE: Indicates the sequence number of the first media segment.#EXT-X-KEY: Contains encryption information for the media segments.#EXT-X-STREAM-INF: Describes the media stream’s properties, such as bandwidth and resolution, for adaptive bitrate streaming.Media Segments:The file lists the individual media segments (such as .ts files) that make up the entire video or audio stream. Each segment contains a reference to a media file, such as:segment1.tssegment2.tsThese segments are typically small chunks of video or audio data, allowing the player to download and buffer only a small portion of the stream at a time for smoother playback."
