Amiga LZX compressed file is classified as a compressed file combined with compression standards used in files saved in the LZX format. This extension was initially used by applications designed for Amiga computers in the 1990s. the compression and decompression tools of different files are still applied with provision for compressing files and folders selected by the user as an LZX file. These related programs also have different cohesive features that can decompress these LZX files quickly than other archive files compressed with such old compression conditions."
