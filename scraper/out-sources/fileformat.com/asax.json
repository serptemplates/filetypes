      "A file with .asax extension is a file used by ASP.NET applications that resides on the server side. It contains code for responding to application-level and session-level events raised by ASP.NET or by HTTP modules. This also includes handling certain events when the application launches or shuts down. ASAX files are optional and only a single ASAX file is added to web applications to handle the application-level events and errors at the global level. Unlike ASPX pages, ASAX files do not contain any code to implement the functionality of the application."
