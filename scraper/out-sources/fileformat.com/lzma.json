    "description": [
      "A file with .lzma extension is a compressed archive file created using the LZMA (Lempel-Ziv-Markov chain Algorithm) compression method. These are mainly found/used on Unix operating system and are similar to other compression algorithms such as ZIP for minimising file size. LZMA is a legacy file format, which is being or has been replaced by the .xz format. The MIME type of the .lzma format is `application/x-lzma’. This file format was designed by Igor Pavlov for use in LZMA SDK."
