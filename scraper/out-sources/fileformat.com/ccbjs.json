      "A CCBJS file is a Javascript file created by the 3D app, game, and website editor, CopperCube. It contains the JavaScript code that is generated as part of the .html file created from the .ccb file. CopperCube provides a user-friendly scripting interface to develop gameplay logic and interactions without writing any code. Other file formats supported by CopperCube include .ccscene, .ccmodel, .ccmaterial, .cctex, .ccjs, .ccp, and .ccpak."
