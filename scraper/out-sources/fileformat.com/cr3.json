      "A CR3 file is a Canon RAW image file format that is created by selected Canon digital cameras. It was introduced by Canon to replace the CR2 file format and is used by some of the Canon digital devices. CR3 files store the original non-processed lossless image data captured by the camera. The use of these raw images provide high quality images and allow plenty of room for editing to photographers. In addition to main image data, CR3 files also store metadata information about the image."
