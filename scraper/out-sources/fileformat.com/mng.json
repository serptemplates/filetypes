      "A file with .mng extension is a Mutliple-image Network Graphics file format that is similar to PNG image format but supports animated images. It was developed to avoid overloading the PNG format with additional feature of animations. MNG is also similar to GIF files but uses more compression and supports full alpha feature. The unofficial MIME media type for MNG files is video/x-mng. MNG files can be opened in applications such as ImageMagik and IrfanView."
