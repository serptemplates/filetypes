      "A MOD file pattern is actually designed in a sequencer user interface as a table with one column per channel, So this table has four columns (one for each Amiga hardware channel. Each column has 64 rows).\n\nA cell in the table can cause one of the following actions to happen on its column’s channel when its row’s time is reached:\n\nStart an instrument playing a new note in this channel at a given volume, possibly with a special effect applied on itChange the volume or special effect being applied to the current noteChange pattern flow; jump to a specific song or pattern position or loop inside a patternDo nothing; any existing note playing in this channel will continue to play\n\nAn instrument is a single sample along with an optional specification of which portion of the sample can be repeated to hold a solid note."

      "The MOD file format, recognized by its .mod extension, is a landmark in digital audio history. It was originally developed as the Amiga module format by Karsten Obarski and launched with the revolutionary Ultimate Soundtracker software for the Commodore Amiga. Functioning as a music module file, it operates on a principle similar to a MIDI file but with a critical difference: it is a self-contained package that includes both the note patterns and the actual sound samples for each instrument. This means that every instrument, from drums to melodies, is played back precisely as the composer intended using the embedded samples. Due to its compact size and high-quality audio output, the MOD file became a staple for background music in video games and a foundational element within the creative, tech-driven demoscene computer art subculture."
