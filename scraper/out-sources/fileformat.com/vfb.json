      "A VFB file is a font file created with FontLab Studio. It stores font data such as shapes of letters, numerals, and symbols, in a digital format. The glyphs of these digital fonts make up the alphabet and other symbols. VFB file format stores font in a vector file format. This makes the glyphs independent of scaling without losing quality.\n\nYou can open VFB file using FontLab Studio and FontLab TransType Pro."
