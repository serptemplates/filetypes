      "A file with .mpc extension is a Musepack audio file format that uses audio compression with a strong emphasis on high quality. This makes it possible for you to not even notice the sound quality differences of original WAV file and the compressed MPC file. It uses MPEG-1 Layer-2 algorithms to achieve highly optimized compression. Musepack MPC file format is open source with BSD/GNU LGPL license. The SVN repository by Musepack allows to get latest updated code for the codec. Applications that can open MPC files include VLC Media Player, JetAudio, and Winamp in addition to several others."
