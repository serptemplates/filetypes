      "The RAF file format is associated with Fuji RAW image files, which are generated by Fujifilm digital cameras. The acronymn RAF stands for “Fuji Raw Image File.”\n\nRAF files contain minimally processed image data directly from camera’s image sensor. Unlike JPEG or other compressed image formats, RAF files are considered “raw” because they preserve all the original data captured by camera, including color information, exposure settings, white balance and other camera-specific metadata. This allows photographers to excercise having more control over editing and processing of their images.\n\nFujifilm consistently enhances the RAF format to incorporate features found in newer cameras. For instance, while most RAF files store uncompressed image data, the latest Fujifilm X-T3 and X-Pro2 cameras introduce the ability to compress RAF files, reducing their size and conserving storage space.\n\nMoreover, recent Fujifilm models like the X100V offer the capability to capture images in the HDR RAF format. When the HDR setting is enabled in RAW mode, the camera captures three images with varying exposure levels and stores them together in a single RAF file.",
      "The format of RAF file is binary format."
