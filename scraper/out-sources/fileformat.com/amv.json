      "The AMV acronym as Actions Media Video is classified as a video file format produced for Chinese portable MP4 media players and S1 MP3 players with video playback. The AMV video basically has two different formats: The earlier one for the Actions chip and the latest one for ALi’s M5661 chip; the format for ALi one was ALIAVI. The video format is a variant of Motion JPEG, with fixed rather than variable division tables. The audio format is a variant of IMA ADPCM. The first 8 bytes of each frame are origin, index, and several encoded 16-bit samples; usually, the AMV files play sound at 22050 samples/second. The AMV video is a compressed but low resolution (96x96 to 320x240 pixel), which can be played on the desktop using any media player software."
