      "A BR file is a compressed web file generated by applying the open source data compression algorithm, Brotli. It is used to store webpage assets such as stylesheets (CSS), images (SVG), XML, and scripting files (JS). Modern day websites, such as Chrome and Firefox, use BR files to reduce the page loading time, resulting in better user experience."
