      "A GDOC file is a shortcut file that points to a file located on Google Drive, a cloud-based document storage service. When Google Drive client is installed on a computer and a document is created inside it, the drive creates a document in the online cloud storage and writes the URL of this document in the GDOC file in local Google Drive folder. When this shortcut file is double clicked, the default web browser opens the document from the URL location. If this shortcut file is moved out of this folder, the link to online document is broken."
