      "7z is an archiving format for compressing files and folders with a high compression ratio. It is based on Open Source architecture which makes it possible to use any compression and encryption algorithms. The format is now supported by a number of software applications such as 7-ZIP which is publicly available for download and usage to manipulate .7z files. Files with .7z extension have mime-type application/x-7z-compressed."
