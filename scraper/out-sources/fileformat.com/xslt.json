      "A file with a .xslt extension is an Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformation file that is used to transform and style an XML file using XSL instructions. The format is used to transform XML documents into standard output formats such as a text document or .html web page. This transformation creates a new document based on the content of the existing XML document. XSLT is making it theoretically capable of arbitrary computations."
